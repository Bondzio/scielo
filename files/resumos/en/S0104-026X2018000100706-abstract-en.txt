Abstract: This article carries out a comparative study of the Italian cinematographic information related to the women&#8217;s sport disseminated in two historical periods: during fascism and in the first decade of democracy in Italy in the 1950s. The type of sports typically associated to women, as well as gender stereotypes featured in the most widespread newsreels kept in the Archivo Foto-Cinematografico Luce (Roma) during both periods are analyzed and compared. Through this study, it is possible to reveal the ideas that society had at that time on women&#8217;s participation in the field of sports. In addition, it allows to establish the evolution in the conception and social acceptance of women's sport.

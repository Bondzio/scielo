Abstract The study investigates the satisfaction with the work of the parliament of Brazilian Federal District. The survey was based on the competencies extracted from the institutional mission and targeted citizens who frequently use social networks. Inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. The results showed a great unsatisfaction about the institution. The most satisfied respondents are the youngest, the least educated, and the smallest family income, while the oldest, higher incomes and low education are the most unsatisfied. The results also highlighted the low interaction between respondents and the Chamber, the absence of an effective official communication channel, and actions associated with sustainable economic development will be more effective in increasing satisfaction.

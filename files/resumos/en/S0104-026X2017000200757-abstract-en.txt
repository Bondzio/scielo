Abstract This article is based on the narratives of domestic and care workers in Buenos Aires. Their trajectories are marked by migration, while the position they occupy in the division of labour in Argentina bears witness to the structure of various relationships of domination (gender, race, class). On this basis, we analyse the complexity of these relationships, as they are structured in the narratives offered by these subjects about their own life trajectories. In a first section, the article proposes a conceptualisation of the relationship between forms of dominations and subjects. In a second section, it provides an analysis of an individual trajectory that illustrates the complexity and variability of interconnected relationships of domination within the framework of a biography, and it illuminates the representations that are associated with it.

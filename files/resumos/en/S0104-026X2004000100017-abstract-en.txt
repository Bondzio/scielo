This text presents a discussion on the division of labor in a collective settlement of the Landless Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra - MST) in Santa Catarina, characterized by the collectivization of land and of all means of production. Within this form of organization and according to the directives established by the MST, an equalitarian and solidarious transformation of society, including the construction of new genre relations, is sought for. What has been noted, throughout the daily routine, is that men and women alike, both historical and cultural subjects, appropriate this discourse at the same time in which they try to deal with upcoming contradictions. Within the latter, and based on fixed relational standards, different work hours are thus established. Men are determined to work on a daily eight hour basis in production whereas women, due to domestic work and child rearing, are granted a four hour schedule.

The article considers the main dimensions of the conservative Catholic activism on sexuality by considering the encyclical Evangelium Vitae (1995). The analysis focuses on three dimensions: the opposition between culture of life and culture of death as the political framing; the displacement of conservative catholic activism in order to intervene in public debates; the main strategies to avoid sexual and reproductive rights. Through these dimensions, the article contributes to the understanding of the Catholic Church as a crucial player in contemporary sexual politics.

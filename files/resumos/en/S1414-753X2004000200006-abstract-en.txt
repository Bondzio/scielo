The study of natural hazards, developed by geographers since the 1930's, continues to evolve in parallel with discussions of reflexive modernization and the Risk Society.

In this article, we intend to recuperate the ways geographers have employed the terms risk and danger, seeking to communicate with other theories of risk and the study of its implications for populations.

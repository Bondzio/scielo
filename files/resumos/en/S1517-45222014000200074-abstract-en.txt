This paper seeks to expose solidarism as the "loss of the gift", as discussed by Mauss, by analyzing it in the colonial context, within the processes of current capitalist expansion. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is taken as object of analysis and hermeneutic mediation, as a form of solidarism whose practices lead to a set of situations that can be described as obscene. The argumentative strategy chosen to reach this proposed objective comprised: a) the synthesis of some theoretical guidelines that allow to understand the centrality of the gift and the description of our conception of solidarism; b) a triple analysis is performed on the conceptualization of CSR and on CSR experiences of some international corporations in Argentina; c) the explanation of our ideas on interstitial practices as gaps that break the moral economy while a totality that requires the "loss" of all kinds of gift.

Abstract: The article argues for a closer relationship between studies about the body, more specifically corporeal feminism, and environmental scholarship in philosophical and cultural studies. Because of the traditional association of nature with essentialism, the significance of materiality has tended to be overlooked in feminist theory. Through the use of the concept of &#8220;trans-corporeality&#8221; - the time-space where human corporeality is inseparable from &#8220;nature&#8221; or &#8220;environment&#8221; - as a theoretical site or epistemological space, richer and more complex modes of analysis may bring together &#8220;the entangled territories of material and discursive, natural and cultural, biological and textual&#8221;.

Abstract: The article analyzes the different receptions of the work of Brazilian sociologist Alberto Guerreiro Ramos to understand how his intellectual reputation changed. The main hypothesis is that one needs to articulate Ramos&#8217; sociological discourse to global sociology between 1950 and 1980. In order to achieve this goal, the author analyzes Ramos&#8217; intellectual production to illustrate both his sources and intellectual peers. This method proves how Ramos was up to date with the main sociological trends of his time. Therefore, his classical description as an outsider must be avoided.

This paper seeks to propose an anthropology of spatiality to understand the emergence of different global mobilization spaces that appear into an alterglobalist perspective. First, we share a portrait of the historical context that allowed the emergence of these spaces. Then, we present, analyze and compare the inherent logic in each one of the two selected cases, which appear to be particularly representative in the trajectory of global spaces of mobilization (the World Social Forum and the GlobalSquare). In the end, we seek to work with the hypothesis of an 'epistemology of paradox', that would be able to recognize the basic contradictions, specific to the studied processes and contribute to understanding the processes of mobilization, expanding its reach and strength.

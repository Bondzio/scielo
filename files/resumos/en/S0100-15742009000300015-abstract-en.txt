The primary purpose of the present investigation was to examine the relationship between bullying and different types of direct and indirect family violence. The research was conducted with 239 grades 5-8 students, 34.7% boys and 65.3% girls. A questionnaire was constructed, containing: questions involving socio-demographic variables; items of the Revised Conflict Tactic Scale, with the goal of examining the youngster's exposure to interparental violence; and items of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales, concerning physical and psychological abuse committed by parents against children. Bullying and victimization were measured by 26 items developed specially for the study's purpose, based on a modified version of Olweus' questionnaire. Associations were found between bullying and domestic violence, but these associations were different according to gender. Being exposed to domestic violence was associated with being a bully/victim in school (especially for girls), but not with being a victim of bullying. On the other hand, parental violence increased the probability of boys reporting being implied in bullying as victims or as bully/victims. In terms of the girls, suffering parental violence was only associated as being a bully/victim.

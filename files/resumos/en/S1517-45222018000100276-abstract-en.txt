Abstract The new readings of Marx, here represented by Backhaus and PostoneÂ´s thoughts, have the merit of proposing a reading of Marx&#8217;s mature work focused not only on the aspects of class and exploitation, but which stresses the broad character of the Marxian value theory as a way of characterizing modern society. Nevertheless, as we shall show, both readings end up focusing unilaterally on the sphere of commodities circulation, to the detriment of the value theory; accordingly, Backhaus and Postone revisit the analysis of the Grundrisse that Marx had subsequently surpassed.

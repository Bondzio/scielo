From the prospect of implementation of the Mercosul/UE agreement, which should allow the strengthening of the trade between the two blocks, we analyzed the possible gains in two alternative scenarios of integration using a Partial Equilibrium Model for the estimation of trade creation and trade deviation in the Brazilian Agricultural Export Sector. The results for the two levels of tariff reduction confirmed the expectations that the integration Mercosul/UE would provide significant commercial gains for the Brazilian agribusiness. In addition, the estimates of trade creation were for most of the simulations superior to those of trade deviation, confirming the productive efficiency and competitiveness of the Brazilian Agricultural Export Sector in the world economy.

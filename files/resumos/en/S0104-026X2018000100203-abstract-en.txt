Abstract: Our proposal is in the field of legal feminisms, an area that emerged in the 1970s in the US academy under the denomination Feminist Jurisprudence,Feminist Legal Studiesand Feminist Legal Theory. In Latin America and the Caribbean, this area is still incipient; there is, in this region a great deal of research not necessarily situated in terms of a juridical/legal feminist thinking, but connected intimately with that field and as part of the so-called gender perspectives in law. In this paper, we present some notes to support a reflection on legal feminisms in Argentina and Latin America, mainly from the 1990s.

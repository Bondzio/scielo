The most used statistical model to evaluate the relation between air pollution and population's health is regression analysis, as it is able to relate one or more explanatory variables with one response variable. This research aims to present the generalized linear model with Poisson regression. Every assessment step, from data collection and analysis to the verification of the chosen model adjustment, will be presented.

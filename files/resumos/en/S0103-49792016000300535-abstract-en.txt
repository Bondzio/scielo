In the last two decades of the 20th century, in Brazil as well as in other countries, the presence of transnational companies in the metallurgical and in the telecommunication industries has intensified, multiplying the processes of articulated productive restructuring globally. This article analyzes the internationalization of Brazilian trade union organizations since the 1980&#8217;s until 2010, ranging from the metallurgical trade union of the ABC region in the Greater São Paulo, affiliated to CUT (Central Única dos Trabalhadores &#8211; Unified Workers&#8217; Central), and the telecommunication union of São Paulo, affiliated to Força Sindical (Union Force). It was verified that in the 1980&#8217;s, the international relations were developed from outside to inside the country, but in the 2000&#8217;s Brazilian trade unions had become protagonists in the global scenario. Nevertheless, the development of international practices follows distinct parameters: sectorialized economic contexts or between organizational paths implied in a process of internationalization composed of different rhythms and intensities. While in metallurgical sector this process occurred gradually and in an organic way, in the telecommunication it was abrupt and reactive.

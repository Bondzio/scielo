Abstract Using the concepts of social accumulation of violence and criminal subjection this text aims to build a reflection about the transformations around the phenomenon of violence in the state of Alagoas. From the compilation of journalists&#8217; materials, official documents and interviews with agents of the state criminal justice system historically sought to situate the problem of violence in the region. Argue that over the last fifty years, the traditional crimes type killer rent to the &#8220;institutionalization&#8221; of extermination groups and from these to the phenomenon of proliferation of crimes of murder in the state, saw the accumulation of different violence forms and practices sedimented the creation of different dangerous types. Contrary to the analyzes that insist on interpreting the violence today exclusively as contiguity of past, argue that the explosion of homicides in the state is a peculiar event and relatively recent.

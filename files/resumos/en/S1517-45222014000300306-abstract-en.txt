The book describes research by Fabien Jobard, who developed his theory about the                police through the analysis of police violence incidents, supported by interviews                with people who experienced these unlawful acts and by matching these testimonies to                the discourses of both the press and the French courts. The result was the framework                of conditions that could trigger police violence, namely: the criminal purity of the                person assaulted, the possibility of the police officer being blamed for the                violence, the credibility of the witnesses, and the circumstances of the police                service. His genealogic narrative provides a better understanding of the state, the                violence (legitimate and illegitimate) and the police.

Abstract The present review essay focuses on the volume Gender and Work in Brazil and France: Intersectional Perspectives, edited by the sociologists Alice Rangel de Paiva Abreu, Helena Hirata, and Maria Rosa Lombardi. The review seeks to capture the general picture of the always quite complex relations that constitute and configure the world of gender, work, and caring in those two countries. The chapters in the book are discussed in some detail, so that the readers may glimpse the broad issues touched upon by the authors, including: gender inequalities and social rights; social ethics and social policies; social and sexual relations of power.

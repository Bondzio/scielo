In this paper, I compare the financial loan method of the "drop by drop" system with my experience as a volunteer at the Banco de la Esperanza in Urab√°, a region that has been, for at least four decades, considered one of the most violent regions of Colombia. Through this comparison, I proceed to analyze the relationship between what I call the idea of "permanent present" and certain aspects of the exchange, namely: "the habit of owing people money", "the need to borrow money" and the imperative that "everything must be given for free". In my case study, these effects represent fundamental aspects of community life and social reproduction. My specific aim is to explore the relationship between violence and economics, which is usually relegated to the realm of illegality.

Abstract The established relationship between the evangelical world and the Chilean military dictatorship is one of the most significant episodes of recent political and religious history in Chile. Although this phenomenon has been investigated as much by social sciences as by theology, its postures (positions) have tended to develop in a disjointed manner, offering a divided (splintered) image of the problem. The present article tries to make a contribution in this specific environment for which a concrete objective has been fixed: to analyze the distinctive ideological and political elements of the public declarations realized by the evangelical world up against the military government, joining them with the ideological contexts in which these declarations were emitted. For that, methodologically two fundamental declarations realized by evangelical leaders and pastors against the Chilean military regime (primary sources) have been analyzed, which will allow the image which is held about the relationship between the evangelical world and the Chilean military dictatorship to be made more complex.

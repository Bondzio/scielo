This article examines the integration process in South America under neodevelopment assumptions led by Brazil, from 2003 to 2014. This turn to the left is accompanied by a concern for economic growth with social justice, defense of regional integration under the post-neoliberal premises of international integration with a degree of autonomy and reinvigoration of the state&#8217;s role to achieve these purposes. The approach also considers the Chinese presence in the region, particularly its relationship with Argentina and Brazil. It aims to provide subsidies to clarify the following issues: this integration strategy led by Brazil, despite the defense of integration, intensified it? And what is the part of integration in the &#8220;turn to the left&#8221;? The analysis is guided by official documents and the literature, from a historical perspective.

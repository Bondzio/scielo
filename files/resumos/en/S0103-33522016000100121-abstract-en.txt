Abstract The paper tests the hypothesis that the Brazilian Political Science has little interest about Latin America, using the databases of CNPq and Capes about research groups and graduate programs and the editions available on SciELO of selected journals. All evaluated items, such as research groups that study Latin America, works about the region in the graduate programs and papers about Latin America in the selected journals, have expanded in the considered periods. On the other side, some data relativize this finding. Despite the expansion, the research and publication about Latin America in the Brazilian political science still are less than necessary for a country that prioritizes its insertion in the region. The explanation is that the discipline has methodological difficulties to include more cases in the studies.

Abstract Abstract: Dipesh Chakrabarty&#8217;s Provincializing Europe uses Martin Heidegger&#8217;s Being-with to ground his defence of a decolonial historiography. In this essay I show that Heidegger&#8217;s broader aims within Being and Time nullify Chakrabarty&#8217;s hopes for recovering fragile political spaces. In contrast to Heidegger, I propose Hannah Arendt&#8217;s writings on Jewish politics as an alternative for students of decolonisation. Arendt&#8217;s focus on plurality and new beginnings complement Chakrabarty&#8217;s critiques of historicism and political belonging in a way that more fully realises the broader ambitions of Provincializing Europe.

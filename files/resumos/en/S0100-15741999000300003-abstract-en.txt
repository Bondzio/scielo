This article describes the proposals, methodology and results of an evaluative study on the implantation of the Project for Accelerated Classes in the State of SÃ£o Paulo. Six case studies in schools where implantation was considered to have been successful, permitted the identification of the factors for success in the project. The analysis of performance tests and of the self esteem of student graduates of the accelerated (remedial) classes indicated the importance of incorporating evaluative measures over the long and medium term to help maintain the positive results achieved.

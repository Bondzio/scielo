This article analyzes the discourse about abortion diffused by the media during the 2010 election campaign. A qualitative, documental study was conducted using systematic data collection from the in print coverage of O Globo newspaper, and a random search in various media that approached both the subject and the relation between election controversies and religion during September and October 2010. The study focuses on the discourse presented in articles, and on repeated topics and actors. We emphasize the participation of religious groups in different positions not regarding abortion, but rather electoral support and alliances. The analysis shows that the subject's increased frequency in the media did not prompt a debate on the abortion problem in Brazilian society; instead, it was used as an accusing category and a divide between candidates, particularly in the presidential campaign. In contrast with the highlight given to the Catholic Church in similar events, the media revealed political and religious actors previously obscure.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main goal of this article is to provide a good basis to assess   the way media frames are embedded in a wider social scenario, and how public   and political preferences can be researched through media debate. The   methodology adopted allows for an analysis of newspaper articles that can show   broader trends of the debate and serve as a thermometer to measure public   debate. It can further highlight details and enable in-depth analyses of media   discourse.</font>    <br>     <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The article explores the interconnectedness of media debate and       policy-making process by means of the analysis of articles published in a       Brazilian newspaper between 2009 and 2010. Quantitative and qualitative       methodologies are employed to identify the frames used in media and to offer       insights of their relationship with the political debate. The ongoing political       debate has raised attention to the issue of migration, with a great numbers of       actors expressing very diverse points of view. A broader public debate has been       initiated and some portions of it find voice in different means of       communication. The paper argues that changes in the public and in the media       debate are a response to changes in the political debate, while at the same       time the first two also help to outline the latter. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Keywords:</b> migration;   public policy; media debate</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Migration public policies have received increasing attention in   public debate in the last few years, especially in countries with a large   migrant worker population. We can observe that the debate over migration in the   last decade showed a greater focus on national security issues, constituting   the main reasoning behind the proposition of more rigid entry and permanence   laws for migrants (Weiner, 1993; Rudolph, 2003). Weiner (1993) and Rudolph   (2003) argue that migrants can be perceived as threats to the geopolitical   security, to the production and accumulation of wealth, and to social stability   and cohesion, especially by bringing or creating political conflicts or through   the social and economic burden they can represent. The beginning of the   twenty-first century also saw terrorist attacks with the participation of   migrants, further increasing the perceived threats that migration poses to   national security.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Examples of public policies that aim at enhancing national responses   to the mass entrance of migrants and, particularly, at countering irregular migration,   include the Normative Resolution 97/2012 act from the Brazilian National   Immigration Council (CNIg), which restricts the number of humanitarian visas   conceded to Haiti nationals to 1200 per year, the European Union Directive   2008/115/CE, initiated by the European Commission and establishing the "common   standards and procedures for returning illegally staying third-country   nationals" (also known as Return Directive), or the Senate Bill 1070, of the   Arizona state in the United States of America, intending "to discourage and   deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by   persons unlawfully present" in the country (its most polemical provisions are   currently blocked by a preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge). All   of these policies have been highly criticised internally, by other countries,   and by international institutions because of their discriminatory provisions   and because they create the possibility of migrant human rights abuse. The fact   that these policies were approved is a response to parts of the domestic   population who feel themselves threatened by the growing migrant population,   either economically or because of cultural differences.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Brazil, the current law defining migrant policy was issued in   1980 (Law 6815/1980) and reflects an exaggerated preoccupation with national   security &#150; Ventura and Illes (2010) credit this preoccupation to how the   military government at the time perceived the Cold War. The national security   concerns are already evident in its first articles, which restrict the entry   and permanence of migrants for safeguarding national interests, namely,   national security and the protection of the national work force. At the moment,   the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, the lower federal chamber, is discussing a   proposed law from 2009 (PL 5655/2009), by the Ministry of Justice which is   designed as a substitute to the 1980 law. The proposal presents several   improvements towards a better protection of migrants' human rights, and a   public audience to discuss the project that was approved in late 2012 should   occur in the beginning of 2013. The proposed law reinforces the idea that all   migrants are warranted their rights and constitutional guarantees, as well as   access to education, health, and to the labour benefits system, irrespective of   their migrant status. Yet the proposed law also gives an even greater focus to   the duties of migrant workers, creating several mechanisms to stop their entry   and restraining certain rights (some aspects of political participation, for   example) and grants the Executive branch enlarged powers to act in the control   of migrant workers. According to Ventura and Illes (2010: 2), the proposed law   "introduces a large number of rights on general and abstract terms" and "an   even larger number of specific regulatory apparatus which restrict the meaning   or extent of those rights". The authors further state that the programmatic   mention of migrant workers' rights without some level of definition can be used   to render those rights ineffective in daily life, particularly because the   proposed law does not specify the roles of federal, state, and municipal   governments in guaranteeing those rights.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the discussions on the proposed law, the Brazilian National   Immigration Council (CNIg), a department of the Ministry of Labour in charge of   policymaking and immigration coordination<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a>, has presented   the government's "National Policy of Immigration and the Protection to the Migrant   Workers" in May 2010. The policy is marked by a strong preoccupation with the   migrants' human rights and their integration into the Brazilian market and   society, responding directly to some concerns of the migrant population in   Brazil and establishing a row of concrete actions to enforce the protection of   this section of the population's rights. One such action is the recommendation   to sign and ratify the "United Nations Convention on the Protection of the   Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families" in order to   reaffirm Brazil's commitment to the protection of migrant workers   internationally. The National Policy also introduces a technical qualification   program for public officials working in the registration of migrants to promote   a better orientation of migrant workers' rights and a more humane relationship,   one of the most common complaints from migrants who ought to be registered in   the Federal Police Office from the Ministry of Justice. Furthermore, the   document recommends the development of research and enquiries on the situation   of migrants and of the migrants' networks, stated as a necessary condition for   improving and proposing adequate public policies addressing the issue.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This research uses newspaper articles on migration public policies   and on migrants in order to help identify some of the major frames &#150; ideas that   help us give meanings to a theme &#150; on the issue of migration in the media   debate. We chose to analyse <i>Folha de S. Paulo</i> because it is Brazil's   most widely read national newspaper and because it represents an important   source of opinion diffusion and leadership, informing much of the political,   public, and media debate in Brazil. The analysis of one newspaper enables the   creation of a large panorama of the most important frames in the different   debates examined, even though, corresponding to the rationale we present below,   the inclusion of more newspapers could increase the diversity of points of   views captured. The objective of this analysis is to verify if the references   to migrants in the media debate can be linked to the development of a public   policy that either proposes better control and policing towards migrants or the   protection of migrants' human rights, advocating for a better social and   economic integration of this group. A total of 126 newspaper articles from 2009   and 2010 were examined in this study.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Two Different Perceptions</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Migration is a complex phenomenon that has its roots in different   economic, political, social, and environmental issues (Castles, 1986; 2006;   Freeman, 1995; Hugo, 1996; Mattar, 2012). Its complexity in forms and   motivations causes migration to be perceived differently by each country and to   be seen, at the same time and by both the sending and the host countries, as an   opportunity for growth and a problem.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remittances sent by migrants to developing countries have   transferred more than 300 billion dollars in 2010 (World Bank, 2012) and,   consequently, are an important part of the family income in the sending   countries. Furthermore, migrant workers have an important economic role in   supplementing the workforce and causing better economic allocative efficiency   and an increase in productivity, especially in countries or regions with scarce   labour or an ageing population (Freeman, 1995). The significant cultural gains   from the promotion of an exchange between host and migrant cultures are also   positive.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, migration also has negative consequences to both sides. To   the sending country, the "brain drain" effect (in which a significant part of   the specialised workforce moves to a developed country), combined with a lack   of motivation for seeking specialisation caused by low wages, obstructs   economic development, and increases dependence on external capital (including   capital sent by emigrants to their families)<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a>,   thus encouraging further emigration (Rosenzweig, 2005). Host countries have to   deal with irregular immigration, threat of unemployment (especially between   poorer working classes), lowering of wages, competition over social benefits   and resources, and concerns regarding the inclusion of culturally different   groups. Moreover, changes in values and national identity are frequently cited   as negative consequences arising from the presence of culturally different   populations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The perceived difficulties therefore affect both the local and the   migrant populations &#150; the latter being, in many cases, excluded socially,   economically, and politically from the community they live in. Koopmans and   Statham (1999) describe two main challenges to the contemporary nation state:   the post-national challenge, in which universal values prevail over the   internally accepted and determined ones; and the multicultural challenge, in   which the internal plurality of a community weakens the state's capacity to   maintain social order. The importance given to universal values and a community's   internal plurality affect how the legitimacy of a government's actions is   perceived. In most cases, these actions are perceived as failing or   illegitimate once the main cultural values change and problems with the   cultural integration of migrants occur.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The loss of legitimacy in the contemporary nation state is also   discussed by Hurrell (2007). Legitimacy, for that author, is expressed in five   different dimensions: shared understanding of justice, specialised and   specialist knowledge, reason-giving in light of shared principles inside the   political community, the process and procedure of its operations ("input   legitimacy"), and the effectiveness of those actions ("output legitimacy")   (Hurrell, 2007: 80-91). The importance of legitimate actions from a government   increases in so far as the distance between citizen and political actors   becomes greater. Legitimating its actions is a strategic attitude in the   national political game, and also internationally because it implies the   acceptance of the governors' authority and the citizens' disposition in   following the established rules (Hurrell, 2007: 78). It is a grave issue when   both local and migrant populations perceive the government's actions as   illegitimate. To the native population, this happens when state actions cannot   solve the problems brought by immigration (its effectiveness) or the principles   of social order are challenged by the migrant culture. To the migrant   population, state actions can be perceived as illegitimate when they are not   based on the same principles of justice or when their political community is   based in different reason-giving conducts, added by the fact that the migrants   are rarely allowed participation in the processes and procedures for   decision-making (input legitimacy). In Brazil, illegitimacy is often perceived   because government actions lack effectiveness in registering or controlling   migrants and in giving them access to their rights. A common argument is that   because Brazilian boundaries are extremely large and porous, the government is   unable to account for irregular entrances. For migrants, lack of effectiveness   is perceived when official information is contradictory, registration processes   are demanding and slow (a migrant identity card takes approximately one year to   be manufactured), and the government fails to guarantee access to justice,   health or education. Because migrants are denied access to most political   rights in Brazil, they also experience a lack of input legitimacy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The controversy about legitimacy loss leads to various reactions   from governments and societies regarding the integration of the growing migrant   community, two of which we shall analyse here. We focus our discussion on two   frames for the meanings attributed to migration and migrants: one that encompasses   the preoccupations with national security and one extending over the   preoccupations regarding migrants' human rights. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The increase of migrant populations initiates discussions inside a   political community that can be seen in national security terms, which relates   to the first frame we analyse. The national security frame focuses on the   burden migrant populations impose on internal social and cultural cohesion. The   presence of immigrants is seen as the focal point of social and economic   problems in the country, with the cultural differences between groups leading   to a perception of the decay of national identity values. Usually, this frame   highlights problems such as irregular migration and competition for social   benefits and stresses the idea of a loss of governmental control over the   migrant population.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the second frame, the source of social and economic hardship is   not ascribed to the presence of migrant populations, but instead is blamed on   society's and the government's failure in properly integrating those migrants   in the social, economic, and political domains, mostly by disrespecting the   principles of universal human rights. This lack of integration and the   disrespect for migrants' human rights is the main force driving the social   conflicts between native and migrant populations. This frame emphasises that   the migrant population does not share the same political principles and   reason-giving conducts as the native population, consequentially causing a   perceived lack of legitimacy in the government's actions. It could also suggest   the integration of the migrant population as a solution for the social and   political conflicts brought to light by the increase in the migrant population.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important to recognise that the focus given to each frame is   related to a given community's concept of citizenship and its organising   principles. Citizenship is a central concept to the study of migration because   it defines who is entitled to have their rights guaranteed in a nation state.   In most cases, migrants are entitled to economic, social, and cultural rights   but are barred from the majority of political rights, and because citizenship   cannot be understood in the absence of political rights, migrants cannot be   considered citizens until they naturalise in their host country (Reis, 2007).   We can relate two broad concepts of citizenship within the frames presented. If   citizenship is related to belonging to a specific social group and affiliating   oneself with a muster of national identity, it gives space for a stark   differentiation between "us" and "them" and places incentives to adopt the   national security frame. On the other hand, if citizenship is related to the   possession of the legal rights of individuals in the nation state, there is   more space for the adoption of the migrants' human rights frame.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first concept of citizenship &#150; communitarian citizenship &#150;   states that a mutual responsibility agreement and a shared common goods concept   are possible through a social process of constructing a political community   around common history, culture, language, and territory (Bellamy and   Warleigh-Lack, 1998: 459-460). Through this process, individuals and political   communities are able to establish who is entitled to rights, how the rights are   to be provided, and also consolidates individual commitment to a political   organisation &#150; the nation-state &#150; that guarantees the production and   distribution of public goods. The second concept &#150; cosmopolitan citizenship &#150;   reinforces the moral obligation of individuals towards all other human beings   and is based on the existence of bonds that create a human community, taking   precedence over one's nationality. This Kantian ideal of universal citizenship   is based on solidarity ties between all humans rather than on the existence of   a world government. Linklater (1998: 26) reminds us that the concept of   citizenship can have its moral dimension expanded, thereby facilitating the   defence of universal human rights, even in the absence of transformations in   the political boundaries of the nation-states or the constitution of a global   government.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The principles of how a community should organise itself are also   important in order to give prominence to one or the other frame in the   migration debate. Demant (2009) presents a study that can be useful in thinking   about the preferences of different societies when integrating migrants. The   debate about how many different groups can live together inside a political   community may admit to a classification along its two main characteristics: the   possibility of the existence of different cultures inside the same space and   the tendency of those groups to be in contact each other (Demant, 2009: 2). A   certain community might give preference to fewer and culturally similar groups   to live together, making up a more cohesive society ("cultural monism") or to   the coexistence of various groups, thereby forging a diverse society ("cultural   pluralism"). On the other hand, communities might understand that cultural   identity is relatively immutable ("cultural essentialism") or that different   cultures can combine different elements between them ("cultural evolutionism").   From the crossing of those two dimensions, four main routes appear to deal with   migrant population: societies which are "monist-essentialist" prefer little or   no diversity and do not believe in changes in cultural values, rejecting   migrants and giving preference to barring their entry, while   "monist-evolutionists", although also favouring the coexistence of culturally   similar groups, understand that migrants can be assimilated into the national   culture. "Pluralist-essentialists" can live with a diversity of cultural   groups, but do not believe in big cultural changes, preferring multicultural   policies and creating structures to guarantee autonomy and differentiation   between groups<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a>, while "pluralist-evolutionists"   also admit the existence of different cultural groups but believe that cultural   values can admit changes, leading to an integrationist perspective with the   creation of a new culture with elements from both the native and the migrant   cultures. Arguably, it is not the mere presence of migrants that guide the   composition of preferences, as migrants from culturally similar groups might   experience unhindered acceptance even in monist-essentialist societies. In all   kinds of societies there may exist a preferred type of migrant for whom   integration can present no great difficulties &#150; such as highly skilled workers,   investors, or people from a determined cultural group.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In general, "monist-essentialist" communities would be more prone to   adopt the national security frames, while "pluralist-evolutionists" would be   more prone to adopt the migrants' human rights frames. The other two groups   have a relatively more ambiguous relationship towards the two frames, but could   be more prone to adopt the national security frames as the migrant community   grows significantly once the hegemonic position of the native culture (or the   egalitarian relationship between them in the case of pure multiculturalism) is   challenged by the migrant culture.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brazil is a nation formed by many different migration flows   (Portuguese and West Africans in the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries,   Europeans, Middle-Easterners, and Japanese in the nineteenth and twentieth   century, and more recently, Chinese and South Americans since the last decades   of the twentieth century), and contributions from each migrant culture have   been weaved together to form a rather mixed and integrated national culture   where the boundaries of all these different contributions are now blurred (Prado   J&uacute;nior, 1994; Holanda, 1995; Ribeiro, 1995; Freyre, 2006). Accordingly, we can   recognise tendencies for a cosmopolitan citizenship concept, for example, in   the adoption of <i>jus sanguinis </i>and <i>jus soli</i> as a citizenship right   at birth, or in the low requirements for naturalisation, as well as a   "pluralist-evolutionist" approach to cultural differences. Disputably, we can   also identify some negative reactions to the integration of some cultural   groups in Brazilian history, for example in the resistance to integrating the   African or the Asian migrants and, more recently, the South Americans, while   there have been expressions of preference for specific kinds of migrants,   especially high-skilled workers.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Public Debate and Media</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This work means to clarify how the media debate could be linked to   the process of decision-making around public migration policies. In this   section, we first explain how the media debate can help us understand the   relationship between political actors and citizens in modern democracies, and   also how the use of particular frames in the media debate is related to the   public responses to different policies. We later present the main findings from   the analysis of the media debate over migration in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his "two-track model", Habermas (1997) explains how public debate   can be linked with the proposition of public policies: discussions arising from   the public debate are introduced by the mass media, themselves a source of   information about social demands for governors. Nowadays, mass media have   become the main space for political actors to communicate with citizens in   modern democracies, with both groups receiving and giving information through   the main means of communication. Citizens define their political preferences   through information publicised in the media and by means of periodic elections,   convert those preferences into political power, choosing governors and the   policies they want them to adopt. Correspondingly, political actors present   their points of view to citizens, obtain publicity for their actions, and also   receive information about citizen preferences through the media. Responding   adequately to those preferences help governors be elected to political   positions or keep them in their current positions (Habermas, 1997).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In our understanding, the media is a privileged <i>locus</i> for   visibility, with great reach and resonance in the public debate and the place   where symbolical disputes are discussed by different social and political   actors around certain understandings over the facts and information (Gamson,   1992; Van Gorp, 2005; Porto, 2007). According to Gamson,</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">we should think of them &#91;the mass media&#93; as the site of     a complex symbolic contest over which interpretations will prevail. This     cultural system encounters thinking individuals, and political consciousness     arises from the interweaving of these levels (Gamson, 1992: xi-xii).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The most significant political actors contend for a place to present   their understandings and frames inside the mass media system. Maia (2009)   clarifies that public visibility in the mass media is important for the   performance of four processes influencing the proposition of public policies: </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull;  defining public issues and proposing solutions     for those issues;</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull;  collecting citizen's preferences and organising     mobilisation around them;</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull; introducing public demands to elected     representatives;</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull; organising legislative pressure and monitoring     the political representatives' actions (Maia, 2009: 87)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Visibility in the mass media and, therefore, the chance to present   one's preferential frame involves much more than the simple understanding of an   issue. In other words, this understanding is directly linked to the ways the   issue is addressed. This means that a certain understanding about one issue   will have a role in shaping citizens' demands and priorities, in their   comprehension of how those demands affect their daily lives, and in thinking of   possible ways those demands could be addressed by the political representatives   who possess political decision-making power. If the most prominent frames in   the mass media place immigration as an issue related to the economic situation,   the debate will probably concentrate on labour legislation, social security, or   the role of migrants in maintaining the productivity level in an economic   system. If the discourse in the media debate is concentrated on social-cultural   issues, the debate will probably also have a focus on the integration of the   migrant and host cultures, and the impact of the migrant culture in the   national identity. Additionally, the media debate plays an important part   because it feeds discussion in other places too, for example in the political   institutions or the public debate that happens in other forums<i>.</i></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The method of content analysis used in this research aims to   identify the frames used in the media debate in order to observe which opinions   coming from the public or political debates reach the media. We especially   focus on the way migrants are represented in this discourse and the suggestions   on how the migrant movements should be dealt with. Here, we identify and   contextualise themes and frames presented in the news coverage from 2009 and   2010 and then observe how they are inserted in the broader social-political   scheme. This aids in clarifying the perceptions about the issues and their   resonance in the proposition of public policies.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Frames and the process of framing by the mass media have gained   importance for studies in politics and communication since the work of Erving   Goffman (1986) and Tversky and Kahneman (1981; 1984). In an earlier work,   Bateson (1972) highlighted the use of frames to focus on the inclusion of some   piece of information in the presentation of a message while excluding others   and to stress the existence of premises that guide us in the interpretation of   the message (Bateson, 1972: 144). Goffman (1986) picked up on this concept to   discuss the way frames help us organise our daily lives, offering "keys" and   "keyings" on the type of interaction for each case, for example helping us   determine whether something is a fight or a play of a fight. On their side,   Tversky and Kahneman used an experimental psychology study to show how the   presentation of some issues determines one's preferences by confronting people   with the same options who are "framed" as positive or negative and evaluating   the outcomes of their decision. The results suggest that the "framing of an   action sometimes affects the actual experience of its outcomes" (Tversky and   Kahneman, 1981: 458). As a consequence, presenting an issue in a different   manner "could influence the decision made &#91;...&#93; without distorting or suppressing   information, and merely by the framing of outcomes and contingencies" (Tversky   and Kahneman, 1981: 346). The relative importance of the frame in shaping   decisions is central to the study we propose here, as we are looking at the   interplay between media debate and policymaking processes.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While those authors concentrated more on conceptual reflections on   frames and framing, Gamson and Modigliani (1994; 1989) and Iyengar (1990)   focused on how media frames help define the descriptions and evaluations of a   determined issue. Gamson and Modigliani used focus groups to analyse how media   frames related to individual understandings of themes such as affirmative   action policies (1994) and the controversy around benefits and costs from   nuclear power (1989), while Iyengar (1990) studied how conceptions of the   causes of poverty shifted from societal to individual responsibility depending   on the way it was framed. Iyengar experimented with media frames that could   either have an episodic frame &#150; an article with a concrete and personal focus,   for example, a family's personal experience of poverty &#150; or a thematic one &#150; an   abstract and impersonal article with background information, for example, on   the poverty rate and the outcomes of different policies (Iyengar, 1990: 22) &#150;,   finding that episodic frames tended to place the focus of responsibility for   poverty on individuals, while the thematic frames favoured societal   responsibility in surveys after media exposure.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Describing the growing interest in the theme, Entman (1993) notices   an astonishing diversity in the uses of the concept of framing. The author   discusses many disputed conceptualisations of framing, while noting its   relevance in defining problems, diagnosing causes, making moral judgements, and   suggesting remedies (Entman, 1993: 52). Entering a central debate to the   framing processes, Entman stresses that frames in the mass media are not simply   manipulated by individuals and that culture can be perceived as a stock of   commonly invoked frames (1993: 53) that are then used by journalists in the   media (Gitlin, 1980; Maia et al., 2008). Entman ascribes the   inclusion/exclusion tension of frames a central role in the concept and,   according to him, "exclusion of interpretations by frames is as significant to   its outcomes as inclusion" (1993: 54). In the study proposed here, we assume   that different frames to an issue exist in our society, but the work of the   media in only highlighting some of them is central in increasing their   publicity in the public and political debate, while the ones excluded remain   partially invisible in all three forums.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scheufele (1999) proposed an organisation of the field according to   the manner in which a frame is analysed and observes that frames can be   investigated from two main perspectives. In one perspective, frame studies can   focus on how the individual or the media use different frames. Alternatively,   they can focus on the frame either as the outcome of a series of events   (dependent variable) or as the effect leading to some other process   (independent variable) (Scheufele, 1999: 109-110). Scheufele then develops a   model of framing that attempts at highlighting the inputs, processes, and   outcomes involved in the framing of an issue for both the media and the   audience and makes an effort to place different studies along this process   model, helping recognise each study's contribution in a systematic and coherent   manner. The research proposed here focuses mainly on the outcomes of the media   processes of framing, while also looking briefly at the inputs for this process   when we reflect about how public policy can inform media debate.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In sum, the concept of frame used in this research is close to that   of Gamson and Modigliani, who define it as "a central organising idea or story   line that provides meaning to an unfolding strip of events, weaving a   connection among them. The frame suggests what the controversy is about, the   essence of the issue" (Gamson and Modigliani, 1994: 376). For our study, we   place the creation and existence of frames in their wider social cultural   background, but we stress the selection process from mass media actors when   publicising an issue.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to identify frames in newspapers articles, we start by   following the steps of Vimieiro and Dantas (2009), who suggested that frames   can be observed in news coverage from two of the frames' main characteristics   in the social reality: their semantic organisation function and their structure   for the social world function. The two authors tried to put into operation the   frame characteristics pointed out by Reese (2001), and Gamson and Modigliani   (1989)<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a>. The first function,   organisation, develops the understandings associated to a certain theme, for   instance, if the theme is presented in a positive or a negative manner or in   terms of gains and losses (a cognitive organisation of frames). According to   Reese (2001), there is also a cultural dimension to organisation, referring to   the shared cultural values activated when the issue is presented, thereby   allowing the reader to make connections to a broader setting instead of just   the specific case. The author uses the examples of "Cold War" or "War on Drugs"   to explain the cultural dimension of the organisation function. The second   function, structure, is related to the symbols activated in relation to the   issue, as such symbols have a great emphasis in the process of attachment to   larger cultural ideas. Reese argues that some structures can be very explicit,   but sometimes they also are intricate and implicit. In journalism, structures   of meaning can be identified by the inclusion/exclusion of information (Reese,   2001:17). In the case of migration, we could mention the inclusion or exclusion   of information about the importance of the migrant workforce to the recent   economic situation.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In practical terms, Vimieiro and Dantas (2009) suggest that we can   recognise frames in news articles by identifying actors referred to,   illustrating images, terms defining the issue, proposals for solutions,   metaphors, and moral judgements. A similar model for the analysis of political   debates in the means of communication is proposed by Porto (2007) in order to   clarify the "interpretive frames" and the symbolic disputes in which they are   embedded. The author identifies five dimensions that help identify the   connections between interpretive frames and the issue at hand:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull;             definition&nbsp; of the issue (a);</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull;             assignments of responsibilities and causes (b);</font></p>       ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull;             evaluations of the importance of the issue or     event (c);</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull;             arguments over consequences (d);</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&bull;             proposals for solutions (e). (Porto, 2007: 31)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can see that three of those dimensions are also in the research   by Vimieiro and Dantas (2009), but the evaluation of the importance of the   issue and the arguments over the consequences will be included in this research   as migration issues receive a lot of attention described along those   dimensions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To describe the debate in newspaper articles, we are also looking   for additional information to assess the importance journalists give the theme,   which, in turn, reflects how relevant the issue is in the public debate. The   section in which the article is printed indicates the context in which the   issue is presented (for instance, an article about migration could be in the   economy or in the crime sections), opinion editorials organise and summarise   some of the information, and the greater relevance of an issue brings it to the   front pages of the newspaper. In this sense, we are looking for information in   the news articles that qualifies the frames but also helps us place the public   debate about migration:</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n1/a05tab01.jpg">Table 1</a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The research was performed with all   articles published in the Brazilian newspaper <i>Folha de S. Paulo</i> in 2009   and 2010 which mentioned migration, the situation of migrant workers in Brazil,   the situation of Brazilian migrant workers in other countries, and which   debated migration public policies. The period reflects the initial discussions   of the Proposed Law 5655/2009 in the lower legislative chamber and the   publication of the "National Policy of Immigration and   the Protection to Migrant Workers". <i>Folha de S. Paulo</i> was chosen because   it was the best-selling daily newspaper with nationwide issue in Brazil at the   time<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a>,   and the articles were selected using a keyword search<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a> in the newspaper online archive. In total, 270 articles mentioned the selected   keywords, 36 of which mentioned themes excluded from this research (migration   movements inside Brazilian borders or foreign investment). In addition to the   categories mentioned above, three theme-specific categories were created to   help qualify the articles: a category to help qualify the article as related to   the frame "national security" or "migrants' human rights", a category to   indicate a very famous case in Brazil during the period regarding the Italian   activist Cesare Battisti<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a>, and a category to   identify whether the article made reference to the Proposed Law 5655/2009 or to   the National Policy on Immigration and Protection of Migrant Worker.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The great controversy caused by the   Battisti case attracted much media interest and was the theme of 106 news   articles in the two years studied. After being analysed and codified, those   articles were excluded from the research results. Articles about the case   accounted for nearly half of the news articles produced, and the judicial   dispute was prominent among them. Because they dealt with a single and specific   case and debates focused more on the processes of extradition and the status of   this political refugee, this coverage created a bias in the media debate about   migration in Brazil. Therefore the research <i>corpus</i> is composed of 126   news articles.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The analysis level adopted here was the   category actors. Information given by each actor was codified using the   different categories presented above<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a>. For example, the   article "Law that grants amnesty to illegal foreigners in Brazil is approved",   on 03/07/2009, was codified using three different actors. The journalist   presented one "argument over consequences" is that the immigrants would now   have access to health, education and work, while president Lula presented a   "moral judgment" that states that migration policy in rich countries is unfair;   and the Minister of Justice, Tarso Genro, presented a "definition of the issue"   when he stated that migration policies in certain countries criminalise   migrants. All three statements were identified with the frame "migrants' human   rights". The choice of using actors on the analysis level allows for a more   detailed description of the debate, making it possible to see the actors behind   each point of view expressed and evaluate the contributions of each group of   actors to the debate.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In all 126 news articles, 138 different   actors presented 291 statements classified under one of the textual categories:   definitions of the issue, causes of the issue, evaluation over the importance   of the issue, metaphors and examples, moral judgments, arguments over   consequences, and proposals for solutions. The most frequent themes of the   statements were Politics, with 42% of the articles referring to it (124   statements), followed by Economy with 24% (71), Crime with 12% (35) and   Demography with 10% (28). Themed under "Demography", for example, there is the   article "Brazil did in decades what Europe took centuries to do" (06/09/2009),   which discusses the fast process of ageing and the reduction of birth rates in   the Brazilian population and the need to count on international migration   which, the journalist points out, has been associated with cultural changes,   social conflicts, and xenophobic reactions (definition of the issue).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Journalists were by far the most frequent   group to present statements. As many as 67% (197) of the 291 statements were   made by journalists, followed by Specialists representing 16% (49) of the   statements, members of the Executive, 9% (27), and Civil Society organisations,   2% (7). It is remarkable that migrants were almost absent from the discussion,   only presenting 4 statements (1%), as well as Brazilian citizens, who presented   only one statement on the issue of migration between 2009 and 2010. From the   total statements, 46% (133) referred to the national security frame, 29% (85)   referred to the human rights frame, while 25% (73) of the statements refer to   neither of the two frames. One example of the statements referring to the   national security frame appears in the article "Terrorism in the Brazilian   agenda" (16/06/2009), in an opinion editorial where a specialist in terrorism,   Andr&eacute; Lu&iacute;s Woloszyn, states that the increase and ease of international   migration is one of the causes of the current expansion of terrorist networks   (causes of the issue).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking at the frames data, we can clearly   see the prominence of statements that can be qualified under the frame of   national security rather than the ones under migrants' human rights. However,   different political and public events have a large influence on the frames   presented (see <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n1/a05gra01.jpg">graph 1</a>). We speculate that the global economic crisis may   account for the larger concentration of the national security frame in the   first months of 2009. In the same sense, in October 2009 there is a prominence   for the migrants' human rights frame, mostly due to the publication of a study   advocating for migration as a fundamental human right by the United Nations   Development Program (UNDP, 2009). <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n1/a05gra01.jpg">Graph 1</a> shows the distribution of statements   divided by each frame:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The quantitative data is presented clustered in months to show   the broader patterns involving the frames. Furthermore, it also helps to   aggregate them when looking for information over the two frames, because not   all articles featured statements that could be related to one or the other   frame. This situation reveals the value of expanding the research to include a   larger timeframe or articles from other national newspapers in order to have   more robust and reliable data.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The quantitative data showed an interesting relationship between   news sections and frames. The section that concentrates the majority of   national security frames is "Money" (Economy section), with 57% (24) of   statements in this section with the security frame against 10% (4) of human   rights frames. Articles in this section are highly marked by discussions   referring to the global economic crisis as well as national security concerns   raised by economic hardship. The foreign issues section, "World", has 54% (36)   of statements with the security frame against 36% (24) of human rights frames.   Conversely, the "Power" section, comprising Brazilian Politics issues and the   opinion page, is much more balanced. In this section, 42% (41) of statements   presented the national security frame and 38% (37) the human rights frame. This   scenario is also supported by the qualitative analysis which shows that the   sections "Money" and "World" referred mainly to discussions over the economic   crisis abroad, discussed other countries' propositions to expand regulations   over migrants, and published news about the fiercer tensions with irregular   immigrants in foreign countries, including Brazilian emigrants. The section   "Power" mostly had news about the Brazilian political debate and migrant   regulation and integration in Brazil. As the country has fewer conflicts with   its migrants and was not so seriously affected by the global economic crisis,   news in this section more often referred to the increasing need for migrant   labour and discussions about changing the regulations to provide more security   for migrant workers and investors.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the next paragraphs, the discussion concentrates on two   categories: the actors and the textual categories. The analysis of the   statements presented by each actor reveals some interesting features of the   public debate and, at the same time, shows the way journalists organise their   messages in the news. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Specialists (professors, analysts, researchers, etc.) had a fair   participation in the debate: they are the second group most frequently invited   into the media debate, followed by members of the executive branch. News   articles usually use the statements from specialists to introduce the debate to   the readers, especially in the categories definition of the issue, causes of   the issue, and arguments over consequences. This is the case of the political   scientist Demetrius Papademetriou, who speaks about how the 2008 economic   crisis is different from its precedents at the end of the twentieth century and   the beginning of the twenty-first century (definition of the issue) because it   is more severe and happens in a time with bigger migration flows (causes).   Presenting solutions for the issue is a task given to political actors,   especially members of the executive and legislative branches like a senator   from the U.S. Congress, Chuck Grassley, quoted in his proposition to dismiss   migrant workers first (solution) in order to guarantee the protection of   national labour (definition). The civil society, although given limited   participation, was called to debate causes and consequences of the issue, as   did the secretary of the organisation "Continental Cry from the Excluded", Luiz   Bassegio, stating that unemployed migrants prefer to stay in Brazil because of   health and education services and in the hope of finding work (causes).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As stated, journalists themselves were the most recurrent group in   the news articles. Their participation was more evenly distributed in all   categories, but they were mostly in charge of discussing the causes of the   issue, presenting definitions, presenting metaphors and examples, and   presenting arguments over consequences. Immigrants and emigrants rarely had the   opportunity to present their problems personally, or even to contribute to the   discussion over possible solutions. Their quotes are mostly limited to   anecdotal statements, retelling situations from their lives or illustrating the   situations presented by journalists. Because of that they rarely present any   textual category. For instance, the Japanese immigrant to Brazil Yukio   Yamashita uses the metaphor of confinement to talk about his early life in   rural migrant working colonies in the beginning of the twentieth century. We   can note that migrants are almost absent from this discussion, and even though   they are the focus point of the debate they have strikingly little   participation in the textual categories.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These journalistic choices reflect how the media debate is organised   (solutions are presented by political actors, migrants present examples and   metaphors from their daily life) and give us insights on how the public debate,   inside and outside the media, organises itself. However, the presence of journalists   as the most recurrent group in the news articles and in the presentation of   textual categories reminds us of their job in mediating and selecting the   information in the newspapers. Traquina (2001) alerts us to the fact that   journalists are subject to cultural and institutional influences, and he also   calls attention to the circumstances around the production of the piece   (resources, availability of sources and time, for example) in the construction   of printed discourse (Tuchman, 1978; Scheufele, 1999). Acknowledging the role   of journalists in newspapers, we can still use the articles as thermometers to   measure the broader trends of the public discussion around an issue, especially   in indicating the prevailing trends and points of view in the debate.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the newspaper   articles, we can also discuss some findings about the two frames of national   security and migrants' human rights and how they appear to the public in the   newspaper. The first observation is the lack of articles mentioning the debate,   the legislative process, possible outcomes or the results of the Proposed Law   5655/2009 and the National Policy on Immigration and   Protection of Migrant Worker &#150; resulting also in the lack of discussion about the   inconsistencies between the premises of both. Only one article mentioned the   Proposed Law, in defence of a new regulation pertaining to human trafficking.   According to the National Secretary of Justice, Romeu Tuma J&uacute;nior, one of the   consequences of giving incentives to regular migration is diminishing human   trafficking (arguments over consequences), as the latter is closely connected   with irregular migration flows (causes of the issue).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We have already said that the national security frame has preponderance   over the migrants' human rights frame, but very interestingly there are   differences in the textual categories associated with each frame, meaning that   the structure of the debate changes between both frames. The national security   group makes major use of the categories "causes of the issue", "definition of   the issue" and "metaphors and examples", and furthermore mentions several times   that the recent economic crisis is the main reason behind migration policies   that suggest more control over migration flows. In statements related to this   frame, there is also a preponderance of negative references and metaphors to   describe immigrants, for instance "illegal", "irregular", "black sheep", or   "invaders". On the other hand, in the articles related to the migrants' human   rights frame, most statements come under the "arguments over consequences",   "definition of the issue" or "proposals for solutions" category. The most   quoted statements tend to explain the advantages of inclusive public policies   for migrants (arguments over consequences) to advocate for the respect of human   rights as a possible solution for the issue of integration or to discuss the   proposition of voting rights to migrants (proposals for solutions).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The analysis of the media debate about migration points to a   restricted discussion involving a small number of actors which can in turn mean   that there are limited points of view in the debate about migration in Brazil.   The debate is mostly focused on specific events such as the publication of   reports, analysis of political or economic scenarios, or police operations that   trigger a small amount of publicity to the theme of migration. Much of the news   coverage in the period actually discussed policy changes in other countries or   significant cases involving migrants outside Brazil. Another sign that the   media debate is still underdeveloped in Brazil is that the concerned population   &#150; migrants &#150; are almost always absent from the discussions. Despite these   limitations, it is an important feature of the media debate that the actors who   take part in it perform the same roles that they already occupy in the   political or the public debate. For example, specialists are called to   introduce and analyse the situation, political actors to present solutions, and   the civil society to debate causes of the issue and its consequences. In the   same sense, although the specific events regarding the political debate on the   Proposed Law and the National Policy have not been discussed in the media,   other political and public events have fed the discussions in the newspaper,   which further connects the media debate to the other two debates. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Concluding Remarks </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We claim that the present method for quantitative and qualitative   analysis of the media debate about migration in the newspaper <i>Folha de S.     Paulo</i> in 2009 and 2010 is useful to show some broad tendencies of the   recent public debate over the issue and show some opinions coming from it. The   combination of those two types of analysis is a good contribution to recognise   variations on the debate and identify how migration is shown in the newspapers.   The importance of the political and economic context in the choice of themes   and frames in the news indicates that the media debate is closely related with   the debates going on in public and the political debate &#150; the asserted   influence of the 2008 economic crisis on the prevalence of the national   security frames is one example. Ideally, the expansion of the period studied   and the number of newspapers analysed can provide more information about   diversity in the media debate.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also a very important finding that the roles played by   specific groups of actors in the media debate are in line with their presumed   roles in the political and public debates. We believe that this fact reinforces   our supposition that the media debate works in connection with the public   debate and can be a good site for the analysis of current and past opinions and   points of view about an issue.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding the debate on human rights, the great majority of   references are about human rights already guaranteed to migrants, such as   access to the labour market, education or justice, and the debate lacks   discussions about the expansion of rights, for instance, the right to vote.   Even though the news articles in this study do not directly mention the   legislation or the public policies for migration, we can observe a link between   them to the extent that elements from both the Proposed Law and the National   Policy are also constant in the media debate. The importance of international   human rights regimes and the necessity for a clear integration policy for   migrants &#150; elements from the National Policy &#150; are mentioned many times in the   news coverage. The same is true for statements that make the case for broader   governmental control over migrant workers or the precedence of the national   citizens' rights over migrants' rights. Both are components of the Proposed Law   and of some news articles, especially at the beginning of the year 2009 when   the legislative discussion started in the Congress and the effects of the 2008   economic crisis could be felt more intensively.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Submitted in February 2012<br />   Accepted in March 2013</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Notes</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="#_ednref1" name="_edn1" title="">1</a> In the Proposed Law 5655/2009, the CNIg   would be renamed the National Council of Migration and its responsibilities   would be expanded to also act in the protection of emigrated Brazilians and the   policymaking regarding both the immigration and emigration of peoples.<br />     <a href="#_ednref2" name="_edn2" title="">2</a> The World Bank published, in April 2010, a   series of data showing that developing countries are significantly more   dependent on international remittances than developed countries. In 2008,   developing countries have, on average, received an amount of remittances   corresponding to 2% of their Gross National Product (GNP), while in developed   countries it corresponded to 0.2% of their GNP on average. The data also shows   some developing countries that are extremely dependent on international   remittances such as Lebanon (where the remittances corresponded to 20.4% of the   country's GNP in 2008), Honduras (20.4%), and Haiti (20.3%). Data were obtained   from estimates by the World Bank based in the <i>International Monetary Fund's     Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook </i>2008, (World Bank, 2010).<br />       <a href="#_ednref3" name="_edn3" title="">3</a> The concept of consociational politics,   from Lijphart (1968) is one example of how a society could organise itself as "pluralist-essentialist". Variations in the   multicultural policies could give way for the hegemony of one cultural group,   in which case this "pluralist-essentialist" society could be called   "communalist".<br />     <a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" title="">4</a> Originally, Reese described six   characteristics of frames:   organising, principles,   shared, persistent, symbolically, structure ("Frames are <i>organising principles </i>that are<i> socially shared </i>and<i> persistent over     time, </i>that <i>work symbolically </i>to<i> meaningfully structure the social       world</i>") (Reese, 2001:11-12). &#91;Emphasis added&#93;.<br />         <a href="#_ednref5" name="_edn5" title="">5</a> The Instituto Verificador de Circula&ccedil;&atilde;o   (IVC), which inspects the print publications in Brazil places <i>Folha de S.     Paulo</i> as the best-selling daily newspaper between 1986 and 2009. In 2010,   the newspaper Super Not&iacute;cias, a popular tabloid, became the best-selling daily   newspaper in Brazil, but it only prints local issues in the city of Belo   Horizonte. At the time of this research, <i>Folha de S. Paulo</i> was the only   large national newspaper with an online archive search tool that enables   keyword query in specific time periods.<br />     <a href="#_ednref6" name="_edn6" title="">6</a> Searched keywords (in Portuguese):   migrant; migrants; immigrant; immigrants; emigrant; emigrants; migration;   migrations; immigration; immigrations; emigration; emigrations; foreigner;   foreigners (migrante; migrantes; imigrante; imigrantes; emigrante; emigrantes;   migra&ccedil;&atilde;o; migra&ccedil;&otilde;es; imigra&ccedil;&atilde;o; imigra&ccedil;&otilde;es; emigra&ccedil;&atilde;o; emigra&ccedil;&otilde;es; estrangeiro;   estrangeiros; estrangeira; estrangeiras).<br />     <a href="#_ednref7" name="_edn7" title="">7</a> Cesare Battisti is an Italian citizen   arrested in Brazil at the end 2007, charged with four murders in Italy since   1987. The crimes were committed at the end of the 1970s, a time when Battisti   was supposedly a member of an armed extreme left group, which Battisti denies.   The activist was accepted as a refugee in France until 2004, when the French   government issued his extradition to Italy. The activist then escaped to   Brazil. At the end of 2008, the Minister of Justice in Brazil gave him the   status of political refugee, claiming a "proven fear of persecution because of   his political ideas" and in opposition to a decision in favor of his   extradition by the National Committee for Refugees. The case received a lot of   attention in Brazil and in Italy and has been analysed in different aspects by the Brazilian Supreme Court, which, in the   end, gave the president the final word about the extradition. President Lula   rejected the extradition in his last day in office in 2010, and this decision   was once again analysed and ratified by the Supreme Court in 2011.   Battisti now has a refugee status in Brazil and was released after staying in   prison for more than 4 years in Brazil.<br />     <a href="#_ednref8" name="_edn8" title="">8</a> We performed an agreement test with a   sample of the news articles. In total, the analysis of 12 news articles and 120   textual categories were compared between the two independent raters. The raw   agreement coefficient scored 0.6, while the Cohen's kappa coefficient rated   0.58, suggesting moderate agreement between raters.</font>     </h6>       ]]></body><back>

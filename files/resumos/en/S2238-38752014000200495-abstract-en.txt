Abstract Why some men marry older women? Why some women marry younger men? What are the major capitals of these marital arrangements? This article aims to analyze female and male discourses about marriages in which women are older than their husbands, using survey data from my research "Body, aging and happiness". The results of two focus groups are analyzed: the first with twelve women married to younger men, the second with ten men married to older women. The results of nine in-depth interviews, five with men and four with women, are also examined. I worked with couples that have been together for at least ten years. The women are at least ten years older than their husbands.

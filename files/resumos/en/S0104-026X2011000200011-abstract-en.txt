This study aims to investigate the concepts of gender of a group of students from the Faculty of Education, who already work as teachers in schools. For this research, a qualitative and analytic-descriptive typology, we used a semi-structured interview with the students. The construction and analysis of the object were based on theoretical studies of Michel Foucault, Joan Scott and Guacira Lopes Louro. We found that these teachers lack a training in theories and discussions focusing on sexuality and gender issues.

In this article I discuss the presence of the religious dimension in the biomedical area manifested in the discourses, practices and behaviors of these professionals in Lisbon, Portugal, when the issue is abortion. At the same time I observe that such religiosity does not configure itself homogeneously among the subjects, because many, claiming to be conscience objectors, use this protocol as symbolic power affecting women in their reproductive rights. Twelve semi-structured interviews were made during the sandwich doctorate with health professionals who work in different hospitals in Portugal.

Responding to P. Molinier s work, this article looks to explore the continuities and ruptures between the care situation in the French institution analysed by the author, and our own research field in SÃ£o Paulo, involving female social workers. First we examine how access to the field produces distinct relational configurations between researchers, interlocutors and the research subject. This is followed by an exploration of how care work reveals particular features when agents and users have the same social background, and their actions are developed in the same context.

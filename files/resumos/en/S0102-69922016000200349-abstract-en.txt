Abstract The aim of this article is to analyze the trends of the postal system on the international scene with a focus on market regulation mechanisms and the restructuring of the organizational models of public operators towards corporatization and privatization, showing the impact on the sphere of work. The article was developed through a documentary and bibliographic research and secondary data of the Universal Postal Union. For this, were compiled and analyzed reports produced by multilateral organizations and regional blocks. Among the main findings, there is the liberalization of postal markets as the predominant tendency associated with gradual processes of market concentration and consequent formation of oligopolies, mainly by transnational groups. The postal liberalization has been accompanied by organizational restructuring and privatization of state-owned operators proceedings under the justification of administrative modernization. Furthermore, there are increasing operational restructuring and concomitant job precariousness and increase reduction of jobs in the sector.

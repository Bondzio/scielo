During the Vargas dictatorship, Brazil underwent a strong xenophobic, anticommunist process. The sectors in power sought to guarantee that process without making room for the middle and working classes&#8217; new revindications, which had been amplfied and differentiated by industrialization and urbanization. Anti-Semitic values present in Brazilian imagery were accentuated by World War II and the assimilation of Get&#250;lio, Filinto Muller, G&#243;is Monteiro and the Integralists&#8217; to the Nazis. The Inquisition and the Catholic Church&#8217;s contributions to the formation of Brazilian mentality created conditions which allowed Jews living in Brazil to be deported to concentration camps. This investigation was based on life histories.

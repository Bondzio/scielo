Abstract Brazil has faced in 2013 some forms of social contention that offer instigating problems to political science. The article departs from this context to comprehend by the means of a case study the Front of Struggles for the Public Transportation (FLTP) in the city of Goiania. The question that leads the research is the following: what could be concluded, from the case of FLTP, about the most common generalizations concerned to the place of the events, the protesters grievances, and the links between activism and repression during the protests that took place in Brazil in 2013? Such wide question is approached from three perspectives, namely: the relation between the case and the colonial tensions that confront Brazilian political center, placed in Southeast, to the peripheral regions, such as the Central West (i); the relation between the FLTP and political parties or other social movements, specially under the criterion of the cohesion or focus of the grievances (ii); and the relation between FLTP and the state persecutory apparatuses. The article comprises a case-study based on the methodology of action-research. Its main result is the refutation of three common generalizations about Brazilian protests in 2013, related to the place where the protests began, the claims presented by the adherents and the relation between police repression and the demonstrations.

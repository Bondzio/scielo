Abstract The text presents an incursion in the articles by the french sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002), published in the scientific journal Actes de la Recherche en Science Sociales (ARSS) having education as its subject. Created by Bourdieu in 1975 and directed by him until his death, ARSS received eleven of his articles (being four as co-writer) between the years of 1975 and 2000. Emphasising that in the pages of the periodical the author &#8220;drafted&#8221; several papers that would become his books. In these presented texts Bourdieu reafirms the relevance of the sociology of education as an important chapter of the sociology of knowledge and the sociology of power, granting a real programme of investigation to unfold the instituted mechanisms in the production of the domination and the strategies of reproduction in the contemporary society class.

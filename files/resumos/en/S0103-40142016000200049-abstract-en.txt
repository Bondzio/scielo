abstract This paper aims to identify and analyze, from a historical perspective, the social dynamics of labor that have been established in Northeastern Brazil, taking into account especially the socioeconomic reconfiguration brought by the creation of the Superintendence for the Development of the Northeast (Sudene) in the late 1950s. The article is motivated by the resumption, over the last decade, of an agenda of large public-private projects in the country and in the region. We seek here, from a retrospective viewpoint, to improve the understanding of the current situation and its possibilities and tendencies regarding development patterns and the corresponding labor relations.

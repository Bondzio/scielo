This work examines the process of implementing the federal programs Kit Tecnol√≥gico [Technology Kit] and TV Escola [TV School], explaining in a succinct way the main results of a recent study to evaluate the implementation process on the national level. The recent introduction of educational extension systems into Brazilian public municipal and state networks offers an excellent opportunity to study factors that are obstacles to their full functioning, and to identify those factors that in the real situation of our schools have facilitated the use of didactic films and how they appear advantageous to those who potentially use or benefit from them - and for this same reason can help with and facilitate their introduction.

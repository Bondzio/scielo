AbstractThis article assesses the outcome of the initial public offering (IPO) of the Minas Gerais Sanitation Company Companhia de Saneamento de Minas Gerais in relation to its water supply and sewage services. Exploratory and inferential statistical methods are used to analyze indicators based on official data. Information obtained through semi-structured interviews with managers, experts and specialists on this topic is also considered. The study concludes that the experience under analysis is similar to other cases reported in the national and international literature. Results obtained by the Company did not justify a change in the management model. Although the Company is still under public control, the changes observed during this period are more in line with the interests of the market and are often in opposition to the needs of the population.

ABSTRACT The researcher Sibel Erduran gave us a brief interview and shared her ideas about Science Education research. We talked about the theoretical choices she made, to develop the model of the Nature of Science that she used in her recent studies; the contribution of several research topics to the production of knowledge about Science Education; and, her thoughts concerning the different research methodologies used in Science Education. We discussed the researcher&#8217;s opinions about the consequences of maintaining traditional strategies in Science Education, and what attitudes could be adopted by researchers and teachers to reduce the gap between research and practice in Science Education.

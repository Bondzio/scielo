Hegel's theoretical concerns during his formation period were linked to Aufkl&#228;rung, to the relations between reason and religion and to political-ethical facts, referred to public life in classical Greece and the historical transformations in Europe related to the French Revolution. The multiple relations and implications of these theorical concerns implied the links between history and religion. The Hegel's thought about esthetics was originated from the same links like his conceptions of art. In the same way art for Hegel appeared as a perfect manifestation of the relation between history and religion.

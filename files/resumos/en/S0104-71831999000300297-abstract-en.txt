Only &#8220;impressions&#8221; is what this text, which has no scientific pretensions, intends to give to any possible reader of the rich experience and the thoughts originated from the author&#8217;s observations of the life in a Russian city, and of the country as well. Russia is a fascinating place, a living laboratory, where all the transformations of a complex past led to the construction of a historical present. This text should not be considered as a roll of definite concepts rather than a suggestion to provide a debate about them.

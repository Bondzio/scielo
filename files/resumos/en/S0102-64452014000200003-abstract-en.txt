This article explains that crisis and reform are two usual topics in the last three decades of the World Health Organization work. After briefly introducing the organization, the crisis main characteristics are identified by literature review and documentary analysis. Subsequently, results from empirical research on the reform agenda in the World Health Assembly sessions from 1998 to 2014 are listed. A short mention to Brazil's and Union of South American Nations' positions regarding the organization reform is also introduced. On the conclusion, a deliberation upon the possibility of WHO becoming, due to the ongoing reform, a "cosmopolitan enclave" in the complex global health framework is proposed.

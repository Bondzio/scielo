Agroenergetic Policies for the production of biofuels is presented under the assumptions of sustainable development. The ethanol fuel, produced from sugarcane, appears as a more viable alternative, which stimulates growth of new processes and spatial distribution of the sugarcane production. Goiás state is one of the main routes of expansion of the sugarcane. This article aims to understand the contradictions of the social issues within the official discourse of the National Plan of Agroenergy and the impacts associated with the expansion of sugarcane monoculture in regions of predominance of family farming. The development of the theme is based on a case study, conducted in Itapuranga city (Goiás state), using a qualitative approach and combining the techniques of literature search, observation and interviews. It was found that these policies helped to transform the social context of Itapuranga and cause considerable changes in the organizational dynamics of family farmers.

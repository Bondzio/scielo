Abstract The conference of Theodor W. Adorno on the concept and practice of "free time", published in Stichworte (1969), was delivered at a time of full employment. The gradual reduction of the normal working hours which suggested and consolidated a long-term tendency, has inspired several conjectures about structures hitherto regarded as inherent to the modern world. Hence, Adorno's conference-essay organizes itself both as an update and as a comment of Karl Marx's considerations about labor in capitalism. It also refers, although with less emphasis, to Max Weber's considerations that have become a bone of contention about the obsolescence or not of the "work society" paradigm.

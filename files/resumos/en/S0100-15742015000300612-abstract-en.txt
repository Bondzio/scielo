This article aims at creating a pedagogical plan for Corporal Education taking as a frame of analysis the thought of Gilles Deleuze, a philosophy that is currently relevant for contemporary pedagogies dealing with a new meaning of the body within education. The study of Gilles Deleuze's philosophy in education is conducted using the rhizome method in which conceptions of body and education are considered to be linked to what is happening, to the intensities, the power and the creative activity. From the encounter with the Deleuzian philosophy, some pedagogical paths are deduced bringing life to the thought of Corporal Education of affections, to the becoming and to creation.

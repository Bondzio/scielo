In this article the author seeks to explore some developments of the process known as the cultural and political reafricanization of Salvador, through the transitory crystalization of social figure called "brau". This would be an inflexion of masculinity informed by racial and gender tensions in Salvador, as well as a localized appropriation of cultural themes of the African Diaspora. "Braus" were (are) young blacks from poor neighborhoods who re-created a black look/corporality from readings of North-American soul culture, while being stigmatized by the middle class as violents, ugly-looking and hyper-sexed, that is, excessively black and excessively male, a hyperbole which in a way contradicts this stigmatization.

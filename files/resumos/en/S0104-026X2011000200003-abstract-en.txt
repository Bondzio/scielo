This work takes as a narrative excuse the Argentinean film XXY to discuss some aspects the film brings to the fore about the social and cultural construction of the sexual body, and how this construction has implications in the particular ways to experience the body and sexuality. The pivot of this analysis will be the concept of "stigma". The existence of this kind of film raises debate which, from a feminist perspective, has a vital meaning if we consider that filmic productions impose norms about what is possible and what is not, in this case about the constitution of a sexed subject.

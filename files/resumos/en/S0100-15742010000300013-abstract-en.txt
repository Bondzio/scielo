We observed groups of secondary school students who were challenged to conduct a research activity in physics. The objective was to distinguish collaborative engagement from other forms of group participation. We present a detailed study of lessons that occurred at the beginning of the school year in first year student classes. We used audio and video recordings to categorize the students' participation during the activity. The categories draw their inspiration from the psychoanalytical approach of Working Groups and Basic Assumptions. With the help of these concepts, it was possible to characterize individual participation in the group, paying attention to the emotional impulses that diverted individuals from the task in hand. Based on the data obtained and on other works in which we analyzed these groups in isolation, we conclude that student participation depends on intrinsic aspects of the dynamics of the learning groups. Collaboration and objectivity, which are necessary for the group to function well, depend on interference that comes from outside the group.

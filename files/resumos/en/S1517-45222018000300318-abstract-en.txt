Abstract Based on the analysis of the reception of the film Vazante in the Brazilian context, the article proposes hypotheses about new tendencies of film criticism, among which stand out: the emphasis on identity and belonging dimensions; the value of physical presence and direct participation in the debates; and the possibility of public awareness originating from the criticism field. It is argued that such directions express relevant demands for giving visibility to claims of justice and the historical inequalities, in particular to their effects on the field of cinematography. Possible dilemmas are also pointed out, especially related to aspects that based conventional criticism.

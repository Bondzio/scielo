ABSTRACT The main objective of this study is to analyze the paradox found in the relationship between work and education based on the documents of the Programa para a Avaliação Internacional das Competências dos Adultos [Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies] - PAICA - of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development - OECD. We intend to demonstrate how, historically, the multilateral organizations have been using old &#8220;tools&#8221; (programs and/or pedagogical proposals) to solve new &#8220;problems&#8221; (vocational training). Our thesis is that education has been, in general, historically transformed and minimized into a set of aptitudes and skills focused only on getting a job and, consequently, has lost its primary function in terms of human development.

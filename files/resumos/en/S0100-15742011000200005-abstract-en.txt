The main purpose of this article is to analyze the way academics in Portugal are dealing with the new conditions of knowledge production in the light of both the emergence of knowledge society/economy articulated and the Portuguese higher education increasing marketization and managerialization. These professional challenges brought by these new conditions can erode the academics' autonomy mainly built up on the scientific knowledge and collegiality. Following the results of an international survey, wich supports the empirical component of this study, the majority of the academics surveyed are still committed with the humboldtian/mertonian knowledge production principles, as the main basis to sustain their professionalism. However, they assume also hybrid positions vis-Ã -vis the epistemological categorization of their research, the links between research and teaching and the affiliation to their discipline, department and institution.

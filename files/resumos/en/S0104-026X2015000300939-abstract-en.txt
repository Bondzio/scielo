My intention is to critically describe the ways in which feminism has developed in Uruguay and the region in the last few decades. The main aim is to look at how the achievements of the movement can also be seen as failures if we take into account the cost of conflicts surrounding leadership and the loss of fresh enthusiasm since the beginning. The paper reflects upon the challenges that technological changes have introduced in regard to forms of participation in the political arena. A few points related to the feminist struggle to achieve suffrage and later participation in the womenÂ´s movement during the last dictatorship and the transition to democracy will be useful to demonstrate the contradictions and paradoxes that characterize the construction of feminisms.

Abstract I propose here to use the idea of the long duration of a movement &#8211; feminism and feminist studies &#8211; to reflect on a particular style of engagement found at the Nucleus for Gender Studies &#8211; Pagu. By reconstructing a certain history in time, I emphasize what I consider to be one of the great lessons of the feminist field of reflection: the ability for self-reflection that provokes constant repositionings in relation to the ever-changing, complex contexts in which we live.

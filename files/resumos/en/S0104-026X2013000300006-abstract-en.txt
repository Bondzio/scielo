This article aims to address a topic with little research in Brazilian social sciences: family and kinship relations of military people, in this case, inside the Army. From an ethnography performed between 2007 and 2008 at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy (Brazilian Army institution) and inside its village, it was implied that the use of the term "Military Family" is frequent among the militaries, indicating either the military contingent of the institution, or the family in its private meaning (spouse and children) or both elements together. Such definition of family revealed a very particular conception of it, suggesting its connection to sociological aspects also specifics for the military life. Based on that, this article focuses on the concepts and forms of military families and seeks to investigate the relations and configurations established between Army and family.

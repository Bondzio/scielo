Considering the Chilean education scenario in the nineties, this paper assesses public education funding policy in elementary and secundary education and its relation to the major management processes implemented during that period. It argues that the neoliberal focus characteristic of these policies implementation since 1981 still prevails. Simultaneously, neoliberalism has validated the idea that educational results are not directly associated to the social, economic and cultural capital of the families. They relate basically to the management processes of the educational establishments, with special attention to private or public ownership of the school. Moreover, this situation is related to the existence of a matrix model in the management of the Chilean educational system where the Ministry of Education does not implement policies. Municipal districts and private agents are the ones that do it. Since these ones are not required to account for their management to the Ministry in many key areas, management becomes even more complex, and consequently, also become the results of the Chilean public education system.

ABSTRACT: In order to corroborate and justify alterity as an ethical principle, this article follows the theoretical matrix of Amartya Sen, regarding the multicultural theory and of Emmanuel Levinas, concerning the theory of alterity. First, it approaches the principle of alterity via the concept of justice in its origin based on the criteria of incomparability, dynamic identity and third party. Second, it argues that the concretization of justice occurs from the senses of proximity and responsibility, as a principle and characteristic of the initial interpersonal relationship. In the conclusion, the article discusses some directions and challenges that the principle of alterity represents for education, emphasizing ethical formation, sensitivity, reasonableness and fecundity.

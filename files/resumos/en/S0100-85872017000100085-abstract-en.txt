Abstract This article proposes an analysis of the role of sexuality in Wicca&#8217;s practices. Wicca is a contemporary pagan religion that arose in England between 1940 and 1950. Nowadays, it is a multifaceted global movement, which follows several strands. This research investigates conceptions and practices related to sexuality among Brazilian Wicca groups who practice this religion publicly in various Brazilian cities. They organize themselves in closed groups, the traditions, who command civil associations. Those associations aim to protect rights and promoting public events for dissemination and exchange of knowledge among religious practitioners. The research results show that Wicca posits an intrinsic relationship between sexuality, spirituality and freedom. Their sources belong from various intellectual movements such as esotericism, the counterculture and Eastern philosophy.

To repeat the year does not help students with difficulties. Several studies about the effects of grade repetition show that in general students who do poorly and start again the same school year progress less than weak students who are promoted. Which pedagogical measures are necessary to combat school failure? The aim of this article is to review what empirical studies reveal about the most often mentioned procedures as a means to attain pedagogical improvement. The first procedures relate to the composition and management of homogeneous and heterogeneous groups, small or big classes, and groups of students with specific needs; the second procedures relate to the learning individualization devices or to the opposite strategy of cooperative and tutorial learning; the third procedures relate to the formative evaluations, either followed or not by corrective actions. When discussing the results, the author defends to redirect the pedagogical studies so as to investigate primarily the most generic procedures, leaving for the most extreme cases the mobilization of devices based on a fine diagnosis of the learning difficulties.

Abstract This theoretical and conceptual research highlights contemporary authors, issues and debates related to food through a political-cultural perspective. The analysis of the different studies here mobilized made possible to define five research topics involving food, culture and society. These issues require an interdisciplinary dialogue among different areas, in order to contribute to building a more creative and permeable perspective on food in line with the contemporary social debates.

Abstract: The purpose of this work is to analyze the ways in which abject subjectivities (described here as border identities) defy the historic, politic, bourgeois, catholic and heterosexual order &#8211; which has shaped Hispanic collective identity during the twentieth century, strongly influenced by Franco&#8217;s dictatorship &#8211; , in the novels El beso del cosaco, by Eduardo Mendicutti, and Malditos, by Luis Antonio de Villena, and the films La ley del deseo and La mala educación, by Pedro Almodóvar. This works question the parameters of Hispanic normality by presenting a tension between the self and the others, which is also related to the problem of the intelligibility of the sexual gender within the representations and definitions of social life that shape the collective and identity imaginaries.

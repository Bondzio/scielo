Abstract: This paper contains some reflections concerning notions and meanings on money circulation in a specific locality. The results I present are based on an ongoing research focused on savings and investment in daily life. I explore different logics that run alongside money flows, valuations and perceptions regarding their dynamics. Ultimately, this relates to what the subjects understand as economic situation and speed in the movement of money. I have carried out an ethnographic exercise and have implemented participant observation, keeping detailed records in diaries, as well as open interviews. The fieldwork site is San Miguel de Cuarenta, a village in the municipality of Lagos de Moreno in Jalisco MÃ©xico.

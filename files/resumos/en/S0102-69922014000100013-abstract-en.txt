This paper looks for a critical dialogue with decolonial/post-colonial studies and specially some of its main theses. It is necessary to deepen the epistemological critique. But we must achieve this development without losing theoretical and conceptual precision as well as we must take into account the global relationship between theory and anti-colonial politics. This paper also shows how the concept of internationalism, the imperialism theory and segmentarity concept can help us with these tasks.

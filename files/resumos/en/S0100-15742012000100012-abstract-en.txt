This article examines some of the usages of the concept of the pedagogical project, applied to public school; its meaning and the conditions of maximizing its use. In the implementation of the pedagogic project itself, some aspects can help public schools to overcome its difficulties in this task. First, it mustn't be understood as another written document, merely descriptive of general objectives and methods of teaching. On the contrary, the pedagogical project can provide a peculiar school atmosphere, one offered by the work of institutional actors, when collectively organized in the school. Moreover, it can stimulate the understanding and the discussion of the main principle that rules the citizen formation. So, the pedagogical project renders explicit some inseparable features, required to define and to implement a good quality in education, from concrete practices in which every public school can, consistently, fulfill the role assigned to them.

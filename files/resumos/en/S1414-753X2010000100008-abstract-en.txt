The action of INCRA in the Amazon region shows a paradox: on the one hand the human occupation of that region was a strategy of the military regime, but on the other hand it is after the democratization that the agrarian reform policy intensifies the settlement of peasants in the Brazilian Amazon. The institutionalization of policies aiming at protecting the environment is contradictory with the social protection, as in the Amazon it is very much based on a model of agrarian reform that provokes deforestation.

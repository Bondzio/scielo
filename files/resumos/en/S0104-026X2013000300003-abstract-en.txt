The aim of this study is to understand the inclusion of women in computer science. We sought to understand the perceptions of teachers and teachers about the inclusion of women in this area as well as the strategies used by them to assert themselves in this environment androcentric. Methodologically, there was a qualitative exploratory study using in-depth interviews with 12 teachers in the area. It was considered the perceptions of both sexes on the phenomenon, because as said Michelle Perrot,71 one can't think of the history of women without regard to men. The results indicate that there are subtle forms of discrimination and segregation of women in the area, requiring additional effort to have them the same recognition as men.

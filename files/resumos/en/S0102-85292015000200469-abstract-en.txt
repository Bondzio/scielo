Abstract This article aims to challenge the binary logic that pervades discussions about the impact of Turkish membership on the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). It argues that any assessment of such impact must take into account existing divisions within Europe and within Turkey in terms of security culture. In order to illustrate the plurality of security cultures existent within the European Union and within Turkey and to understand the country's potential contributions to Europe as an international actor, an analysis of the EU's, some member states' and Turkey's responses to the conflict in Libya in 2011 will be provided. It will conclude that Turkey's impact on the EU's role in the world should not be overestimated. The EU is likely to continue to resemble a Humanitarian Power in the world stage, with or without Turkey.

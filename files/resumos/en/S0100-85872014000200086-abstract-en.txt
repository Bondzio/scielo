This paper analyzes the representations of young women belonging to the religious                community, Toca de Assis, on contemporary society, gender roles, and motivations for                religious adherence to a radical experience related to the care of the poor. The                empirical data contributing to discussion of the nonlinear dynamics of the                construction of religious identity and youth religious choices in contemporary                modernity. Toca de Assis expresses interesting nuances of what can be understood as a                paradox in its performance, i.e. recovering values from medieval Franciscans, the                care of the poor for instance, and innovation both in gender relations and the ways                to diffuse a religious message. The outcome from a larger study, this paper is mainly                grounded on interviews with young women members of Toca de Assis between                2009-2011.

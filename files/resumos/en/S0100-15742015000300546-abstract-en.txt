This paper presents some results of a research that discusses the processes of authorship and the aesthetic organization of the diary genre, where writing is considered an ethical and responsible act of interaction between the world of life and the world of theory. The material comprises 21 diaries written by three farmer brothers, which were examined based on the principles of Bakhtin's dialogical discourse analysis. The results of the analysis show that the aesthetics of life is inscribed in the ethical and responsible act of writing performed by the three farmer brothers and organized by authors-creators in the diaries as a genre of discourse.

The process of tecnology adoption in agriculture is fundamentally important for increasing productivity and improving the quality of agricultural products. The objective of this study is to evaluate the factors that determine the technological adoption of post-harvest coffee employed in Vi√ßosa (MG) in the year of 2007. The results indicate that the sequential model is more appropriate for the analysis and the most important determinants for the adoption of higher levels of post-harvest technology are association, profitability, training, education, credit, stock of capital, and years at school. The most important marginal effects for the adoption of higher levels of post-harvest technology are association, training, credit and profitability.

Abstract Called kif in Morocco, cannabis has undergone transformations that have impacted its social and economic value. This article observes these changes with regard to the evolution of standards, modes of use and techniques, and with regard to the evolution of the actors who manufacture and exchange cannabis, at first in a traditional context, and in a second time in two markets in the French and Spanish protectorates (1912-1956): The monopoly market and the contraband market.

ABSTRACT Several authors have highlighted the tension between university education in certain disciplines and professional insertion in the job market in general, especially regarding sociology. This study aims to analyze the way in which sociologist graduates from Universidad Nacional de Cuyo - UNCuyo -, were building their professional careers, as well as the relationship between the type of education received, their perceptions, labour practices and existing alternatives of labour insertion which they must face today. This is an exploratory study characterized by a qualitative approach. The study was carried out through biographical interviews with sociologists from several cohorts.

Abstract The last decade was marked by the rise of the international literature refers to as alternative agro-food networks (AFN), which are governed by a different logic that is opposed to the retail industry and the large supply chains regime. One of the most important experiences of European AFN is the Friendly Campaign Project, carried out by the main Italian agricultural trade union confederation (Coldiretti). Since its inception in 2009, the emphasis has been towards rebuilding relations between producers and consumers through a process of rapprochement that develops within direct sale of agri-food markets. The emphasis of this study is to show the nuances giving rise its appearance, but also the contradictions, ambiguities and challenges that social quality construction process.

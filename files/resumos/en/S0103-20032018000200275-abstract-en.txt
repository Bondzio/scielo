Abstract: The Taquary Valley is a region located in the center of Rio Grande do Sul, composed by 36 municipalities with an economy focused on the agribusiness. In this region, as in others, there are people in need, and many without access to good food habits. In order to provide at least one consistent daily meal for those who do not have access and to generate a source of income for family farmers, the Brazilian government created the Food Acquisition Program (PAA) in 2003. From this perspective, the present study made an analysis of the perception of the executive powers of the municipalities of Taquary Valley about the PAA, specifically how they decide whether to implement or not this program. Methodologically this is a quantitative and qualitative research, which used bibliographic sources, documentaries, questionnaires and interviews to satisfy the objectives proposed. At the end, the results were analyzed through statistical tools and content analysis. The research proved that the program is little used in the analyzed municipalities, mainly due to lack of knowledge about its possibilities. On the other hand, the municipalities that use it see it as a program that favors both family farmers and those in need.

Abstract Brazil actively participates in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) without having any kind of mandatory requirement. The objective of this study is to map the activities of CDM projects approved by interministerial Commission on Global Climate Change (CIMGC, for its acronym in Portuguese) and to identify new opportunities for CDM validation and verification bodies in Brazil. This paper was done by gathering information on CDM projects approved in Brazil and listed in the portal of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI, by its acronym in Portuguese). This research resulted in identifying a decrease in the registration of new CDM projects in Brazil. Furthermore, landfill projects in the waste sector has been identified to have the highest potential to be exploited in Brazil. This study also shows an opportunity to enhance the participation within voluntary carbon markets in Brazil.

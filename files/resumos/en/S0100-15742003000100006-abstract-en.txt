This study is part of a broader research project carried out in a Mexican city, which aim was to analyse how young people are prepared to cope with labour, investigating their main and varied determinations. In order to do so, public and private politics that support the preparation for juvenile work, institutions and educational systems that interfere in it, as well as the actors involved were studied. The goal of this article is to describe and to analyse three specific ways through which youngsters working in footwear industry reported that they are prepared for doing so: school education, specific and intentional formation provided within the company itself and knowledge and skills acquired in their own experience (which can be intentional or not) at the work centers. Finally, a few basic points on the subject are proposed for discussion.

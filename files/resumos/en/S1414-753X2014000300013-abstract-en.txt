Development is a complex systemic phenomenon that manifests from the relationship between multiple variables, which normally is explained at the municipal level by wealth, longevity and education dimensions, although are others, such as environmental dimension. In this context, this paper aims to determine whether the development of the counties is a convergent phenomenon between environmental performance and human development dimensions. The results of a statistical analysis based on Spearman correlation coefficient shows a lack of correlation between environmental performance and the wealth dimension of counties, and a low correlation with the dimensions longevity and education. This demonstrates, therefore, that the phenomenon of development in counties, in the period analyzed, was scattered and there was no convergence between the dimensions analyzed. This result is discussed based on the absence of clear empirical evidence of decoupling between dimensions, and due to methodological limitations of the indicators.

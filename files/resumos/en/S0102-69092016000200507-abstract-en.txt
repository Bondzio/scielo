Andr√© Gorz is known as one of the main authors in the contemporary debate on the crisis of the labor-based society. In Farewell to the working class, published in 1980, he fiercely criticizes traditional Marxism and its &#8220;religion of the proletariat&#8221;. However, Gorz&#8217;s earlier work, published in previous decades, has not been given proper attention. The aim of this article is to analyze in detail his thought of the 1960&#8217;s, showing that in those writings Gorz sustains theses that, in many aspects, are diametrically opposed to the ones upheld from Farewell to the working class onwards.

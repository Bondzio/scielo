In the last decades the deconstruction of development, also known as 'postdevelopmentalism', has grown in popularity within social sciences. In Latin America, the theoretical program called Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality (MCD) aims at decolonizing the modern thought by re-writing global history from the perspective of local histories. Arturo Escobar, one of the main theorists of the post-development paradigm, has adopted the MCD project in order to think about 'alternatives to modernity'(or trans-modernity). In this article I propose to submit the post-development and MCD programs to an empirical test. To that effect I centre on the visions and experiences of Usibamba, a community in the Central Andes of Peru. The ethnography is focused on the following question: why do usibambinos, in spite of all their negative experiences with the development apparatus, still insist on the promise of development? Does the MCD program enable us to understand the current impasse of community in Usibamba? Do concepts such as pluriverse and transmodernity enable us to understand the desires and aspirations of usibambinos? In order to respond to these queries I build upon a &#381;i&#382;ekian analysis that distinguishes between 'the actual', 'the virtual', and 'the Real'of community.

Following the Kantian tradition, in Peace through Law (1944), Hans Kelsen supported that the establishment of an international court with compulsory jurisdiction should be the first step towards the elimination of wars. Years later, Kelsen has been victorious and defeated. Although several international courts have compulsory jurisdiction, problems such as war and peace, for their complex character, still have no final solution.

The aim of this paper is to discuss teachers' conceptions of language and ways through which they organize their classroom in order to provide reading and writing. Workshops were held with teachers from public schools of SÃ£o Paulo City, Brazil. In these meetings, the attendants were free to speak about their practices and to share doubts, improvements and proposals with colleagues. The reading of literary and theoretical texts during the seminars were enriched by the teachers' own writings, movies and musical rhythms. With humor, it was tried to disconstruct words and labels which convey prejudices, restricting interactios and learning among students and their teachers in the classrooms. In addiction, letters were exchanged with students, giving birth to didatic projects that made classrooms' practices more effectives. These letters, drawings and postcards exchanged with children incentivated intelectual activities and pedagogical work.

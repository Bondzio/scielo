Abstract This article aims as systematizing data from the first reports and hooks involving populations from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, covering a period prior to the creation of the discipline of Anthropology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. Beginning with the first records by Europeans on indigenous populations, we follow up with a consideration on travel logs left by foreign visitors and, finally, the works of &#8220;local erudites&#8221;.

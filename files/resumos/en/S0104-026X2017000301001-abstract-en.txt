Abstract: The article is a Portuguese translation of an essay originally published in 1949 by black intellectual and activist Claudia Jones in Political Affairs magazine. In the essay, Jones outlines the origins and dimensions of Black women&#8217;s oppression and criticizes the inability of communists to mobilize them. In arguing that black women comprised the superexploited segment of the working class, the author centers their political militancy in the global struggle against of fascism and imperialism.

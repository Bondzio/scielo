Abstract The text addresses the differences and similarities between womanism and black feminism in the context of African American traditions. The author asserts that this debate reflects the basic challenge of welcoming the diversity of black women. But, why is it that the name given to a black women's standpoint is so important? Because the efforts to label an African American women's critical standpoint obscures much more than it reveals, since in the search for conceptual unity we lose sight of the more important challenge: understanding how the voices of black women collectively construct, affirm, and maintain a self-defined and dynamic standpoint.

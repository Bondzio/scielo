This article informs the results of a research which focus on the women's work at a small poultry slaughterhouse, in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. . The sexual division of labor and the meanings of work were supported by the social constructionism. The concept of work was understood from a double dimension: as concrete work (producing useful things) and as abstract work (producing goods). Based on a case study, a qualitative approach was developed through observation and eight interviews with women workers. Based on the analytic articulation of meanings and sexual division of labor theories, the results showed the asymmetric relations at work in the poultry industry and also in the domestic place.

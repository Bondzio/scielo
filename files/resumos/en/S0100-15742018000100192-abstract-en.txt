ABSTRACT: The aim of this study is to reflect on the role of Humanities education in the context of a cultural model in which a narrative of utility and economic profitability predominates. The main axis of this study is guided by a question: what is there to think, when thinking of the Humanities becomes a task of resistance? The development of the analysis will attempt to test the following thesis: there is a &#8220;heavy price&#8221; to pay for the gap in the study of the Humanities; this price is economic, political, civic, democratic, and anthropological. It remains to formulate the question what to do to prevent such a &#8220;heavy&#8221; price. In an attempt to answer this question, we will propose a consideration of some aspects of the way P. Ricoeur (1983, 1986, 1988, 1998, 2000) retrieves main concepts of the thought of R. Koselleck (1990).

Using Norman FaircloughÂ´s Critical Discourse Analysis, this article aims at analyzing U.S. foreign policy under George W. Bush (2001-2008). Therefore, after the reading of official documents, we intend to study the discursive construction of new threats against the United States, with particular focus on three issues: first, the construction of identities around transnational terrorism and the so-called failed states; secondly, the reception and reproduction of this discourse and how these specific meanings affected U.S. political action; and how these elements are connected to the strategies of U.S foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. Finally, concerning theoretical and methodological issues, we expect to underline the potential of Critical Discourse Analysis to the study of International Relations.

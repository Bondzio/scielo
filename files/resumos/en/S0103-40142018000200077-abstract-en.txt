Abstract The text attempts a reflection on the classroom through questions such as the beginning of a class, the relationship between program and improvisation, the place of explanation in teaching, and the problems of addressing people and loneliness in the classroom. It is the revised version of two sections of an Academic Mémoire submitted in June 2016 to the Department of Literary Theory and Comparative Literature of the University of São Paulo, as part of the requirements for applying for the position of Associate Professor. Another part of the text, identified below, was presented at the beginning of the graduate course &#8220;Questions of Literature and Ethics&#8221; in the first semester of 2016 at the University of São Paulo.

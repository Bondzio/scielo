This paper describes the theoretical and methodological aspects of a newly developed socioenvironmental research field: environmental semiotics. It is based on a field research conducted in a community from central MÃ©xico, San Pedro Cholula, Puebla. The results demonstrate how this Mexican semi-urban community faces the diverse social and environmental tensions between different linguistic fields. These tension fields are as well proposed as axis for educative reflection to foster and promote community based on self-management processes.

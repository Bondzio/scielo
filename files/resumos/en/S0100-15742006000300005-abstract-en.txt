This text intends to identify educational aspects of zero to six years old children, in the Asylum of the Displayed of São Paulo Santa Casa de Misericórdia, from 1896 up to 1950. For such, reports of the butlers of the House of the Displayed had been consulted. The text deal, initially, with the proposals for the babies and, later, with those for the three to six years old children. With regard to the babies, the most important issue was the fact that the children were no longer given to be raised by wet nurses: they remained in the nursery, which was created in 1936. In relationship to older children, the pre-school, founded in the beginning of the century, was renewed in the decade of 1940, with the arrival of professionals linked to the state board of education. The existing proposals and pedagogical conceptions of society are disclosed in the educational functions of the Asylum.

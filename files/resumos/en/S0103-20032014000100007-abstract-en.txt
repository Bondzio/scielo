This paper characterizes the farmers of Petrolina-Juazeiro Polo depending on the adoption of strategies of product diversification to mitigate a variety of risks. To that end, were collected 173 observations and an econometric model, ordered logit, was applied to identify factors that influence the probability of the producer to diversify their production. The estimation of the econometric model suggests that the main factors influencing diversification of production at the pole are: size (small farmer), experience, contracts, sales to middlemen, cultivation of main crops (banana, coconut, guava, mango and grape), association, technical assistance, certification, post-harvest care and internet access procedures. The investigation of these relations becomes relevant to the formulation of policies to encourage the adoption of management strategies to reduce risks in the region, currently concerned with the specialization of activities and the vulnerability of producers face to demand shocks.

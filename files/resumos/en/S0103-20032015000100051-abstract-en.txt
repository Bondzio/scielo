In this work we analyze the effects of the Bolsa Fam&#237;lia program on food security in Brazil, considering the food inflation from the late 2000s. The evaluation of the impact of this program was performed from the identification of the pattern of food consumption of families potentially benefited from it (using POF data), in order to check its potential purchase, considering the inflationary process cited. The data presented indicate effective action to combat hunger policy from Lula government, but it is insufficient to solve the problem of food deprivation in a structural and permanent sense: even if all the poor and extremely poor families receive the benefit of Bolsa Fam&#237;lia program, yet there would be no guarantees for Food Security.

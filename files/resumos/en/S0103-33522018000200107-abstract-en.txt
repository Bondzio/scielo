Abstract: The article focus on analyzing the senatorial election of two seats, defining its place within the great family of majoritarian systems as a kind of block vote. I investigate several pieces of electoral law across Brazilian history in an effort to describe how it was initially employed and later modified. Furthermore, I perform a preliminary analysis of electoral results in the elections of 1994, 2002 and 2010. My main conclusion is that phenomena such as the &#8220;married vote&#8221; and the subjective ordinal vote, typically present in the dynamics of such competitions for two votes, justifies treating them as entirely distinct in its strategic effects from single-member plurality rule.

Abstract From the analysis of three reports prepared by professor Ernesto Quesada, this article aims to reflect about the tensions between the most important intellectual projects in debate in Argentina in the first decades of the twentieth century: the positivist orientation (doubly claiming a theoretical and universityÂ´s organization vision) and those likened to the preservation of a &#8220;culture of the spirit&#8221; (connected to the foundational discourses of the Argentine university field). It was observed that, through the analysis of the reports, it is possible to capture a dimension of the debate that goes beyond the theoretical contentions and triggers the need for reflection on the disciplinary disputes in the university field.

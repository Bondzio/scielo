Abstract We argue that emerging powers&#8217; reluctance to conform to new norms at the global level is grounded not in rejection of norms&#8217; content, but in contestation of norms&#8217; implementation, and of the hierarchical manner in which responsibility is defined and attributed. The assessment of Brazil and India&#8217;s approach to the issue of intervention supports our argument.

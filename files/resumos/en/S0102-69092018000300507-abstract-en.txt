Starting from a critical review of the literature on the economic vote, on the one hand, and on news media coverage in electoral periods, on the other hand, we propose a study that combines the analysis of the content of journalistic texts the perceptions of media consumers. Our analysis combines the emission and the reception of news content. We propose the hypothesis that the framework (with notions of valence and accountability of events) printed by the vehicle in its coverage is associated with the reader / voter&#8217;s perception of the economy and the performance of the federal government. First, it was conducted a quantitative analysis of the economic and federal government framework in the news published by Folha de S. Paulo, O Estado de S. Paulo, O Globo and Jornal Nacional, from August to October 2014. Next, we selected data on perceptions of the state of the economic and the Federal Government of consumers of these media during the same period. Applying multinomial logistic models,and using government satisfaction and economy valuation as dependent variables, we conclude that that being an audience of Jornal Nacional and being a reader of O Globo reduce the chances of evaluating the economy well, but do not directly impact the evaluation of the Federal Government, while being a Folha de S. Paulo reader does not alter the chances of evaluating the economy and the Federal Government.

This article contrasts some works by Karl Marx with Hannah Arendt's The Human Condition. This comparison aims at examining Arendt's approach to the category labor in contrast to that adopted by Marx. To this end, a theoretical-analytical study was conducted on the conceptual treatment given by these authors to the category in their respective works. The study allowed to conclude that Arendt did not fully comprehend the double dimension - philosophic and economic - given by Marx to the category labor. Nevertheless, she brought new arguments to the debate about the importance of work in the modern world.

Abstract The international activity of subnational actors in what is understood as paradiplomacy has been a recurrent phenomenon since the 1990s. This underscores the international projection of interests hitherto contained in the scope of national agendas and reverberates in the dynamics of co-operation projects among countries. Such processes deserve therefore to be rethought in theoretical and conceptual terms. This paper deals with possible changes in the dynamics of regional integration in the light of the transformations that have made possible the growth of paradiplomacy and the prominence of subnational actors in the international sphere. First there is a discussion about the concepts of paradiplomacy and regional integration, and questions are raised related to the need for observing paradiplomacy from the perspective of the integrationist dynamics of a region. Subsequently, there is an analysis of the possibilities for understanding the processes of integration incorporating paradiplomacy as one of their constitutive resources.

Abstract This article analyzes the National Policy of Social Participation, launched via Decree N. 8243/2014, in order to map their innovations, limitations and capabilities to meet the challenges of the effectiveness of social participation in the country. Its proposals will be contrasted from four dimensions of effectiveness, which, I argue, have guided the academic debate on the experiences of interaction between state and society: participation and deliberation, representation, implementation and articulation. Despite the large limits of the Policy, the paper concludes that the NPSP focuses on the four dimensions presented, but the dilemmas of implementation and articulation of participatory institutions with different state arenas are superficially treated. The difficulty of dealing with these issues and the conflicts around the Policy approval process show that social participation in Brazil remains dependent of the nuanced understanding that each government has on the role of the State-society interactions.

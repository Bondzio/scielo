Abstract Walking ethnography studies are increasingly present in the literature on the numerous mobility methodologies found in the social sciences and humanities that potentially expand our phenomenological interpretations of the embodied and emplaced dimensions of lived experience. In this study, the mobile investigations as ontologically and epistemologically co-generative in the embodied production of aesthetic meaning-making in nature were examined, aiming to comprehend relations with the human and more than human world and reflect on the potentialities and limits of this methodology in phenomenological research and practices in environmental education. Moreover, the process of (non) representation of these experiences has been problematized insofar as they are not restricted to language, but are essentially bodily and involve multiple dimensions and connections, simultaneously with the human world and the materialities of the more than human world.

Abstract The Iranian Nuclear Program in recent years has generated much controversy in the international community, and the State of Israel is one major opponents of the program. That said, the article seeks to analyze how the process of delegitimization of this Iranian national policy within the discourses of the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu occurs. As a theoretical framework, we will employ postmodernist concepts of identity, security foreign policy as advocated by Campbell (1992) and Hansen (2006). In parallel we will use the methodologies from the Critical Discourse Analysis of Thompson (2007) and Reyes (2006; 2008; 2011). We conclude that the representation of peaceful Israeli identity as opposed to a threatening Iranian identity is the main shaft to the delegitimization of the Iranian Nuclear Program.

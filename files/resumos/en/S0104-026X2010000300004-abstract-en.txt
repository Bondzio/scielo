This article begins by presenting the current status and trends of the presence of women in positions of political responsibility in international, national and regional parliaments in Spain). Specifically, it examines the case of Asturias, where in addition to acknowledging the considerable increase in the number of women in parliament, we identify two problem areas for achieving the empowerment of women. We will refer to this as a process that goes beyond the access of women to decision-making positions; it means also that women are aware of their capabilities, skills, and competence to influence the political field. For this reason, it was considered interesting to assess, on the one hand, the difficulty that both structurally and emotionally argues that women because "the triple working day", which limits equal access to this world and for the negative influence that stereotypes have on women moderating the process of self, selfesteem, and competence in carrying out the political role. It is presumed that both approaches in some way explain the phenomenon of slow progress in the process of empowerment of women. For this purpose, we have used both quantitative data about the presence of women in political positions and discussion groups, formed by members of different political parties and individuals who occupy parliamentary, government, and administrative positions in the Principality of Asturias

Abstract One of the longstanding problems in anthropology of Afro-Brazilian religions is related to their presence and existential possibilities in the fast growing cities, understood as a sign of national modernization. Along this paper I sketch out contemporary dynamics between afro-brazilian religions, Estate and Society, having the southern city of Guaiba, nearby Porto Alegre - RS, as a background. To do so I take at stake the history and development of the project &#8220;Ajeun Ilerá - Healthy Food for Everyone&#8221; (author´s translation), structured by the initiative of Assobecaty - Beneficent Cultural Africanist Association Temple of Yemanjá -, as a way to map out how State and religion work together on the shaping of contemporary cities, public spaces, and religious and political (id)entities.

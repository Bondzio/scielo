Filmmaker Tereza Trautman's work was crossed by the emergency of emancipation and equality for women vindications, mainly in the 70's. While Brazilian military government and its censorship organism tried to moralize society and to keep women in their private role traditionally established, Tereza Trautman took the camera and sought to create new representations for them into the cinema. In a radical way, her work acquired agency, questioning in an irreversible way women's place, in the purpose of a new society. The censorship scissor crossed definitely her carrier and the director saw, one by one, her professional projects sinking down. Os homens que eu tive, her more polemic film, is in the main stream of this interview, which opens a space to a narrative that is also an outflow of a women's generation which looked for professional survival and expression strategies during the Brazilian dictatorship years.

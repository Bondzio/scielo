Abstract This article aims to construct a typology of valor based on the comprehensive sociology of Weber, Simmel, and Elias. Valor is considered an evaluative choice by individuals inclined to lead a life of adventure and convinced of the legitimacy of a lifestyle based on the proximity to violence, death, and risk. Even with the advent of modernity, and the emergence of the &#8220;civilizing process&#8221; - responsible for curbing violent instincts -, bravery, restricted in everyday life, remains active as a legitimate social value.

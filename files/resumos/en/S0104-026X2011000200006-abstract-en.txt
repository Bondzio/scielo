In this article, we present a discussion about the use of the heart as an important allegorical element of recognition of a collective identity in Latin America. The work of Astrid Hadad, a Mexican performer-cabaretera, of Maya-Lebanese origin, points to the criticism of a control policy that organizes gender models in Mexico. The experience of colonization in Latin America was guided by discursive strategies which employed the heart as an important allegory of subordination, especially that of women. In her video clip Coraz√≥n Sangrante, using the linguistic strategies of the melodrama, Hadad uses the ambiguity of irony to approach this issue, pointing to colonial marks in the contemporary Mexican culture.

Abstract The article discusses the contributions of the Frankfurt School to the debate on culture within capitalism. Certain writings of Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno and Herbert Marcuse are analyzed, which, with their peculiarities and nuances, share a general diagnosis about the functioning of culture in late capitalism. The guiding thread of the article is to examine how culture is investigated by these authors as an indispensable sphere for the expanded reproduction of capitalist relations, inasmuch as it establishes itself as a privileged instance of socialization and subjectivation, especially after World War II.

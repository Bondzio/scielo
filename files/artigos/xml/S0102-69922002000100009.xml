<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><B>Introduction</B></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Starting in 1995 and accelerating to a peak in    the Spring of Year 2000, Manhattan had many more construction sites than usual.    But although these new construction sites had subcontractors, they had no cement;    they had architects, but no steel; they had engineers and designers and builders    who built for retail firms, financial services, museums, government, and cultural    institutions, but no one ever set foot into their constructions. These architects    were information architects, the engineers were software and systems engineers,    the designers were interactive designers, and the builders were site builders    - all working in the Internet consulting firms that were the construction companies    for the digital real estate boom that marks the turn of the millennium. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the Spring of 1999 through the Spring of    2001, we were fortunate to be able to observe one of these startup firms and    watch its website construction projects, not through a plexiglass peephole,    but close-up as ethnographic researchers. What we found, in almost every aspect,    was a project perpetually "under construction". At the same time that    the software engineers and interactive designers were constructing websites,    they were also constructing the firm and the project form. And this relentless    redesign of the organization was occurring simultaneously with the construction,    emergence, consolidation, dissipation, and reconfiguration of the industry itself.    "What is New Media?" This was the question we encountered numerous    times scribbled on whiteboards in brainstorming sessions during or just prior    to our meetings in various interactive companies. Or, as one of our informants    posed the question: "People are always trying to come up with a metaphor    for a website. Is it a magazine, a newspaper, a TV commercial, a community?    Is it a store? You know, it's none of these&#133; and its all of these and others,    in many variations and combinations. So, there's endless debate". Of one    thing you could be certain: if you were sure you knew the answer, the pace of    organizational innovation to make new business models, the pace of technological    innovation to make new affordances, and the pace of genre innovation to make    new conceptualizations had likely combined to make your answer already obsolete.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What is a new media firm? In answering the question,    the startups did not start from scratch. The form of the firm and the shape    of projects were borrowed from prior existing models. Many were shaped around    the consulting firm model; others adopted the model of an architectural firm,    an advertising agency, a film or television studio, a software engineering or    systems integration company, a design studio, a venture capital firm, or the    editorial model of a magazine. Forming the basic template, these models were    repurposed for new functionalities as well as recombined for new purposes (e.g.,    consulting model + systems integrator, media production studio + venture capital    model, etc.). </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But whatever the choice of model (and note that,    with few exceptions, most firms studiously avoided the "construction company"    moniker), every new media firm that was in the business of constructing websites    had to cope not only with the problem that the field was in flux but also that    every successful innovation in carving a niche, creating a new product, defining    a new business model, or introducing a new technology could be replicated by    competitors. Unlike other high tech firms in fields such as biotechnology where    patents could protect intellectual property, in the new media field innovations    were not likely to yield a stream of rents. Under circumstances of low barriers    to entry (because innovations - in genre, technology, and organization - could    be easily imitatedassimilated), firms were forced to be relentlessly innovative.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus, firms could not prosper simply by learning    from their construction projects. It was not enough to master the project form,    to codify, routinize, or even perfect what they had been doing. If you locked-in    to what you had done previously, regardless of how much you improved performance    by your existing criterion, you would be locked out of markets that were changing    rapidly. On the other side, if you spent all your organizational resources searching    for new products and processes, always and everywhere exploring for new opportunities,    you would never be able to exploit your existing knowledge. For the new media    companies, March's (1991) problem of "exploration versus exploitation"    could be rephrased as the problem of staying ahead of the curve without getting    behind on your deadlines. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When coping with complex foresight horizons (Lane    and Maxfield, 1996), where dislocations can be anticipated in general but are    unpredictable in their specific contours, we find firms perpetually poised to    pursue innovation. They build organizations that are not only capable of learning    but also capable of suspending accepted knowledge and established procedures    to redraw cognitive categories and reconfigure relational boundaries - both    at the level of the products and services produced by the firm and at the level    of the working practices and production processes within the firm. Our attention    it drawn to organizations that innovate in ways that allow them to re-cognize,    redefine, recombine, and redeploy resources for further innovation. In other    words, these organizations "invest in forms" (Thevenot, 1984) that    allow for easy reconfiguration and hence minimize the costs of "divestment"    or reorganization. Such capacities for organizational innovation go beyond the    discovery of new means to carry out existing functions more effectively and    efficiently. Under conditions of radical uncertainty, organizations that simply    improve their <I>adaptive</I> fit to the current environment risk sacrificing    <I>adaptability</I> in subsequent dislocations (Grabher, 1997; Grabher and Stark,    1997). </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Organizational ecologists have long held that    adaptability is promoted by the diversity of organizations within a population.    The perspective adopted here, by contrast, is that adaptability is promoted    by the <I>organization of diversity </I>within an enterprise. The adaptive potential    of organizational diversity may be most fully realized when different organizational    principles co-exist in an active rivalry within the firm. By rivalry, we do    not refer to competing camps and factions, but to coexisting logics and frames    of action. The organization of diversity is an active and sustained engagement    in which there is more than one way to organize, label, interpret, and evaluate    the same or similar activity. Rivalry fosters cross-fertilization. It increases    the possibilities of long-term adaptability by better search - "better"    because the complexity that it promotes and the lack of simple coherence that    it tolerates increase the diversity of options. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We explore these themes by examining the collaborative    interactions among the multi-disciplinary project teams working in a Silicon    Alley new media firm. First, we establish the highly uncertain environment within    which new media firms operate, with the paramount uncertainty being the shifting    content, parameters, and value of the new media industry itself. What is the    meaning and where is the value of new media? We then sketch the organizational    features required of new media firms to deftly reassess the shifting terrain    and adjust their positioning and strategy. Most salient among these features    is the organization of diversity through lateral accountability, properties    constitutive of a new mode of organizing that we characterize as heterarchy.    We then explore the dynamics of heterarchical organization by examining the    process of collaborative engineering involved in the construction of websites.    Prominence given to the competing evaluative and performance criteria specific    to the multiple disciplines is matched by a scaling back of administrative hierarchy.    In place of directives, the multiple disciplines engage in a discursive pragmatics    in which the disciplined judgement needed to do a good job is balanced with    compromise needed to get the job done. Sharing the responsibility for getting    the work done, one fights to promote the values of one's discipline, but one    yields out of allegiance to the project and the firm. By distributing authority,    the firm yields control of disciplined argument but wins the competitive edge    that results by cultivating a diversity of options in face of uncertainty. </font></p>      ]]></body>

But it is also, and just as importantly, <I>a social/industrial    space</I> between Wall Street and Midtown, linking the financial district to    the traditional big advertising firms and the traditional big media companies    in broadcast and publishing. In this case, the physical place and the social    space are, not coincidentally, isomorphic. By 1999, new media was one of New    York's fastest growing sectors with almost 100,000 full-time equivalent employees    in Manhattan alone (that is, more than the city's traditional publishing and    traditional advertising industries combined) and with an estimated 8,500 new    media companies in the larger New York City area. In that same year, the New    York new media industry produced revenues of $16.8 billion and generated $1.5    billion in venture capital funding and $3.5 billion in IPO funding (New York    New Media Association, 2000). </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bolstered by industry associations, promoted    by government officials, and exhuberantly championed by its trade publications,    the public face of these new media companies showed a brash self-confidence.    But they were acutely aware that they were operating in a highly uncertain environment.    Their statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) upon filing    for a Initial Public Offering (IPO) provide a chorus of this uncertainty. (All    statements in bold or italics are quotations from SEC filings by Silicon Alley    new media firms.) </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the risk factors reported by these new    media firms are some standard items commonly found in almost all SEC filings.    More interesting are those factors common to early stage companies in which    the elapsed time from start-up to IPO is brief<I>:</I> </font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1) We have an extremely limited operating history      and may face difficulties encountered by early stage companies in new and      rapidly evolving markets. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2) Our recent growth has strained our managerial      and operational resources </font></p>  </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For some new media firms, the liabilities of    newness were extreme, as in this case where almost all the senior personnel    were newcomers to the company: </font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">3) Several members of senior management have      only recently joined the company </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Several members of our senior management joined      us in 1998 and 1999, &#91;this from a March 1999 filing&#93; including our Chief Financial      Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Senior Vice President for Sponsorship, General      Counsel, Vice President for Finance, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer,      Senior Vice President for Human Resources, and the Chief Technology Officer.      These individuals have not previously worked together and are becoming integrated      as a management team. </font></p>  </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a tight labor market, loss of "old hands"    is a real threat and, in this knowledge-based industry, would spell a loss of    the company's primary assets, especially where contacts to clients are contacts    through personnel: </font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">4) The loss of our professionals would make      it difficult to complete existing projects and bid for new projects, which      could adversely affect our business and results of operations. </font></p>  </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moreover, assets are not contained within the    boundaries of the firm but are distributed across a network of interdependent    firms.

For example, we rely on &#91;another Internet      company's&#93; software for the placement of advertisements and &#91;another Internet      company&#93; for personal home pages and e-mail. Several of the third parties      that provide software and services to us have a limited operating history,      have relatively immature technology and are themselves dependent on reliable      delivery of services from others. </font></p>        ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">6) Our market is characterized by rapidly changing      technologies, frequent new product and service introductions, evolving industry      standards, and changing customer demands. The recent growth of the Internet      and intense competition in our industry exacerbate these market characteristics.      </font></p>  </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a newly emerging field, measuring assets is    also complicated by the absence of industry standards and by uncertain government    regulations: </font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">7) The market for Internet advertising is uncertain.      </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are currently no standards for the measurement      of the effectiveness of Internet advertising, and the industry may need to      develop standard measurements to support and promote Internet advertising      as a significant advertising medium. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">8) Government regulation and legal uncertainties      could add additional costs to doing business on the Internet. </font></p>  </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Being a frontrunner in an emerging field is only    a temporary advantage where there are few barriers to entry, no patentable rents,    and larger and more established firms ready to exploit the profitable activities    revealed by the trials and errors of the pioneering startups: </font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">9) We compete in a new and highly competitive      market that has low barriers to entry. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">10) We do not own any patented technology that      precludes or inhibits competitors from entering the information technology      services market. </font></p>        ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">11) We expect competition to intensify as the      market evolves. We compete with: Internet service firms; technology consulting      firms; technology integrators; strategic consulting firms; and in-house information      technology, marketing and design departments of our potential clients. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">12) Many of our competitors have longer operating      histories, larger client bases, longer relationships with clients, greater      brand or name recognition and significantly greater financial, technical,      marketing and public relations resources than we have. </font></p>  </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Above all, will e-commerce prove viable?

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our litany of risk factors in the Silicon Alley    IPO filing statements points to the difficulties of evaluating Internet stocks.    But over and above the problem of the market figuring out what these firms are    worth is an even more interesting uncertainty: how do the firms themselves figure    out what is <I>the basis of their worth?</I> To be clear, the problem is not    in establishing the level of their market capitalization, which in any case    is set by the market, but of surveying their actual and potential activities    to discover what they are doing (or could be doing) that is of value. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many of the Silicon Alley new media firms that    were formed during the initial expansion of the Web around 1995 began their    operations designing websites. Suddenly, every corporation, it seemed needed    a website. This surge in demand for the skills of designers and programmers    created a sizeable niche, with relatively few players, and a yawning knowledge    gap between producers and clients. The folk history of the industry is strownlittered    with stories by the start-up entrepreneurs who tell of their early experiences    with mid-level corporate managers who had never surfed the Web but who had been    instructed by senior executives of major corporations to "get us a website!"    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many of the twenty-something new media pioneers    were rebounding from a string of marginal jobs, having graduated from college    after the '87 stock market crash and the following recession that devastated    the New York City economy. With the sudden expansion of the Web, their generational    position, which had seemed such a liability, now became an asset: having grown    up in the computer age, they were quick to grasp the implications of the Web.    Equipped with a couple of PCs, an Internet connection, and the rudiments of    HTML they could make some kind of living, doing something they enjoyed, while    making up the rules as they went along (Kait and Weiss, 2001). Here was an opportunity    to prove their worth - in circumstances where their marginality to the corporate    world could be recast into a source of authority as legitimate interpreters    of an alternative medium. With nothing to lose and with little or no experience    in the corporate world, they met corporate executives who had little or no experience    in the emerging field of new media. Frequently negotiating in their apartments-qua-offices,    the six figure contracts they landed for building websites were instant proof    (sometimes surprising in magnitude) of their value. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If the corporate world was not only paying attention    but also willing to pay, what was it paying for? In these early days, their    corporate clients were anxious to establish a presence on the web, imagining    websites as little more than billboards alongside the information superhighway.    But, as the new media entrepreneurs were introduced to the business operations    of the firms, their interactions with various units yielded new insights about    the capabilities of interactive websites as innovative corporate tools. Looking    inside marketing departments, they realized that the web could provide new kinds    of information about customers; in interactions with production departments,    they learned that the web could establish new kinds of relationships to suppliers;    and probing technology departments they recognized how the web could exponentially    extended the network of information transfer well beyond the task of integrating    proprietary data. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although they were being paid for design work,    the new entrepreneurs concluded that the real value they brought to the deal    and to the client was as consultants. And so they adjusted their positioning.    As "web shops" they were like construction companies, building in    a digital medium to be sure, but nonetheless basically working to the specifications    of the client. Reconfigured as "web developers," they were in the    business of advising clients about how to develop an overall strategy on and    for the web. The new mottos and redesigned logos on their own websites told    the story: "Interactive Strategy", for example, and "digital.change.management".    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new management consulting/web design hybrid    took the web developers more deeply and more intensively inside the organizations    of their corporate clients (as the price of a well-designed corporate website    rose into seven figures). And this increased interaction brought them into new    fields with yet different identities. Their increased interaction with marketing    departments, for example, resulted in "interactive advertising" and    brought them onto the domain of the midtown advertising agencies. As they began    to design intranets and virtual offices for flexible communication within the    corporation, the web developers learned that their programming skills in graphic    design had to be augmented with programming skills for the "information    architecture" of knowledge management. And with the development of e-commerce,    the front end of the website (the interface with the customer) quickly became    more integrated with the entire organization and its "legacy systems"    working on older operating platforms in production, purchasing, billing, and    data archiving. To deliver a comprehensive product that linked the user interface    to the "back end," the graphic designers, thus, also found themselves    moving onto the terrain of the system integrators. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so from graphic designers the web developers    had evolved into interactive designers/ management consultants/ advertising    agencies/ information architects/ system integrators. Some of them were now    being approached by a new kind of client - not simply major corporations who    needed a website to augment their bricks and mortar facilities but also start-up    entrepreneurs with no physical plant and equipment but ideas to build click-and-order    operations. Whereas the mid-level executives of the earlier period had come    with a corporate charge to "build me a website," the exclusively e-commerce    entrepreneurs now came with venture capital backing to "build me a company".    The entrepreneurs for galoshes.com, soapsudsonline, YouNameIt.com brought financing,    contacts to suppliers, and usually some modicum of marketing experience in athe    specific line of goods; but everything else from server farms to user interfaces,    from e-carts to returns policies, from supplier interfaces to knowledge of online    consumer buying practices rested in the knowledge base of the web developer.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After creating one or two such virtual companies    for fees, the web developers were confronted yet again with the problem of value:    why simply charge a fee for a professional service when so much of the value    of the virtual company resulted from their efforts? The answer: in addition    to fee for service, acquire partial equity in the new online companies. But    things were usually not so additive, and the resulting deals often involved    trading off some part of fees for equity. So, to protect their "investments"    in deferred fees, some web developers began incubating their client companies,    working closely with the managers of the start-up ventures to guide them to    the market. In doing so, the web developers entered yet a new field of skills.    In taking on a new project it was no longer enough to assess whether a new client    could pay its bill. As equity holders, their value as a firm now rested in part    on their ability to evaluate the potential of new ventures, their profitability,    and/or their marketability. The more they began to think of their product as    building a company, the more they had to consider the built company as a product,    i.e. the likelihood that it could be sold whether through an IPO or to another    round of investors. As such, in addition to all their other new identities,    these web developers were taking on some of the roles of venture capitalists.    Whereas the Silicon Alley new media firms were once digital construction companies,    now they joined the venerable New York City tradition of real estate developers    - developing properties on the digital landscape. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But as the web developers evolved in a zig-zag    course of learning where the value is, other actors, of course, were doing the    same. The major midtown ad agencies, for example, established interactive units    or spun off their own dedicated interactive agencies; the big consulting firms    did not leave the field of interactive management to the new media start-ups    but moved aggressively into the field; and the big systems integrators developed    their own e-commerce units and launched new initiatives in the lucrative business-to-business    (B2B) web development field. From a scarcely -populated niche, the field of    new media services was now filled with more established competitors, coming    to it from multiple starting points. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, the nascent industry was faced with    new waves of technological innovation disrupting its emerging digital ecologies.    On one side, players in the field were anticipating major breakthroughs in the    development of broadband technologies which promised the convergence in one    device of the various functionalities now parcelled across your television,    computer monitor, stereo, VCR, and telephone. But just when one might think    that this hails a new "single appliance" era, we saw, on the other    side, the proliferation of myriad electronic devices (e.g., wireless palm pilots,    and the like) through which you can receive and transmit digital information    in a mobile environment. </font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These simultaneous processes of convergence and    divergence would have two consequences. First, the joint appearance of broadband    technologies, on one side, and multi-appliance mobile interactivity, on the    other, would have important consequences for the website genre form. That is,    just at the point that the website genre seemed to be stabilizing, that moment    of stabilization was revealed as a tiny moment in the history of the medium.    Second, as bandwidth was expanding to broadband proportions, another set of    actors entered the field - cable companies, network broadcasters, recording    companies, and telecommunications firms. Sony, NBC, AT&amp;T, and Telefonica    (the Spanish telecommunications firm), for example, were among the major corporations    who moved most aggressively. They were joined, with the arrival of mobile interactivity    (from <I>Wired</I> to the "wireless revolution"), by new hardware    manufacturers such as Nokia, Ericsson, and Palm, Inc. (as well as rapidly growing    companies such as Symbol Technologies, makers of hand-held, bar-code devices).    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This crowding of the field happened at the same    time as its economic contraction. As the IPO market for dot.coms slowed and    then stopped altogether, firms that had put too many resources into developing    companies instead of developing competencies found themselves with worthless    holdings. Those who had scored early successes by tapping into the Internet    Gold Rush with a timely IPO and who had pegged their worth according to their    soaring stock values (from $12 to $120 in months or even weeks), now found (with    their shares trading in pennies) that allowing the market to be the measure    of their worth could just as easily undervalue as overvalue a company's actual    performance. Those who had turned away clients in 1998 and 1999 because "our    cultures just don't fit,", now found themselves making pitches in the most    improbable places. And those who hoped that their reputations - as capable professionals    who delivered value on deadline - would help them weather the storm now found    themselves competing for clients that were not only fewer in number but also    much more cautious about allocating resources for Internet services. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>Heterarchy</B> </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Companies striving to make headway amidst such    dizzying impermanence were in constant search of that "sweet spot"    which consisted of finding the right temporary permanence to commit to - the    winning clients, technology, marketing strategy - that would position them favorably    for the next imminent shift of course. The challenge for these companies was    not only to have the operational flexibility needed to change direction quickly;    they needed to maximize their capacity to recognize opportunities and realize    their promise, not only by exploiting their immediate benefits but by exploring    them as openings to new opportunities. To enhance their innovative capacity,    new media firms experimented with new organizational forms that we characterize    as heterarchy. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Heterarchy represents a new mode of organizing    that is neither market nor hierarchy: whereas hierarchies involve relations    of <I>dependence</I> and markets involve relations of <I>independence</I>, heterarchies    involve relations of <I>interdependence</I>. As the term suggests, heterarchies    are characterized by minimal hierarchy and by organizational heterogeneity.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Heterarchy's twinned features are a response    to the increasing complexity of the firm's foresight horizons (Lane and Maxfield,    1996) or of its "fitness landscape" (Kauffman, 1989). In relentlessly    changing organizations where, at the extreme, there is uncertainty even about    what product the firm will be producing in the near future, the strategy horizon    of the firm is unpredictable and its fitness landscape is rugged. To cope with    these uncertainties, instead of concentrating its resources for strategic planning    among a narrow set of senior executives or delegating that function to a specialized    department, firms may undergo a radical decentralization in which virtually    every unit becomes engaged in innovation. That is, in place of specialized search    routines in which some departments are dedicated to exploration, while others    are confined to exploiting existing knowledge, the functions of exploration    are generalized throughout the organization. The search for new markets, for    example, is no longer the sole province of the marketing department, if units    responsible for purchase and supply are also scouting the possibilities for    qualitatively new inputs that can open up new product lines. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These developments increase interdependencies    between divisions, departments, and work teams within the firm. But because    of the greater complexity of these feedback loops, coordination cannot be engineered,    controlled, or managed hierarchically. The results of interdependence are to    increase the autonomy of work units from central management. Yet at the same    time, more complex interdependence heightens the need for fine-grained coordination    across the increasingly autonomous units. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These pressures are magnified by dramatic changes    in the sequencing of activities within production relations. As product cycles    shorten from years to months, the race to new markets calls into question the    strict sequencing of design and execution. Because of strong first-mover advantages,    in which the first actor to introduce a new product (especially one that establishes    a new industry standard), captures inordinate market share by reaping increasing    returns, firms that wait to begin production until design is completed will    be penalized in competition. Like the production of "B movies" in    which filming begins before the script is completed, successful strategies integrate    conception and execution, with significant aspects of the production process    beginning even before design is finalized. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Production relations are even more radically    altered in processes analyzed by Sabel and Dorf (1998) as <I>simultaneous engineering</I>.    Conventional design is sequential, with subsystems that are presumed to be central    designed in detail first, setting the boundary conditions for the design of    lower-ranking components. In simultaneous engineering, by contrast, separate    project teams develop all the subsystems concurrently. In such concurrent design,    the various project teams engage in an ongoing mutual monitoring, as innovations    produce multiple, sometimes competing, proposals for improving the overall design.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus, increasingly rugged fitness landscapes    yield increasingly complex interdependencies that in turn yield increasingly    complex coordination challenges. Where search is no longer departmentalized    but is instead generalized and distributed throughout the organization, and    where design is no longer compartmentalized but deliberated and distributed    throughout the production process, the solution is <I>distributed authority</I>    (Powell, 1996). </font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Under circumstances of simultaneous engineering    where the very parameters of a project are subject to deliberation and change    across units, authority is no longer delegated vertically but rather emerges    laterally. As one symptom of these changes, managers socialized in an earlier    regime frequently express their puzzlement to researchers: "There's one    thing I can't figure out. Who's my boss?" Under conditions of distributed    authority, managers might still "report to" their superiors; but increasingly,    they are accountable to other work teams. Success at simultaneous engineering    thus depends on learning by mutual monitoring within relations of lateral accountability.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As it shifts from search routines to a situation    in which search is generalized, the heterarchical firm is redrawing internal    boundaries, regrouping assets, and perpetually reinventing itself. Under circumstances    of rapid technological change and volatility of products and markets, it seems    there is no one best solution. If one could be rationally chosen and resources    devoted to it alone, the benefits of its fleeting superiority would not compensate    for the costs of subsequent missed opportunities. Because managers hedge against    these uncertainties, the outcomes are hybrid forms (Sabel, 1990). Good managers    do not simply commit themselves to the array that keeps the most options open;    instead, they create an organizational space open to the perpetual redefinition    of what might constitute an option. Rather than a rational choice among a set    of known options, we find practical action fluidly redefining what the options    might be. Management becomes the art of facilitating organizations that can    reorganize themselves. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This capacity for self-redefinition is grounded    in the organizational heterogeneity that characterizes heterarchies. Heterarchies    are <I>complex</I> adaptive systems because they interweave a multiplicity of    organizing principles. The new organizational forms are heterarchical not only    because they have flattened hierarchy, but also because they are the sites of    competing and coexisting value systems. The greater interdependence of increasingly    autonomous work teams results in a proliferation of performance criteria. Distributed    authority not only implies that units will be accountable to each other, but    also that each will be held to accountings in multiple registers. The challenge    of a new media firm, for example, is to create a sufficiently common culture    to facilitate communication among the designers, business strategists, and technologists    that make up interdisciplinary teams - without suppressing the distinctive identities    of each.<a name="sup01"></a><a href="#end01"><SUP>1</SUP></a> A robust, lateral    collaboration flattens hierarchy without flattening diversity. Heterarchies    create wealth by inviting more than one way of evaluating worth. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This aspect of heterarchy builds on Frank Knight's    (1921) distinction between <I>risk</I>, where the distribution of outcomes can    be expressed in probabilistic terms, and <I>uncertainty</I>, where outcomes    are incalculable. Whereas neoclassical economics reduces all cases to risk,    Knight argued that a world of generalized probabilistic knowledge of the future    leaves no place for profit (as a particular residual revenue that is not contractualizable    because it is not susceptible to measure <I>ex ante</I>) and hence no place    for the entrepreneur. Properly speaking, the entrepreneur is not rewarded for    risk-taking but, instead, is rewarded for an ability to exploit uncertainty.    The French school of the "economics of conventions" (Boltanski and    Thevenot, 1991, 1999) demonstrate that institutions are social technologies    for transforming uncertainty into calculate problems; but they leave unexamined    the possibility of uncertainty about which institutions ("ordering of worth")    is operative in a given situation (Stark, 2000). Knight's conception of entrepreneurship    as the exploitation of uncertainty posed within the heterarchy framework is    thus rendered: Entrepreneurship is the ability to keep multiple regimes of worth    in play and to exploit the resulting ambiguity.</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><B>The firm and the project form </b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>NetKnowHow</B></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Over a two year period, we observed the organizational    features of heterarchy in practice at NetKnowHow<B>, </B>a pseudonymous new    media startup firm in Silicon Alley, such firm navigatinging the uncharted Internet.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">NetKnowHow is a full service Internet consulting    firm. It was founded in 1995 by two young entrepreneurs each with experience    in the large corporate sector (traditional consulting and traditional media).    In its formative years it was a software development company, but it quickly    moved into the new media field producing intranets and websites for corporate    and university clients. NetKnowHow acquired a reputation for excellence in retail    e-commerce after its website for a famous department store won a prize for an    outstanding e-commerce site. In 1999, while continuing to build retail e-commerce    sites for nationally recognized corporate clients, it also built sites for startup    dot.coms (striking partnerships with several of these) and merged with another    smaller startup in the field of digital kiosks. In 2000, it stopped taking on    dot.com clients, focusing instead on consulting for "click and mortar"    operations that combined physical and digital retailing while experimenting    on the side in developing applications for the wireless interface. Like the    overwhelming majority of new media startups in Silicon Alley, it had no venture    capital funding; and, also like the majority of new media firms during the period    prior to the industry's downward spiral beginning in April 2000, it was a profitable    company. Also, like almost all firms in this sector, it is struggling in the    wake of the dot.com meltdown. When we began our ethnographic research in the    spring of 1999, NetKnowHow had about 15 employees. Within eighteen months it    had grown to over a hundred employees but has subsequently declined, in three    rounds of layoffs, to about 40. Very painful, this survival is itself an accomplishment    in circumstances where much larger and much better financed companies have bit    the dust. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The physical setting of our research was in the    Flatiron District, at the core of Silicon Alley. At the point of its maximum    growth, NetKnowHow occupied four workplaces each several blocks apart - lofts    converted from displaced printing operations with as many as thirty computer    workstations in an open room where no walls, dividers, or cubicles separated    the programmers, designers, information architects, and business strategists.    It was not just open, but so closely packed that almost anyone could reach out    and literally touch someone. And, like a construction site, it was a place in    movement. Although there were periods, typically mid-morning and mid-afternoon,    where it seemed that everyone was still, each concentrating on his or her own    monitor, for much of the time the rooms seemed in motion with dozens of micro-meetings    in twos or threes, some sitting, others standing, leaning over shoulders to    point at lines of code or graphics on their monitors, some lasting 30 minutes,    many only 30 seconds. Some formal project meetings took place around large tables    in the conference rooms; but just as often, a project team would claim a part    of the open room by wheeling chairs and sitting on tables around several workstations.    For the most intense discussions, you could go to one of the "private conference    rooms" in the stairways and on the fire escape where smokers congregated.    </font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The social setting of our ethnography, like the    de rigeur hardwood floors, was Silicon Alley standard: the workforce of NetKnowHow    was tightly grouped around its median age of 27. But its demographics departed    from the typical new media startup with a higher proportion of women and a broader    ethnic and racial mix. The following job listing indicates the qualities that    NetKnowHow was seeking in its employees. For this programmer position, beyond    the obvious technical qualifications, it seeks "team players" who    "take pride in their work" and who can thrive in its "flat organizational    structure". </font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">NetKnowHow<B>, </B>Inc. seeks Cold Fusion/ASP/MS      SiteBuilder (or CGI/Perl) programmers with proven experience developing a      wide range of leading-edge Internet systems.

And like a construction    site, the place was frequently noisy - not from crane engines and jackhammers    but from the music that provided a nonstop umbrella of sound over the low hum    of many conversations. In this setting, the counterpart of a hard hat was a    headset wired to one's own music as some protection against the din and as a    signal "not to be interrupted." If the work atmosphere was casual,    the actual work was intense and the hours long. Both hours and intensity increased    with the approach of a project deadline and reached manic levels each autumn    when the hardwood floors were littered with futons and mattresses as NetKnowHow's    employees worked literally day and night to build e-commerce sites that could    be launched for the holiday buying season. Like pre-industrial work rhythms    with bouts of work followed by relative idleness (Thompson, 1982), rush work    to meet deadlines could be followed by less intense periods "between projects,"    but these were typically short. Opportunities for "learning by watching"    (Grabher, 2001) were limited where the general rule was "learning by doing"    - for there was nothing pre-industrial about the overall experience of temporality.    In the new media field, there was no sense of a "passage of time".    Instead, time was compressed; like a time-warp it was something that you were    being shot through. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>The web of a web project</B> </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The process of designing and building a website    at NetKnowHow, as in new media firms generally, takes the organizational form    of a project. A project is not a permanent construct but a temporary ensemble    whose players had been working on other projects before and will move to other    projects after its conclusion. Together with every new media firm we encountered    in Silicon Alley, NetKnowHow devotes considerable energy not simply to monitoring    projects ("building accountability of the project and in the project")    but also to monitoring the project process ("codifying our practice",    "institutionalizing our process," etc.) - in part as marketing strategy    ("The Razorfish 5 Step Process"), in part because the project form    is a critical component of the core competence of these firms. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some projects last no more than a month. Some,    whether because of their innate complexity or because of indecision or insolvency    on the client side, can last five or six months. The typically sophisticated    project runs 60-90 days, and this extraordinarily compressed time to market    is an important factor in project dynamics. Projects can bring earnings to the    firm ranging from several hundred thousand to nearly a million dollars. Project    fee structures can vary: NetKnowHow has sometimes contracted fixed fees, sometimes    adopted a retainer model, and sometimes taken equity in lieu of partially defrayed    or defered fees. More typically, it negotiates overall price estimates based    on material expenses plus billable hours. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the firm's side, the participants in a project    include business strategists, interactive designers, programmers and other technologists,    information architects (IA), and merchandising specialists. Each project has    a project manager; most projects will include a designated design lead and technology    lead, and larger projects will designate a lead information architect as well    as a lead business strategist. While they are temporarily the "members"    of project, personnel remain part of an ongoing functional unit (e.g., design,    programming, IA, strategy, etc.) variously referred to as "communities",    "disciplines", or "guilds", but most frequently called "teams"    or "groups" (e.g., "the design team", "the technology    group," etc.). </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although everyone at NetKnowHow would prefer    that people be assigned to only one project at any given time, the exigencies    of this poorly capitalized firm (and its billable hours revenue structure) frequently    require that personnel work on multiple projects simultaneously. This fact creates    time-allocation problems (and the need for cross-project cooperation) among    project managers. Moreover, it repeatedly short circuits the ongoing discussion    about the principles guiding the physical layout of the firm, specifically,    whether personnel should be spatially grouped by project or by team. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A project, of course, is a project <I>for</I>    a particular client. To an important extent it is also a project <I>with</I>    a client. In some cases, representatives of the client are a <I>part</I> of    the project. NetKnowHow's project managers and members are aware that "the    client" is itself a complex entity in which different parties have different,    and even conflicting, interests. When working with a large retail chain, for    example, the proximate "client" might be a new online unit that is    itself involved in turf wars and budget battles inside its own organization.    Similarly, the marketing department, financial services, warehousing, and production    units that are a part of "the client" can have different stakes in    the (definitions of) success or failure of the venture. Thus, when NetKnowHow's    project members (and not simply project managers) phone, e-mail, or instant    message their counterparts in the client organization for technical information    (e.g., a programmer gets in touch with a database manager in the client's "legacy"    system or a merchandizing specialist calls a marketing manager) such contacts    can also be opportunities for intelligence gathering.<a name="sup02"></a><a href="#end02"><SUP>2</SUP></a>    </font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Motivated in part by the recognition of these    complexities, some clients are hiring independent contractors who specialize    in the role of interface between the corporation and the web development project.    Thus, just at the time that NetKnowHow and its competitors are acquiring the    skills of "managing the client", their corporate clients are hiring    a new type of professional whose skills are to manage the representations of    the client (on one side) and manage the project managers (on the other). From    the vantage point of Internet companies like NetKnowHow, such developments are    a mixed blessing. The injunction that only one person speaks definitively for    the client (and a corporate "outsider" at that) can be potentially    positive because nothing can be more disastrous for a project than to operate    with erroneous or conflicting ideas of the client firm's intentions. But, at    the same time, since "the client" is likely to have multiple (and    even competing) objectives, the reduction to a single channel can result in    messages that are difficult to decipher in the absence of multiple sources of    information that make real interpretation possible. That is, mixed messages    are likely, whether from one source or many. The challenge for the project is    to construct from these mixed messages a relatively robust picture of the client,    with enough depth of focus to commit resources and yet fuzzy enough to anticipate    potential changes in direction or to facilitate quick adaptation to the unanticipated.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These interactions, whether tactically technical    or strategically organizational, are part of the web of a web project. A more    complete elaboration of the network of a web project would include: technology    "partners" (licensing and other arrangements through which the web    developer can offer access and support for new technologies); hardware and network    affilations through which the web developer offers server space, maintenance,    and network security; venture capitalists, whether brought from the side of    the client or brought to the client by the web developer; other web development    firms (when different parts of a project are distributed among different firms    or when the firm elects to subcontract parts of the project to other firms);    vendors to the client (whose information systems must be reconciled with the    categories and the functionalities of the site); order fulfillment firms, credit    services, and so on. Intelligence is distributed across this web. We turn to    the knowledge networks and lateral accountability within the project more narrowly    defined.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>Distributing intelligence: collaborative engineering    as emergent design</B> </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The life cycle of a web project typically has    a preformative, "preproject", stage of matching firm and client -    more informal in the early days of the company, later somewhat formalized in    its marketing or business development (Biz Dev) unit - followed by stages of    identifying the project personnel, a formal "kickoff", planning and    site design, production, testing, soft launch, and a celebration at hard launch.    <a href="/img/revistas/se/v17n1/a09fig01.gif">Figure 1</a> presents a diagram of a typical project    life cycle at NetKnowHow. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the idealized representation in <a href="/img/revistas/se/v17n1/a09fig01.gif">Figure    1</a>, it might seem that building a website is a matter of sequential engineering:    in principle, all design and engineering should be completed before production    begins. Within an overall sequentiality the diagram shows distinct moments of    parallel engineering, for example, during weeks 3-5 when the information architectures,    technical architects, and graphic designers work in parallel to draw up their    plans for the site which are then "handed off" to the site builders.    In the actual process, however, engineering is more simultaneous than sequential.    At NetKnowHow, website construction is a process of collaborative engineering.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An industry in which there can be extraordinary    first mover advantages creates strong pressures to be quick-to-market. The results    are excruciatingly tight project deadlines that force production to begin before    design is completed. Typically, the database managers and other programmers    begin construction just as soon as they hear initial ideas about the project.    Of course, they are not literally writing each of the many thousands of lines    of code from scratch, but are looking to previous work to find promising templates    for the various functionalities that are likely to be adopted for the project.    At the same time that they are searching through their existing stock of code,    they are also searching for solutions to the new functionalities that were discussed    in the kickoff meeting (as well as those that were not even mentioned there    but which they are literally overhearing in the close quarters of the open workplace).    If they started programming only after the information architect presented them    with the finished "wire frame"<a name="sup03"></a><a href="#end03"><SUP>3</SUP></a>    (a kind of blueprint specifying each part of the website and their inter-relations),    the project could never be completed on deadline. Similarly, the information    architect is consulting with the programmers about the code that they are already    preparing, hearing their proposals about new solutions to old problems, and    picking up new ideas that could be adopted in the site. Without such iteration,    she might draw up an exquisite wire frame - but one that could not be completed    on time and on budget. In short, production workers participate in design as    a process that involves bricolage (Stark, 1999; Garud and Karnoe, 2001). </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If production begins before design is completed,    it is also the case that design is ongoing, continuing almost to the point that    production is completed. First, even with the best efforts to manage the client's    expectations and even within a project cycle as short as 90 days, it is nearly    impossible to prevent "project creep" - the racheting up of project    specifications. Because clients learn during the process of building the site,    they will demand new functionalities. Some can be resisted ("that's not    in the project specifications"). But they cannot all be deflected, especially    when the firm has promised a "cutting edge" website and the client    now sees a competitor's site with new features that "have to be adopted".    From a narrow business logic, new functionalities can be incorporated with a    corresponding increase in price ("yes, but it will increase the programming    costs dramatically"). But from a design perspective, introducing new features    can have enormous implications that ramify throughout the site. Seemingly simple    changes in the order of steps within "check-out," for example, might    require major restructuring of the database. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But there is a second, more important, reason    why design - as the work of figuring out the whole - can continue well through    the production process, even when no additional functionalities are introduced    after the initial stages. Because of the rapid pace of organizational, technological,    and genre innovations, website construction at NetKnowHow was almost always    a process of engineering something they had not built before. Even when the    project could benefit from utilizing existing templates, the particular combinations    were likely to be novel, and likely to incorporate novel elements as well. Moreover,    at NetKnowHow, learning was by doing. That is, instead of understanding a technology    and then adopting it, one came to understand a technology by using it. As a    result, the process of figuring out how all the pieces fit together did not    take place in the initial "design" phase but, instead, occurred during    and through the process of constructing the site. "It's like a puzzle",    explained Aaron, age 27, one of the firm's two most senior project leads, "but    it's peculiar because the picture on the cover keeps changing as you put it    together". The passage from our conversation deserves quoting verbatim:    </font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Early on in the project you have a kick off      meeting and you do have an understanding of the project up front. You have      a sense of what the project is, the size of it, the scope of it, and everything      else. But as soon as that kick-off meeting is over, that whole concept just      &#133; &#91;throws up his hands&#93;. It's like a puzzle - you see the cover of the      box, you know what the puzzle is supposed to look like, you have a really      good idea of what you need to do, but then you open the box, you just see      all those pieces, and then you have to start putting all those pieces together.      </font></p>        ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In trying to figure out how the puzzle pieces      might fit together, the wireframes are not much help because the projects      are always so fluid and there are always so many changes you have to go through,      regardless. Every client wants changes; every project leader encounters some      complexity that requires a change; so the deeper you go into changes, the      farther you get from the realization. You'll have the puzzle pieces, and then      someone will dump a whole other 50 or 100 pieces into your lap. And when they      dump the additional pieces in your lap, you also don't know how those fifty      pieces relate to the cover on the box, you don't know if it's the bottom,      on the side, on the top, or the left. But you do know that what you're going      to end up with is not like the initial picture you started with at the kick-off      meeting, because you change so much. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No matter how many new changes come across,      for every new change you can tie up and get your arms around, get a resolution      to, and get it implemented, then that actually serves to be a greater step      towards the realization than just figuring out how the two pieces you had      in the beginning fit together the way that you thought they would, because      it's now more like you're getting these undefined pieces and you're able to      define them and that sort of leap frogs you toward that realization. At some      point when you get all of those changes done and a good portion of the rest      of it done and at that point, that's usually when I have that realization      that YES! I see what it is that we're doing now. I have a good understanding      of the whole thing and what it's going to end up looking like. For me it usually      happens towards the end. </font></p>  </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> In these observations, Aaron is expressing a    view that design is an emergent process, distributed across many actors in a    highly interactive way. And, like design, innovation is not a moment that occurs    at a particular stage in the web development process. At NetKnowHow, innovation    is not an activity confined to an R&amp;D department. Every unit, indeed everyone,    is involved in the process of innovation as an immensely pragmatic activity    of collaborating to "figure out how it fits together". In short, instead    of the conventional view of innovation by design, in these website construction    projects we find design by innovation. As an self-organized, emergent process,    it is not engineered from above. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To understand the complexities of "figuring    out how it fits together" we need to go beyond the simple "front end/back    end" dichotomy that figures so prominently in discussions of websites.    The distinction exists in the folk categories of the web: the "front end"    is what you, the end user, experience when you go to a website, but it's like    the tip of the iceberg; the "back end" is everything you don't see    below the water line, but which makes it work. The distinction is meaningful,    but misleading - especially if it connotes website construction as parallel    processes that have to be made to converge or leads to metaphors in which the    "front end" people (designers and such) are building a bridge from    one side, the back end people (programmers) are building from another side,    and they have to meet in the middle. Their interdependencies are, of course,    much greater. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the simple version of the front/back end model,    there are two computers and one interface: the server where the code of the    website is resident, your PC, and the graphical user interface (GUI) through    which you experience the site. But sophisticated e-commerce sites involve many    computers and multiple interfaces - yours, the servers leased by the client    of the web developer, the mainframes on which the client's multiple data bases    are operating, as well as the computers of the client's suppliers and vendors,    the computers of the order fulfillment service, credit card companies, and so    on. Your click as end user can initiate a purchase, create a delivery form,    enter a credit card payment, provide feedback to marketing, and route an order    directly to a supplier. Some sophisticated e-commerce sites reach deeply into    the production and inventory systems of multiple suppliers and use algorithms    (with weights for the suppliers' price, location, level of inventory, opening    or closing phases of production runs, and even the quality of the suppliers'    data) to determine which supplier will fill a particular customer's on-line    purchase. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The challenge for the website developers is to    build a site in which the activities of the end user are seamlessly linked to    the various other computers to which the site is interfaced. The performance    of the website critically depends on the performance of an actor - the user    - whose actions might be anticipated but cannot be controlled. It is this interdependence    that most dramatically increases the interdependencies among the website construction    crew. A programmer can design a beautiful interface between the website and    the suppliers, but she needs to make sure that it doesn't interfere with how    the information archi<STRIKE>c</STRIKE>tect is thinking about navigational issues    for the interface to the user. The more the site is truly interactive, the more    the various parts of the team must interact. A change in the categories of the    database, for example, can change parameters for the graphic designers and vice    versa. The more the intelligence of the site is distributed - including, most    critically, the user's intelligence - the more the construction site must use    a distributed intelligence among the team in collective problem solving. When    graphic designers and database programmers speak, the phrase "being on    the same page" can refer to an injunction to focus on the same problem,    a request to consider how an action will have consequences in another sphere,    an opportunity to bring each other up-to-date on new methods, applications,    functions, and reporting systems as well as quite literally being on the same    page of code. The more they must take into account how their actions will shape    the parameters of others, the more they must increase the lines of lateral accountability.    As a young programmer explained to us in an apt epigram for collaborative engineering:    "In this company, I'm accountable to everybody who counts on me."</font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><B>Organizing Diversity</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>Multiple performance criteria</B></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The directionality of accountabilities in heterarchical    organizations such as NetKnowHow is lateral. But these accountabilities are    not of a singular logic. These are sites where evaluative principles operate    in multiple registers. </font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Questions of value - the value of work and the    value of the product of work - are central to a web project. At NetKnowHow,    some criteria of worth are shared across all communities. Formal credentials    are unimportant; actual skills are critical. Not surprisingly, in this project-based    organization, an ability to work well with others is highly valued. This trait    has several components. First, an ability to get along with others in an extraordinarily    stressful and fast-pace environment.<a name="sup04"></a><a href="#end04"><SUP>4</SUP></a>    Knowing the subtle cues for when and how you can interrupt is one of the skills    relevant in this area. Second, an ability to convey knowledge (whether explicit    or tacit) to others. Finally, and most ubiquitous, an ability to figure things    out quickly. As important as (and for some even more important than) one's absolute    or relative knowledge is the rate of acquiring new skills and knowledge as well    as being talented in being able to re-think a problem so that it can be solved.    "Picking things up quickly" is highly valued whether within a community    of practice or across them.<a name="sup05"></a><a href="#end05"><SUP>5</SUP></a>    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, not all criteria of worth are shared.    The different communities of practice at NetKnowHow differ in their conceptions    of value and in their measures of performance: </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For <B>programmers</B>, a good programmer is    above all <I>logical</I>, and a good site must be judged by the same criterion.    When she performs well, she does so with <I>speed</I>, <I>efficiency</I>, and    <I>accuracy</I>; and a good website must do the same. A good programmer can    <I>translate</I> - express a functionality in the language of a computer code    that is <I>categorical </I>and <I>hierarchical</I>. A good programmer understands    the deep structure as well as the quirks and idiosyncracies of the program.    When she speaks it is not simply on behalf of other programmers but on behalf    of the program. The legitimate tests and proofs of worth are Quality Assurance    tests and other instruments that measure the speed, efficiency, security, and    reliability of the site. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For <B>designers</B>, a valuable designer must    be knowledgeable about processes of <I>perception</I>, and a good website must    use graphic cues that conform to these processes. When he performs well, he    does so with <I>creativity</I>, and the results will be <I>exciting</I> and    <I>stimulating</I>. A good designer is also a <I>translator</I> - into a language    that is <I>visual</I>, <I>intuitive</I>, and <I>interactive</I>. At work he    engages in a visual dialogue with other designers, the client, and users. When    this work of translation is successful it makes links to the <I>imagination</I>    because both the client and the user live not only in a real world and a virtual    world but also in <I>imaginary</I> worlds. The designer's translation creates    multiple links among all these - in the process, making connections between    the self-image of the client and that of the user. Exploiting interactive as    well as visual features, he creates the overall "look and feel" through    which the site achieves the desired <I>effects/affects </I>and conveys a branding    <I>experience</I>. If necessary, he has authority to argue with the client provided    he speaks as an advocate of the brand. Winning clients, winning audiences, and    winning competitions are legitimate proofs of worth. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For <B>information architects</B>, a good information    architect must be knowledgeable about principles of <I>cognition</I>. A site    that successfully applies these principles will be characterized by <I>clarity</I>,    <I>ease</I>, and above all <I>usability</I>. A good website conveys information    by creating navigable pathways that conform to cognitive pathways. An information    architect's activities are valuable because they are based on <I>studies</I>    that use statistics to understand user <I>behavior</I>. In discussions with    other members of the project, including the client, the information architect    is an advocate of the <I>user</I>. The user lives in a world of <I>information</I>    that is accessed through <I>tools</I> some of which are more and some of which    are less <I>appropriate</I> for the <I>tasks</I> that the user attempts to perform.    "Conversion rates" and other statistical metrics of user activities    are legitimate tests of a website's performance. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For <B>merchandising specialists</B>, a good    website is one that moves product. To do so, a good online merchandiser exploits    powers of <I>suggestion</I>. Because the <I>shopper</I> lives in a world of    <I>desire</I>, she is open to suggestion. <I>Playful</I>ness takes precedence    over information, surprise takes precedence over search, product <I>placement    </I>takes precedence over navigation, and <I>pleasurability </I>takes precedence    over usability. Proofs of value are metrics that measure how product is moving    in relation to inventories. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>Ok, it works, but how does it perform? </B>    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the section on collaborative engineering we    focused on the pragmatic activity of figuring out how everything fits together.    But collaborative engineering also involves the discursive activity of evaluating    how it performs. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You build a website that works. But, as more    websites get built, you cannot make a distinction between yours and others'    simply on the grounds that yours works. You say that yours performs better.    But then immediately you must begin to articulate your performance criteria.<a name="sup06"></a><a href="#end06"><SUP>6</SUP></a>    You cannot silence the talk about evaluative principles and point to a purely    pragmatic frame since your claim that you are making a valuable product raises    the question not only of what is its value but why. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The various communities of practice at NetKnowHow    were articulate and adamant about their respective performance criteria. "We    yell and scream" was a repeated refrain in conversations when we talked    about this friendly rivalry. Discussions could be heated, especially when proofs    of worth (Boltanski and Thevenot, 1991) were not immediately recognized outside    of the frames that made them seem so obvious to their proponents. The statistical    studies on user behavior produced by the leading information architect, for    example, were characterized by a leading designer as "arbitrary,"    provoking the counter-charge that this was yet another instance in which he,    the designer, was being "irrational." </font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite occasional flare-ups, the temperature    stayed cool since the dominant mode was persuasion rather than denunciation.    Because every community of practice was a minority view, each attempted to enlist    or enroll others in recognizing the legitimacy of their performance criteria.    In this process of ongoing realignment (Latour, 1986, 1991), people spoke openly    about seeking allies. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We saw this process at work, for example, in    a dispute over competing claims about who could speak on behalf of "the    user" that ranged for many months at NetKnowHow and was still ongoing when    we concluded our field work. This development was triggered by the information    architects who thought that they had a special claim on knowledge about the    user. Their hope was that every group would start focusing on the user's performance    and that by, maintaining their special definition, they could raise their own    performance criteria to a special status to which all groups gave credence.    The information architects' strategy was initi<STRIKE>t</STRIKE>ally successful:    as references to "the user" indeed circulated through the company,    we could hear this theme more and more frequently in discussions, formal and    informal. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the strategy also had consequences unintended    by the information architects: instead of deferring to the information architects,    each of the disciplines began to articulate their own definitions of the user    consistent with their value systems and metrics of performance. That is, each    community developed its own distinctive claims to represent the user. The merchandizing    specialists, who had previously seemed to be speaking on behalf of the merchandiser,    offered seminars in which they presented their view of the user as "shopper"    and mobilized an alternative set of findings. Similarly, the firm's leading    designer, who was genuinely most attentive to the studies of the information    architects, came to the defense of the designer who had derided them as "arbitrary,"    pointing out that these statistical studies were conducted at a particular stage    of the development of the web. In a variety of settings, he suggested new directions    in the evolution of the web that could make these findings obsolete. And, more    quietly but quite forcefully in their individual interactions with the other    communities, even the programmers began to articulate their own representation    of the user. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Disputes such as this were vital for firms like    NetKnowHow. If the firm locked-in to a single performance criteria, it could    not be positioned to move with flexibility as the industry changed and the web    evolved. Thus, even the principle we have not yet mentioned - profitability    - was not itself an evaluative principle that trumped all others since continuing    profitability was itself based on the ability to anticipate new developments    and re-cognize new performance criteria for evaluating well-designed and well-functioning    websites. Tolerating, even encouraging, such friendly rivalry was a source of    innovation to navigate the search for value within the young industry. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>To build a site, make settlements </B> </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Collaborative engineering is a discursive pragmatics.    It is, at once, an ongoing conversation and an intensely practical activity.    I present to you accounts of my work so that you can take my problems and goals    into account in yours. We do what works to make it work. We need to talk to    get the job done, but to get the job done we need to stop talking and get to    work. We give reasons, we explain the rationale, but we use different rationalities.    We do not end disputation so much as suspend it. To build sites, we make settlements.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Settlement of the web and settlement in web projects    share some common features, not least because the two dynamics are recursive.    As a frontier, the web is going through a process of settlement. (On settlement,    see the extraordinarily rich and insightful analysis of online newspapers by    Boczkowski 2000). It's not simply that sites are built, but that they are built    in settlements. Landscapes are reshaped and structures are recognizable by their    contours. We can distinguish an e-commerce site from a portal site from an informational    site. Things get settled. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the members of web projects, the process    of building websites has the result that things also get settled. From a very    low division of labor, some professional boundaries develop. It is possible    to recognize a graphic designer from a business strategist from an information    architect. Things settle down, people settle in. They work out ways of dividing    tasks and managing the relationships across their professional boundaries. On    many issues they reach agreement. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But you can't settle back in your ergonomic chair    too long - because, unlike settlements on physical landscapes, things don't    stay settled on the web. The built structures on the digital landscape lack    the permanence of physical structures. An abandoned warehouse is a boarded-up    blight on the landscape until it is destroyed or gentrified into luxury apartments.    An abandoned website is a Code 404, "File Not Found". Websites can    be destroyed with ease and new ones created. Repurposing takes more work,<a name="sup07"></a><a href="#end07"><SUP>7</SUP></a>    but in general the process of recombining forms takes place with marked rapidity    when working in the digital medium.<a name="sup08"></a><a href="#end08"><SUP>8</SUP></a>    Thus, just when we thought we could easily recognize the difference between    e-commerce sites, portal sites, and information sites, fusions began that confused    the distinctions. AOL's mall of affiliated storefronts began to double as a    portal, the Yahoo portal adopted e-commerce features, and we can go to the dominant    e-commerce site, Amazon, for information and for its affiliated shops. Things    might be settling down, but they are not settled. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Life in web projects is much the same. Sometimes    the parties actually come to agree. But frequently, instead of reaching an agreement,    they reach a settlement. Like the term itself with its connotations of law and    locality, our informants at NetKnowHow reach settlements: 1) by judicious appeals    to other actors who are outside the dispute, and 2) through their highly localized    practices. When the incommensurable systems of value come into conflict in a    project they are sometimes settled by contingent compromises (often through    appeals to the project lead) and by "relativization" (through appeals    to the client). In relativization (Boltanski and Thevenot 1991), the parties    to the disagreement can maintain their principled position; they merely agree    to acc<STRIKE>e</STRIKE>ede to whatever outcome is chosen by the "outsider".    "So, it's settled, right?" The highly localized practices of the project,    so confined in space and time, further contribute to temporary settlements.    Working in such tight quarters creates a forced intimacy and a heightened tolerance.    Where everything is overheard and everyone is monitoring not only what is said    but also the tone of voice, project team members are on the alert for a pitch    of voice that signals an unproductive impasse. "Ok, let's settle this and    get back to work." Deadlines have a way of settling disagreements. </font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not surprisingly like those on the landscape    of the web, these settlements are more provisional than permanent. Limited in    time, localized in space, a project is a provisional settlement. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>Bountiful friction</B> </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The provisional character of project settlements    is an expression of discursive pragmatism. Pragmatic, because provisional settlements    make it possible to get the job done. Discursive, because provisional settlements    are open to reinterpretation when the project is concluded and the next begun.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our understanding of collaboration in heterarchical    organizations is thus more complex than coordination within a project. A frictionless    coordination, in which everyone shared the same performance criteria, might    make life smooth for project managers; but it would lose the creative abrasions    (Brown and Duguid 1998) that are the source of ongoing vitality. Settlements    facilitate coordination within projects; the unsettling activity of ongoing    disputation makes it possible to adapt to the changing topography of the web    across projects in time. Friction promotes reflection, exposing variation from    multiple perspectives. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The type of complex coordination of a discursive    pragmatics thus differs from the silent coordination of circulating boundary    objects (Star and Griesemer 1989). It is not enough to note that coordination    occurs among heterogeneous actors. We should be attentive to their work of persuasion    as they offer competing performance criteria justified by heterogeneous evaluative    principles. In doing so, we see multivocality not as the property of a position    that is structurally privileged by its location as a unique intersection of    multiple networks (Padgett and Ansell, 1993) but as a property of an organization.    Entrepreneurship is not brokering difference between otherwise disconnected    identities but instead occurs at sites where identities and their competing    orders of worth are densely interacting. Complex coordination is a function    not only of the values we share or of the language we have in common (Galison,    1997) but also of our creative misunderstandings. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><B>Notes</B></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="end01"></a><a href="#sup01">1</a> A    young business strategist in a leading new media consulting firm in Silicon    Alley grasped the problem intuitively.

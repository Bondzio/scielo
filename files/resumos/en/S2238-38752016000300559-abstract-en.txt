Abstract The study of moving images produced by native groups around the world allowed Faye Ginsburg to address intercultural issues that demand a methodology attentive to what is visible on the screen as well as to what is out of screen. In this interview Faye Ginsburg expresses her points of view on ethnographic film, visual anthropology and films produced by the indigenous groups. As she argues, the circulation of images requires our attention in order to question the fluency and transparency that characterize the Western imagery tradition. The conversation goes beyond the discussions on visual anthropology, highlighting issues such as cultural mediation, intellectual property, the return and reuse of ethnical archives.

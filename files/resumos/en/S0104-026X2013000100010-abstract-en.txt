Diadorim is the emblematic character of Guimar√£es Rosa, avatar of the female warrior, symbol of a strong sacrifice which we can affirm to be feminist, that one constructed in the denial of the feminine to live a freedom from the beyond-sex realm. The analysis of the character allows evaluating the relationship between body and power as foundation of the known history of the gender domination. We intend to present a feminist reading that permits to investigate the double side of the sexuality that involves Diadorim. Man and alive while dressed, woman and dead when undressed, Diadorim will be a part of an archetypal history, of the topos of the woman/dead. This dead woman is, therefore, "just life" or "naked life" which appears in the contemporary biopolitical analysis. The crossing of feminism and biopolitics is the reading method of the work. It will lead us to see that the function of the textuality of the patriarchy is both enjoy over a woman's dead body and return her to her presumed domestic and antipolitical nature.

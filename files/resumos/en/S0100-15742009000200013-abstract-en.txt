Aligned with the theme of the history of educational institutions and focusing on teacher education, this article aims to assess the changes implemented in the Teacher Education Programme conducted by the Institute of Education of Rio de Janeiro, during the New State period (1937-1945). Initially called Escola de Professores ['Teachers' School'], when the Institute was founded in 1932, the Programme was later taken up by the Federal District University (1935,) under the name of Escola de Educação ['School of Education'] and provided primary and secondary school teachers with Higher Education, in compliance with the Manifesto of New Education Pioneers (1932). With the closing down of the Federal District University in 1939 and the transference of several courses to the recently established University of Brazil, The Institute of Education was excluded from the new project and was able only to provide primary teachers with secondary education certificates. This article exploits the transition that the Institute went through, highlighting changes and continuities in relation to its original proposition. The article then focuses on the unfolding of the rupture caused by the Secondary Education Organic Law (1942), leading to significant changes in the Teacher Education Programme offered by the institution.

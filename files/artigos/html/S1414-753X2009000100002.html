Following the spectacular failure of the British State to    anticipate the political controversy and adverse public reaction to genetically    modified (GM) foods and crops in the late 1990s, a number of influential policy    reports were written, all calling for, <i>inter alia</i>, more proactive public    involvement and deliberation in debates about the social and ethical dimensions    of science and technology (DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, 2000; HM TREASURY/DTI/DFES,    2004; HOUSE OF LORDS, 2000; ROYAL COMMISSION OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION, 1998;    WILSDON; WILLIS, 2004). In the 1970s and 1980s, the argument runs, there was    little meaningful public dialogue on agricultural biotechnology. But by the    late&nbsp;1990s, when controversies about particular GM applications made debate    unavoidable, a dominant - and question-begging - regulatory discourse was already    in place, with major commitments having already been made by industry and governments    (GROVE-WHITE&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.,&nbsp;1997; LEVIDOW; CARR, 2000). Perhaps not    surprisingly, by this stage, attitudes had become polarised (AGRICULTURE AND    ENVIRONMENT BIOTECHNOLOGY COMMISSION,&nbsp;2001; KELLY, 2002). All of this suggests    that 'upstream' forms of public engagement, before lines had been drawn up,    might well have been beneficial. Such thinking has contributed to the belief    that upstream forms of public engagement might play a role in the development    of a more anticipatory and socially robust governance framework.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps not surprisingly,    nanotechnologies have been presented as a key site for experimenting with novel    forms of 'upstream public engagement'. Here is a technology with substantial    promise of radical transformation seen as in danger of running up against comparable    adverse public reaction to that experienced with genetically modified foods    and crops. The publication in July 2004 of the Royal Society/Royal Academy of    Engineering report on nanotechnologies signalled a significant moment in the    evolution of these debates on anticipation (ROYAL SOCIETY/ROYAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING,&nbsp;2004).    Learning from recent experience with biotechnology, policy-makers and scientists    have now begun to look to the social sciences for improved insights on the likely    future impacts of nanotechnologies, and on the role of public engagement to    help fashion more socially robust technologies (MACNAGHTEN&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.,    2005). These commitments to more 'upstream' forms of public engagement in processes    of scientific-technological innovation are a significant move, and raise many    unresolved questions for the social sciences. At what stages in research and    development (R&amp;D) processes is it realistic to raise issues of public accountability    and social concern? How and on whose terms should such issues be debated? Are    dominant institutional discourses of risk, ethics and 'social responsibility'    adequate for addressing these issues? Is it realistic to assume that citizen-consumers    can exercise constructive influence over the pace and direction of technological    (and related social) change? How can these questions be reconciled with the    need to maintain the independence of science, and the economic dynamism of its    applications?</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This paper attempts    to make a modest contribution to this debate through an examination of the process    through which selected members of the public were able to articulate their responses    on the social and ethical dimensions of emerging nanotechnologies (KEARNES;    MACNAGHTEN; WILSDON, 2005). There were substantial challenges in negotiating    such an 'upstream' conversation, arising from: a) the lack of agreed definition    of the term within the nanoscience community; b) the fact that most nanotechnologies    remain at an early or pre-market stage of development, existing largely in terms    of their promise; c) the reality that most people are unfamiliar with the term,    and so presumably do not have pre-existing attitudes as traditionally conceived;    and d) the possibility that salient dimensions of public concerns may not align    with a broadly conceived 'risk' and 'benefit' rubric (as tends to be assumed    by official regulatory and risk assessment vocabularies), and that additional    work may have to be conducted to frame the conversation such that it embraces    wider public values and sentiment. Indeed, in the related domain of GM foods    and animals, a clear research finding was the inadequacy of such official framings    in capturing the character of legitimate public concerns (GROVE-WHITE&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.,    1997, 2000).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2 <i>The methodology</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A methodology was    developed aimed at understanding the factors likely to shape future public responses    to nanotechnologies, and to capture the character of public concerns. A focus    group methodology was chosen, designed to encourage discussion of potential    issues arising for nanotechnology within a framework set by participants' historical    and everyday experience of technology rather than imposed by official regulatory    and risk-assessment vocabularies. The sample consisted of five groups, each    of which met twice, with a gap of one week between the sessions. Participants    were recruited on the basis of their existing participation in local community    or political issues, but with no prior involvement or exposure to nanotechnology.    They included a group of professional men (doctors, architects, civil servants    etc.) - Group 1; a group of professional women (mostly employed as middle managers    in business) - Group 2; a mixed gender group with demonstrable political interests    - Group 3; a group of women with children at school age - Group 4; and a mixed    gender group all of whom expressed an interest in technology - Group 5. The    groups were conducted in Manchester and London in the late summer of 2005.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The group discussions    were designed to enable participants to develop their understanding of what    nanotechnologies were, of how they were being developed in 'real world' circumstances,    and of the issues they were seen to pose by different stakeholders. Given the    complexity and unfamiliarity of the topics under discussion, the groups were    run on two consecutive sessions, each lasting approximately two hours. The first    session began with a discussion of science and technology, of how they are impacting    on everyday life, on the ways in which they are contributing to 'social' questions    and dilemmas, and on what people sensed to be the key issues for the future.    Halfway through the session, the concept of nanotechnology was introduced using    definitions and a scalar diagram taken from the Royal Society/Royal Society    of Engineering report (2004) and setting out domains of application in medicine,    materials and information technology. Participants were next presented with    some everyday consumer products that had been fabricated using nanotechnology,    including a golf ball, a tub of anti-wrinkle cream, and a stain-resistant shirt.    Using a set of concept boards as a stimulus, people discussed three different    visions of nanotechnology: a mainstream view, which focused on projected incremental    developments and economic benefits; a radical utopian perspective, which emphasised    more disruptive potentials for nanotechnology to transform human sensory and    physical capacities; and a sceptical outlook, which focused on potential risks    to the environment and human health, and to wider negative social and ethical    potentials. Each of the boards used text taken from publicly accessible government,    civil society, media and corporate sources. At the end of the first session,    participants were asked to spend the week before the next session exploring    the issues with friends and colleagues, consulting websites, and keeping a journal    for any reflections arising. The follow-up session explored how participants'    perceptions and responses had evolved during the week, and time was set aside    to examine in detail particular social and ethical dilemmas. The session finished    with a discussion of how key stakeholders, including Government, should proceed    and of the conditions necessary for a governance framework.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given the unfamiliarity    of the term, and the undoubted importance of 'framing' to subsequent responses    (NISBET; SCHEUFELE, 2007; SCHEUFELE; TEWKSBURY, 2007), the various presentations    of the term and its applications were carefully crafted to reflect the range    of ways through which nanotechnology is being produced in the public domain.    In particular, the three visions of nanotechnology presented in the stimulus    materials reflected three dominant frames - or styles of thought (FLECK, 1979;    HACKING, 1992; ROSE,&nbsp;2007) - involving not simply what nanotechnology is,    but what it explains, and what is represents. By exposing participants to the    multiple frames characteristic of the emerging public debate, and by encouraging    discussion and exchange on the credibility, legitimacy and authority of such    frames, the design was intended explicitly to simulate the real-world dynamics    through which nanotechnologies and their associated social relationships become    co-produced.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>3 <i>A backdrop    of ambivalence</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both quantitative    and qualitative research on public attitudes to science and technology has tended    to focus on public responses to particular applications with little thought    given to their cumulative impacts and how these diffuse into the felt experience    of everyday life. For this reason, prior to examining responses to nanotechnologies,    participants were asked to reflect on their historical experience of science    and technology, on how it had impacted on day-to-day living, on where this was    seen as going, and on what issues this was likely to pose for now and for the    future. What emerged was a clear sense of the duality of technological experience.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the one hand,    across the group discussions there was a real sense of enthusiasm towards technological    innovation, notably in the information and communication technology domain where    innovation had become so integrated into personal and working life that people    found it difficult to imagine life before email or the mobile phone. While the    material integration of technology had produced numerous benefits it was perceived    also to have been socially disruptive. To the younger and more technologically    literate participants, technology had created additional pressures and expectations.    To the older and more traditional groups, technological innovation was perceived    as a contributing factor to the perceived loss of community, the decline in    courtesy and social relationships, the invasion of privacy, and the blurring    of family/work boundaries. Such expressed concerns were present in discussions    of current impacts but became intensified in discussions on the future. The    anticipated ever-increasing pace, scope and intensity of technological innovation    lead to considerable unease about prospective trajectories, exacerbated, in    part from people's perceived lack of 'voice' in the deliberation and development    of technological R&amp;D, and from a sense that ownership and control were being    consolidated into increasingly large and unaccountable actors, outside the reach    of communities and even national governments. The exchange below is a particularly    vivid example of the 'kept in the dark' narrative, articulated with respect    to people's historical experience of genetic technologies and the lessons that    need to be learnt for the consideration of analogous technological innovation:</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>Eliza: "Well, things like genetics I'm uncomfortable with... It would be      interesting to see how it plays out. But I don't feel that I have control      over &#91;that&#93;, or have any input into how that happens, you know like      cloning or genetic modification or &#91;pause&#93;... It's rushing very quickly      ahead, I don't ever feel like that's been an election issue or &#91;that&#93;      it's been in someone's manifesto. These sorts of things, I think, are going      to be really big questions for humanity, and I think that they're not really      on the agenda, but I don't feel that ... that I can express my opinion...."</p>       <p>Julie: "What you're saying is we haven't had a say again? ... In that these      things are just coming through and... they don't feel the need, no."</p>       <p>Eliza: "But also that the speed with which things are going forward as well,      like I was trying to say before, I don't know, there are a lot of quite well      sort of publicised questions around um, genetic modification which... haven't      been addressed really... that's the way I feel, although I'm a little bit      wary about jumping into, rushing forward with another new technology where      I feel that the old questions haven't even been addressed... Well, I agree      with... the sense that, you know, this idea that we're meddling with things      that we don't actually fully understand, and I know that can seem like a very      kind of... unadventurous."    <br>     (Group 2)</p> </blockquote> </font>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This set of exchanges    is particularly interesting in the way it weaves together collective expressions    of unease as a reflection less of the technology <i>per se</i> but how it is    being shaped, in real world circumstances, with apparently little room for wider    public involvement and discussion (for analogous accounts of this phenomenon    see COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 2007; GROVE-WHITE&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.,    2000; JASANOFF, 2003; MARRIS&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.,&nbsp;2001; WYNNE, 1980). The    choice of discussing genetic technologies, unprompted, across the various discussion    groups, as somehow paradigmatic of broad-based concern with the trajectories    of technological innovation, was widespread and begs explanation. Across the    group discussions genetic technologies were discussed as emblematic of trends    which included: the perception that technological innovation was speeding up,    that such innovation appeared to be increasingly beyond public control, that    existing social and ethical questions had not yet been adequately addressed,    that domains of life were increasingly subjected to technological intervention    with unknown consequences, and that the pace and scope of change was seen as    driven by commercial and short-term goals with little regard to public values    and sensibilities (GROVE-WHITE&nbsp;et&nbsp;al., 1997; MACNAGHTEN, 2004). Time    and again, people looked to the experience of government and corporate handling    of genetically modified foods and crops as grounds for a more cautious approach.    Such discussion cultivated a backdrop of caution in which public responses to    nanotechnologies came to be framed.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>4 <i>Conceptualising    concerns to nanotechnology</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unsurprisingly,    when participants were requested to offer an opinion on the term nanotechnology,    there was little familiarity or knowledge, a finding that parallels attitudinal    survey research both in the UK and United States (BAINBRIDGE, 2002; COBB,&nbsp;2005;    COBB; MACOUBRIE, 2004; DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, 2005; PRIEST, 2006;    ROYAL SOCIETY/ROYAL SOCIETY OF ENGINEERING, 2004; SHEETZ&nbsp;et&nbsp;al., 2005;    WALDRON; SPENCER; BATT, 2006). When pressed, participants tended to characterise    nanotechnology as scientific, clever, small, possibly medical, strange, futuristic,    and something associated with science fiction. Even for the more technologically    literate participants who had heard of nanotechnology and of its 'uncanny' potential    (NORDMANN, 2005), it nevertheless was perceived as foreign, strange and other-worldly:</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote> Alistair: "It's almost the best of all the terms for being one where    I know the idea that nanotechnology is really small technology and occasionally    I'll read something in The Guardian or wherever about - 'it's amazing, these    guys have written their names in atoms on something' and you're like, wow, that's    cool. And you have this very nebulous notion that this is really clever and    that there are... all these possibilities that are, you know, waiting to be    unlocked in nanotechnology. But I actually have no idea you know what they're    really doing and or what these possibilities are. I just have this very vague    notion that it's very clever and it could be really important. And that's kind    of the epitome of what we were talking about before, about not really knowing    the detail."    <br>   (Group 3) </blockquote> </font>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This background    and vaguely affirmative sensibility can help to explain the relatively positive    perceptions of nanotechnology found in attitudinal survey research (BAINBRIDGE,&nbsp;2002;    GASKELL; ALLUM; STARES, 2003; LEE; SCHEUFELE; LEWENSTEIN, 2005; MACOUBRIE, 2005),    where people may be responding broadly to the connotations of the term 'technology'    without much understanding of the detail. Thus, Americans may be adopting modestly    more positive attitudes than Europeans reflecting their apparently more 'pro-technology'    values (GASKELL&nbsp;et&nbsp;al., 2005). In contrast to the research cited above    our interest lay in the examination of the process through which attitudes evolved    and were expressed, and in their underlying narrative structure. Perhaps the    over-riding impression gained in our research was the difficulty of grasping    what nanotechnology was, of what it might do across different areas of application,    and importantly how it was likely to impinge on everyday life. The passages    below, at a stage of discussion following a period of research and reflection,    illustrates how two of the discussion groups struggled to develop and fix their    own thinking:</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>Phil: "It's just so difficult to grasp..."</p>       <p>Dave: "That's why it's so hard to make a decision on whether you think it's      positive or negative. It's so huge, it's not like a single thing like cloning      is... it's such a huge area."</p>       <p>Louise: "Now, I don't, I've gone completely the other way. Well, it's when      he starts to talk..."</p>       <p>Lynne: "I think they need to... separate the different areas of nanotechnology      in order to get a grasp of what it is... because it's very easy to look at      everything at once and get a bit overwhelmed. So you could look at - this      is where it could go medically, this is where it could go militarily, this      is where it could go manufacturing wise sort of thing."</p>       <p>(Group 5)</p>       <p>Rochelle: "It's so extreme the way they're using it now. From things like      as I said, from packaging to medicines to animals. It is so vast the whole      scope."</p>       <p>Karen: "It depends whose hands it falls into."</p>       <p>Renee: "I was surprised &#91;by&#93; the amount of different things they      were talking about and in a way I was, I don't know, felt annoyed that I didn't      know more about it, because there's obviously scientists actively talking      now, developing these sorts of things, and there's been no sort of discussion.      I mean I didn't even know really what it was, about whether or not it's appropriate      that they should be doing these things."</p>       <p>(Group 4)</p> </blockquote> </font>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Examining the narrative    process through which people came to develop collective and shared accounts    of what was 'at stake' in nanotechnology was a key objective of the research    and was found to be linked to people's assessments of the institutional dynamics    seen as likely to govern the development, regulation and oversight of the technology.    Typically, the evolution of expressed attitudes followed a pattern roughly as    follows: from a state of initial ignorance, to surprise at how much research    and R&amp;D was being invested by both governments and industry, to enthusiasm    as to the potential for social good not least in the medical domain, to unease    and anxiety that nanotechnology innovation might lead to largely unanticipated    and disruptive problems in real-world circumstances, to pessimism over our ability    to govern and regulate the technology for the common good. What led people to    positions of unease and apprehension was not simply a consequence of realising    that nanotechnology would enable scientists and other actors to extend control    radically over matter, nature and the human body; but that such control over    the pace, scope and direction of change would be governed by powerful bodies,    propelled by the logics of industrial capitalism, and where the lay public would    be 'left in the dark'. These perceived 'real world' dynamics led to predictions    that nanotechnologies would exacerbate global inequality and facilitate evermore    intense subjection of individual bodies. What emerged thus was a dense array    of concerns; few specific or unique to nanotechnology but distinctive in their    sheer breadth and convergence. For reasons that will be discussed later in this    paper, nanotechnology appeared to have <i>intensified</i> response along familiar    and consistent themes around the body, unanticipated risks, nature's revenge,    control, inequalities, and pace of change. For many people the anxiety potential    of nanotechnology came to the fore in relation to the concerns of nanoparticles    potentially violating bodily processes, either through cosmetics or foods. Just    as genetically modified foods heightened concern on account of being undetectable    by texture, smell or appearance (ADAM, 1998), the invisibility of nanoparticles    and their potential ubiquity into everyday consumer goods resonated with background    fears linked to an enduring narrative of 'bodily invasion'.</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>Rosie: "I imagine.

But if I rub that on my skin or someone's rubbing it      into their skin and therefore there's things going into my skin I'm not aware      of. We've already said this really but no-one knows exactly what that's going      to do and it might have long term effects where, just imagine, free radicals      which I'm sure you know potentially make cells get confused and breaks the      genes in the cells and makes them grow out of control. Any little bit of dirt,      like something that shouldn't be in there pops into the cell, messes with      the actual sequence of what that cell does and you know - that's so scary."</p>       <p>Julie: "Yeah because it can happen without you realising, whereas before,      things, if they were going to invade your body or invade something, you would      see it happening."</p>       <p>Philip: "It's the invisible threat."</p>       <p>Julie: "Yeah, that's it."</p>       <p>Helen: "Because you cannot see it..."</p>       <p>(Group 5)</p> </blockquote> </font>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A visceral example    of this dynamic was voiced in the London group of mothers.

Genetically modified foods, MRSA    (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), mad cow disease and others, were    presented as examples of technological innovation that had been developed in    the face of unanticipated risks of a complex and uncertain nature. Beck's 'Risk    Society' had become an everyday reality (BECK,&nbsp;1992). Nanotechnology was    seen as a further and worrying extension of this dynamic, led, as it appeared    to be, through a hubristic sense of its perceived ability to transform both    society and nature:</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>James: "They will find new bacteria and we will be more resistant.

There are perhaps three interlocking explanations.    First, people responded to the metaphysics embedded in the radical and utopian    vision of nanotechnology as cause for alarm. The metaphysical project, common    in this particular narrative of nanotechnology, presents the technology as an    enabler of human capacities, needs, desires and potentialities. Through nanotechnology,    the argument runs, people will be able to transcend their material and 'natural'    constraints and thus realise full liberation and emancipation. While such a    narrative has been given most visible expression in the National Science Foundation    report on Converging Technologies (ROCO; BAINBRIDGE, 2002), it nevertheless    represents a wider emergent style of thought characteristic of much of nanotechnology    in the US policy context (NORDMANN, 2007), and reflective more widely of characteristically    American ideals of technology (NOBLE,&nbsp;1999). Below is how one of the groups    attempted to express what they found troubling in this vision:</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>Neil: "If you actually took that wholly on board, everything that's printed      on there, it's quite a frightening scenario, isn't it. So this wonderful nanotechnology      is going to be a cure all for all human ills, it's going to make us all super      brilliant and clever and work that much better, our transport's going to be      far better even though the fact that nobody will be dying of old age, nobody      will be dying of any illnesses so we won't be able to move on this planet.      Yet we'll be able to move about quicker because the trains or whatever will      be much more efficient. It's - a lot of what is written there is really &#91;is&#93;      in effect going against nature isn't it, it's trying to beat nature at its      own game and going back to what I said before about the medical side of it,      it is rather frightening I think. It is very welcoming if it's used to treat      cancers and stuff like that but I think that somewhere along the line we're      getting into this Brave New World scenario here where everything's &#91;pause&#93;,      it's this ideal world where everyone lives forever and everybody has everything,      everybody can do everything...

Rather, they represented deeper unease with the metaphysical programme    driving the technology, its embedded assumptions of what constitutes human progress    and improvement, and its potentially troubling implications for wider society.    Perhaps even more than biotechnologies, here was a technological programme based    on a style of thought that conceives of nature and humans as infinitely malleable,    and which presents a thoroughly questionable view of human improvement as given.    Jean-Pierre Dupuy has developed a critical analysis of the metaphysical programme    that underpins radical nanotechnology and its convergence with biotechnology,    information technology and cognitive science (DUPUY, 2007, 2009; DUPUY; GRINBAUM,    2004). For Dupuy, perhaps the most conspicuous element of the nanotechnological    dream is its dissatisfaction with the world as inherited through 'bricolage'    and 'hit and miss' evolutionary process (DUPUY,&nbsp;2009). By contrast, the    world - and its component constituents of living and non-living matter - is    in principle reconstructable and thus available for redesign and improvement,    literally from the bottom-up, atom by atom. Indeed, nanotechnology's much cited    goal of 'controlling the structure of matter' through interventions at the nanoscale    (from 1-100 nm), is at that precise scale at which the distinction between life    and non-life has lost all meaning. For Dupuy (2009) this represents a deliberate    and clandestine attempt to blur a fundamental distinction that has until now    been a significant source of everyday moral judgement and ethical reason.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The imputed ideal    of a hyper-technological age involving radical 'improvements' in bodily function    and capacity was debated in other groups. While superficially appealing to some,    these developments were seen to raise substantial moral and social issues, not    least the ability for governments, industry and other darker forces to exercise    sufficiently robust forms of control and oversight over its mediation on everyday    life activities. The consensual response was to appeal for such innovations    to 'slow down' to ensure that scientific advance was properly in tune with wider    public values and societal oversight. The discussion below highlights the sensed    dangers of technology proceeding <i>as if</i> it, and we, were not part of life    and natural process:</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>Sally: "I find it quite daunting actually, I find it a bit scary."</p>       <p>Rochelle: "This is the vision of the robotic environment with everything      controlled for you and everything 100% perfect and plastic."</p>       <p>Renee: "It's like even the food... Food has got a process the same as we've      got a natural process you know, you're born, you get older, you get wrinkles,      you die. Same as fruit, you buy a piece of fruit it's healthy, after a piece      of time it wrinkles you throw it away or whatever and that is a natural process      and I think in some ways it's kind of fiddling with that natural process."</p>       <p>Moderator: "So you think skin should be allowed to wrinkle?"</p>       <p>Rochelle: "Well at the end of the day it's... it's part of life - if we all      looked 36 or 37 or whatever."</p>       <p>Karen: "It's just if you get rid of the wrinkles by whatever, are you going      to end up causing cancer or something else you haven't even invented yet."</p>       <p>(Group 4)</p> </blockquote> </font>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How should one    characterise the ethical character of concerns that are being appealed to? As    with Davies (2006) characterisation of ethical talk on xenotransplantation,    it is apparent that nanotechnologies have the potential to blur key distinctions    through which social life is ordered. This constitutes the second explanation    and includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the blurring of the idea that enhancement is    distinct from therapy, that we can never completely get rid of diseases, that    humans live and die, that humans and machines are fundamentally distinct, that    matter can be made from the bottom up, and that everything can be made, unmade    and remade<a name="nt02a"></a><a href="#nt02b"><sup>1</sup></a>. It is the perceived    neglect of such boundary work within the broader nanotechnology community -    or what Dupuy (2009) calls a false humility that consists in denying that anyone    has been done out of the ordinary - that people found disturbing, as illustrated    in one particular apt remark by a participant in Group 5: '<i>It's like nanotechnology    is the new God</i>'. This comment, deploying the 'false humility' narrative,    reflects not simply the perceived lack of limits in much of nanotechnology talk,    but the more troubling perception that nanoscientists were proceeding with little    regard or understanding or even awareness of the endeavour in which they were    participating. In particular, and making use of an older set of metaphysical    assumptions premised on the notion that there exists a wider patterning and    order to life which we ignore at our peril, were expressed concerns about the    'unnaturalness' of the undertaking. One way in which this was expressed was    in arguments on the likelihood of 'nature's revenge': that the more radical    and interventionist the attempt to control and intervene in nature the stronger    and more potent the likely retort. The exchange below articulates the use of    such a 'Promeathean' narrative, and of nature taking vengeance as a direct consequence    of our interference and meddling:</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>Julie: "That's the problem, is what we're interfering with again is nature,      the natural cycle of things, which is where I have a problem. It's partly      that it is sort of right that sometimes crops are wiped out, there's sort      of a reason for everything I think."</p>       <p>Rosie: "I wouldn't trust nature not to seize upon it as it's done with these      super-weeds..."</p>       <p>(Group 2)</p> </blockquote> </font>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An interesting    variant of the above critique were accounts arising from the mechanistic metaphor    that tends to imbue much nanotechnology rhetoric. Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent    analyses the ways in which molecular biology and materials science converge    on a thoroughly 'artificialist view of nature'. She sets out the multiple ways    in which nanotechnologies rely on a conception of biological life and the human    body using mechanistic concepts and metaphors: most notably around the cell    and its molecular components as nanoscale machines (BENSAUDE-VINCENT, 2004).    Using George Canguilhem as inspiration, she argues that that such a project    has demonstrable ethical components, and that the mechanization of life is inseparable    from a project of instrumentalization of life and control over nature. In our    discussion groups, the extreme mechanization which nanotechnology represents    was also seen as connected to forms of government and corporate control and    their propensity for new and more direct forms of subjection. This unease, making    use of such 'artificialist' narrative, was voiced eloquently by the one of the    London groups, that, 'we're turning into robots':</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>Renee: "I mean it's exactly what somebody over here said before, we're turning      into robots. That is exactly what it sounds like..."</p>       <p>Renee: "When it comes directly to human beings and trying to make them...,      it's like trying to make a perfect race again, going to that."</p>       <p>Karen: "We just don't know the long term effects do we, that's the problem."</p>       <p>Renee: "But you have to know the side effects and what we're letting ourselves      in for."</p>       <p>Toni: "So basically our generation's going to be like the ones that they      test this all out on, if it all goes horribly wrong, we'll be the guinea pigs."</p>       <p>(Group 4)</p> </blockquote> </font>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again Dupuy provides    a metaphysical explanation to such commentary arguing that precisely when 'being    human' is reduced to the status of an object that can be fashioned and shaped    at will - the very conception of mind as machine that enables us to imagine    our ability to recreate life and matter in our own image - we lose much of our    ethical capacity for critical reflection (DUPUY, 2009). Without ethical boundaries    grounded in a conception of social order the concept of self limitation loses    meaning. In such an ethically restricted world there is little reason to presume    why nanotechnologies will not be deployed to extend control and reduce autonomy.    The exchange points to the forms of subjection that a programme of human enhancement    was seen as likely to engender:</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>Paul: "I think the worrying thing for me... is that it's almost as though      we lose control of what's going on because the technology itself is capable      of almost taking, replicating, and almost making, you know, pretty much making      its own decisions."</p>       <p>Philip: "I think that is a big problem. It's like the thing you were saying      with the creativity as well. If the human controls the technology that's fine,      as soon as it becomes the technology making all the decisions then that's      when you have a problem, because... humans are completely different from a      computer."</p>       <p>Paul: "There's some scary dark futures where you have strains of children      who are, and are not enhanced in some way, and that's a really dodgy thing.      I mean enhancement, the ageing process and things like that..."</p>       <p>James: "Do you have your kids injected at birth to enhance their, the way      their muscles grow and things..."</p>       <p>(Group 5)</p> </blockquote> </font>      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The above dynamics    contributed to the sensed difficulty of developing robust and effective systems    of governance and regulation. One the one hand, there was a perceived requirement    for wise and strong forms of government and oversight. Yet, on the other hand,    there was a shared concern that governance structures and requirements would    be compromised, inevitably, by 'real-world' contingencies arising from the constraints    of living in a globalised economy as well as the sensed intractability of nanotechnology's    metaphysical programme. Crudely, it was seen as unrealistic to advocate a 'slow    down' or to develop a properly cautious approach to nanotechnological innovation.    A couple of variations were mobilised in the discussions: that an overly precautionary    approach would lead inevitably to outward investment; that Government has a    poor track record in sorting out even modest technological controversies such    as mobile phone masts; that much of innovation is transnational and pretty much    beyond the control of individual governments; and that the pressure for commercial    return will inevitably lead to corners being cut.</font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      <blockquote>        <p>Karen: "...it is interesting to say that that &#91;referring to previous      conversation on the need for research into the toxicity of nanoparticles&#93;      will take years and years, yet the whole thing we've been talking about is      that these things happen so quickly, so why can't we slow it down, is it going      to matter that much if it is slowed down?"</p>       <p>Others: "mmm, yeah, slowed down, yeah"</p>       <p>Rosie: "But the only thing is, say this country does that and slows it down,      then you're gonna go abroad...yeah, and it's gonna come back into this country      anyway."</p>       <p>(Group 2)</p> </blockquote> </font>      <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>6 <i>Some reflections</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This research presents    a picture of emergent public opinion characterised by a dense array of issues    - moral, social, political, as well as technical - and of the fundamental challenges    this poses for governance. Importantly, it suggests that the public can differentiate    these issues, and deliberate their social meanings in more complex terms than    simply as 'risks' and 'benefits'. Perhaps most significantly it offers an explanation    as to why people expressed such bleak and pessimistic views on the future prospects    of the technology; that just when we as a collectivity require strong ethical    and regulatory governance structures to guide and shape the development of nanotechnologies    in socially progressive and responsive directions, that very possibility appears    to be denied by a socio-technical system that believes that nothing special    is being undertaken, that considers its dreams of control and improvement to    require little external endorsement or explanation, and that is embedded within    a set of master narratives in which science and technology are staged unambiguously    as the solution to a range of social ills (COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,    2007). Faced by such double-blind it is inevitable that people respond to what    is at hand, mobilising the range of cultural resources and 'folk theories' through    which they can make sense and render familiar a strange, uncanny and potentially    transformative set of technologies (Rip,&nbsp;2006). For this reason it is important    to articulate the kinds of narrative argumentative strategies used by participants    to justify their positions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Parallel research    has outlined several prominent tropes and narratives underpinning public responses    to nanotechnology: ranging from the 'slippery slope' narrative, that technological    advances that seem beneficial now will inevitably evoke further technological    steps and applications that are morally doubtful; the 'colonisation' narrative,    that technology will spread out and ultimately colonise life denying autonomy    and agency; the 'Dr Strangelove' narrative, that advanced science designed for    'good use' will become corrupted and manipulated by evil people for evil purposes;    the 'Trojan Horse' narrative, that innovations developed for progressive purposes    will in the long term have unforeseen and potentially irreversible effects;    and the 'it's out' narrative, that involves the accidental release of harmful    substances often due to technological and/or human failure (SWIERSTRA; RIP,    2006; REJESKI, 2007). In our research we can add at least five further narrative    variations through which people were able to develop viewpoints and argumentative    positions. These include: the 'left in the dark' narrative, that nanotechnology    reflects a further instance of not being able to participate in decisions that    will structure future social relationships; the 'bodily invasion' narrative,    that involves the introduction of invisible substances that subsequently violate    natural processes; the 'Promethean' narrative, involving nature taking retribution    on nanoscience's hubristic sense of its ability to transform both nature and    humans to its own will and in violation and disregard for evolutionary process;    the 'artificialist' narrative, that inadvertently instrumentalises life and    human relationships through conceiving of biological and mental life purely    as machines; and the 'false modesty' narrative, involving the pretense that    nothing special is being undertaken.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This research thus    endorses and compliments David Rejeski's argument that it is illusory to suppose    that nano fear will disappear (REJESKI, 2007). By contrast, our research points    to a wide range of common narratives that continue to shape and structure popular    responses to science and technology. Of course, there exist counter narratives    too, around technology as progress, science as salvation and enabler, and so    on. But such narratives will be played out on the larger cultural stage whose    interplay will depend on complex institutional dynamics, not least around the    sensed ability of governments and corporations to provide leadership, authority,    effective regulation and adequate control in the face of a scientific enterprise    whose purposes and priorities are increasingly questioned.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this respect    this paper contributes to what has been termed the 'new scientific governance'    (IRWIN, 2006) but in a manner less concerned with the tacit power relations    in public engagement exercises and more concerned with the ways in which master    narratives of science and technology may be imposing social order in unaccountable    and potentially troubling ways. Building on the analysis undertaken in the European    Commission working document 'Taking European Knowledge Seriously', this paper    gives empirical grounding to the claim that the institutional framing of advanced    science and technology (in this case nanotechnology) is in danger of becoming    seriously dislocated from wider cultural values and aspirations (COMMISSION    OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 2007). Developing institutional reflexivity and    understanding of the factors underlying public uneasiness with science will    be a major challenge in which the social sciences offer a modest contribution.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Acknowledgements</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I would like to    acknowledge support from the Economic and Social Research Council for the project    'Nanotechnology, risk and sustainability: developing upstream models of public    engagement' (award no: RES-338-25-0006) out of which this analysis was developed.

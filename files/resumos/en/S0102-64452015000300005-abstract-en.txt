Abstract This article reports the experience of the workshops "Storytelling reveals meaning without committing the error of defining it" on human rights and creative writing taught by the authors - activities guided by the philosophical work of Hannah Arendt. The methodology was inspired by an Arendt's course entitled "Political experiences in the twentieth century" (1965), reported by Celso Lafer in the article "Experience, action and narrative: reflections on a course by Hannah Arendt". The creative writing has proved to be a powerful tool to the reflection on issues involving human rights, especially in times of crisis.

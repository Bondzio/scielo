Abstract: In a recent document UN Women stressed the importance of overcoming the demand for mere formal equality, and assumed that the goal of substantive equality is the way to reconcile economic policy and human rights. In this text, I comment on the challenges posed to this move, observing its recent tendencies from the point of view of care work and gender inequalities, taking Brazil as an empirical reference.

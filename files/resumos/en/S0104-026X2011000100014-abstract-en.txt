This paper advocates for a queer perspective in political ecology. Understanding heterossexism as part of the oppressive network of relations that organizes the human-nature connections, Sandilands proposes another way to view nature-human-sexuality relations. She tells us about the beginning of the environmental movement in North America and the different heteronormative ideologies that connect natural spaces to heterossexuality while seeing homosexuality as related to an urban degenerescence. She seeks inspiration in LGBT literature and history to confront this opposition of nature and homossexuality to propose a queer ecology. The most inspirational words come from Zita Grover, whose perspective in ecology marked by the painful experience of being affected by AIDS is very sensitive, being able to draw metaphorical connections between AIDS and other ecological concepts.

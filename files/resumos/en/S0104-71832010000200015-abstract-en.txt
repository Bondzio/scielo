Many anthropological studies establish that childhood, as a social category, is an historical and socio-cultural product associated with a biological development process. From these positions it is possible to consider the human child incorporation into society, considering time as sociality parameter. This conceptualization allows discussion about the modern idea of childhood as first stage of a mono-chronic and linear time development, period devoted to learning adulthood -defined as a working time in opposition to latter. Childhood conceived as a first of a succession of stages clearly distinguished is not only a common sense -and appropriated by subjects among their lifetime-, but also is the general basis for childhood rights protection laws. Even so, anthropology can expand the limits of such regulations studying how children have, in everyday activities, a plurality of time's repertoires in which they learn and also, participating in some productive activities, become part of social knowledge production.

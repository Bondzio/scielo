The transition being undergone by women from unpaid domestic work to remunerated employment, since the mid-20th century, due to the restructuring of capitalist economies, and, above all, the growth of the tertiary sector, has accelerated a shift away from family infant/child care, which has been becoming more and more shared with public and private institutions. The aim of this article is to examine how some of the care systems work in Brazil, in particular the family, the labour legislation and child education, with a special focus on gender and social class. It seeks to understand how such arenas of care influence the quantity and quality of mothers' participation in the labour market.

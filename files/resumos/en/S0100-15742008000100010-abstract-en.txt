By taking into account the nature, configurations, and meanings of the teaching work as its analysis object, this article discusses the methodology being developed in a research project. The text addresses the methodological-theoretical choices made, the field work done with teachers and the preliminary results achieved. The conclusions confirm the researchers' initial expectation concerning the ability expressed by teachers of getting involved in the analysis of their own work, the confidence in the collective work and the possibility of changes by means of their organization.

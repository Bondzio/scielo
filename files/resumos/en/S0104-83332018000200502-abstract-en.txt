Abstract This article analyzes the trajectories of three Argentinean female academics who study genders and sexuality. It highlights trips abroad as turning points in the orientation of their studies, their lines of research and their institutional insertions. Based on in-depth interviews, three figures of travel were constructed (militant, anthropological and cosmopolitan) to explain the singularities of these experiences and their impact on each of the trajectories and on the development and diversification of this field of knowledge in Argentina.

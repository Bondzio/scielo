This article examines different dimensions of culture and the controversies surrounding this term when used to refer to "popular culture(s)";. Unlike studies on the axis culture-popular culture, an attempt is made to return to the beginning of the Brazilian popular culture movements in 60's, in order to bring them closer to the present time. In doing so, it will be possible to show how culture and popular culture were taken to the field of political praxis, integrating in them a new meaning given to education itself. The discussion points out that a substantive issue to be considered is if culture and education are conceived as spaces overtly open and dialogical in nature, typical of the difficult and complex art of creating, sharing and interchanging of (and between) popular cultures the role of knowledge and of the knowledge reproduction.

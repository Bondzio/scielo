In this article, we analyze the characteristics of rural work in Teresópolis, focusing on the associations between pesticides use indicators. We intend to subsidize discussions about the legislation on pesticide use. Data includes personal and farms characteristics, pesticides and intoxication variables collected through questionnaires applied in an IBGE research conducted in Teresópolis municipality - RJ. Through exploratory data analysis and logistical regression, it was possible to find risk and protection factors related to pesticide intoxication. The paper highlights the need to create regulatory policies, to minimize risk and maximize protection factors related with rural workers health.

Schrim (2010) posits that the "regional power" needs to have a "role definition",    and it should possess material power (hard power), in addition to military power.

Then, it will analyze its power capacity in terms    of its economic power, diplomatic power, and soft power. This paper will not    examine Turkey's military power because the main focus of the paper will be    on Turkey's 'economic potential' and 'soft power capacity' as well as its 'diplomatic    power'. In the second section, it will elaborate on Turkish foreign policy and    its engagement with other emerging states in two sections: first, throughout    the financial (global) crisis; second, after the political crisis in Turkey    (Gezi Park uprisings and power struggle with the Fetullah Gulen movement).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>II. Turkey's    growing economy: Its impact of Turkish foreign policy</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turkey, in a little    more than a decade ago, has gone from a financial crisis to having one of the    fastest growing economies in the world. Especially after the global financial    crisis, in 2008, Turkey aspired to seek global leadership when great powers    faced challenges in this new era. Emerging economies such as the BRICS (five    major emerging nations- Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and the    G-20 (Group of 20 major economies- Turkey is now in G-20) have done much better    during and after the global financial crisis. During the global crisis, Turkey    has been viewed as a rising (emerging) economic power; and tried to act as a    global player in international platforms. AKP leadership has aspired to achieve    its 2,023 goals, which is to become one of the leading 10 economies in the world.    Moreover, as "Turkey's AKP has provided stability and vision", (Byrant &amp;    Hatay, p. 1) to the country, Turkey has been revealed, by some circles the United    States (U.S.), as a 'model' of democracy for the Muslim world, particularly    in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Notwithstanding its internal ups    and downs in its own performance in democracy lately seen in the jailing of    hundreds of students, academics and journalists since AKP came to power, Turkey    is still being considered to be a democratic country and an inspiration for    other countries in the region.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The development    of infrastructure and institutions of governance, the explosive growth of its    economy, as well as the combination of a religiously conservative governing    party and secular governance have made the "Turkish model" a well-known rhetoric    (Byrant &amp; Hatay 2013, p. 1). Nevertheless, Meliha Altun</font><font  size="2">&#305;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">s</font><font  size="2">&#305;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">k,    a prominent scholar in the Middle East Technical University in Turkey, has stresses    that a "Turkish model" rhetoric has been present since the beginning of the    Turkish Republic after the Turkish independence war, when "unlike the other    countries of the region, Turkey was born out of a determination not to accept    the post-WW I settlement that was imposed on it by the winners of the war" (Altun</font><font  size="2">&#305;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">s</font><font  size="2">&#305;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">k    2008, p. 200). Turkey's reforms and modernization efforts, throughout the Mustafa    Kemal Atat&uuml;rk era, became a role model or rather an inspiration for other    Muslim countries such as Pakistan, Tunisia and Iran (until the 1979 Islamic    Revolution).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Council on    Foreign Relations (CFR) expert Steven A. Cook asserted that the Obama administration    perceived Turkey, "not just as a geostrategic asset, but as a potential partner"    in the Mideast, especially after tremendous change in the region.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>    Nevertheless, if there was such a thing as the "Turkish moment", it seems to    have passed as hope in Arab countries has faded away. Arab Spring left the ground    to a "harsh and dark winter" instead of bringing different colors to the region.    The Arab Spring did not bloom, but has given way to the hard realities of building    democracy. It took centuries for the European countries to become democracies    after the bloody French revolution. Since 1923, Republic of Turkey is still    striving to become a democratic country and seems to have a long way to go.    Civil society in Turkey is not strong and effective. Turkey has not been able    to build strong institutions like the European Union countries such as Germany,    France and Britain. Thus, Turkey could not move to a genuine liberal form of    democracy, which led to the accumulation of centralized power. Turkey's institutions    and checks and balances in the Turkish constitution are weakening.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>    Nonetheless, the AKP leadership has strived to assume a natural "leader" role    in the region. This goal has also had an impact on its foreign policy.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>III. Turkey's    assumed foreign policy roles and its relations with its neighbors and with emerging    powers</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the past decade,    Turkish foreign policy has barely been on a rising and steady curve. Turkish    Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's policy of "zero problems" with Turkey's neighbors    has turned into "zero partners". Turkey no longer has strategic partners or    reliable allies due to its "uncertain foreign policy." In the course of "unexpected    circumstances" it has lost not only its former allies' trust but also has lost    regional ties with countries like Iraq, Iran and Syria. For instance, Iran remains    a threat (a nuclear threat if it acquires nuclear weapons in the near future)    because it has announced that it would attack Turkey with its missiles if it    was struck by Israeli or American forces. Iran has made this public; right after    Turkey signed the missile defense agreement with North Atlantic Treaty Organization    (NATO) and placed the radar system in K&uuml;re&ccedil;ik to NATO's use. Syria's    civil war and Turkey's support to the Sunni extremist opposition groups in Syria    has worsened its relation with not only Iran but also Syria as well as its former    partners such as Israel and the United States. Turkey's relation with Israel    is not much better after Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's apology to the Turkish    Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the Mavi Marmara incident.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand,    Turkey has tried to develop its economic relations with countries which it has    historical links. Additionally, it has improved its relations with countries    in parts of subsaharan Africa. For example, the number of Turkish embassies    in recent years in Africa has grown from 12 to 34 and it has signed a number    of trade agreements. Before the Arab Spring, in the late 2000s, the lifting    of visa restrictions throughout the neighboring region was another example of    "active foreign policy" that Davutoglu has pursued. New markets have opened.    This in turn, has enhanced Turkey's economic growth. Turkish aid investment    has increased, in the Muslim countries of north and subsaharan Africa and particularly    the Turkic countries of Central Asia. Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency's    (T&uuml;rk Isbirligi ve Koordinasyon Ajans</font><font  size="2">&#305;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    or TIKA) budget in 2011 was US$ 1.73 billion, which is not an insignificant    figure when compared to the European Union Development Fund's budget that is    around 3.78 </font><font  size="2">&#8364;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    billion (US$ 5 billion) available annually for its work in non-EU or non-neighborhood    development (EU Development Policy 2014). The current map of the activities    of the TIKA illustrates that of the 30 countries that have TIKA coordination    offices only five are in countries without noteworthy Muslim populations, namely    Moldovia, Macedonia, Georgia, Ukraine and Kenya.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turkey focused    on improving its ties with the South Caucasus, Balkans and Middle East. These    are the regions where Turkey does the most business; and engages in aid and    development projects. According to the PRIO-TESEV report, "neo-Ottoman" rhetoric    is the most predominant strategy that shapes the country's soft power politics    in its neighborhood. B&uuml;lent Aras, director of the Strategic Research Center    in Ankara, the think-tank of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, argues    that Turkey's new strategy is "to initiate a psychological breakthrough in the    Balkans "to undo the negative memories of the past". (Aras 2012, p. 1) By doing    so, Turkey tries to use its soft power to enhance its economic relations with    countries in the region. In this context, "the new Turkish foreign policy is    aimed at using this regional and historically based politics as a springboard    to a global position". (Byrant &amp; Hatay 2013, p. 3). On the other hand, according    to the International Strategic Research Organization (USAK) report, Turkey still    is not a regional leader because a regional leader need to have not only material    power resources such as economic, diplomatic and organizational capacity, in    addition to military power (Din&ccedil;er &amp; Kutlay 2012). There is little    doubt Turkey perceives itself as a <i>model</i> (Byrant &amp; Hatay 2013, p.    3), but in the Middle East Turkey is perceived less as a model than as an aspiration.    Middle Eastern countries aspire to be like Turkey not because of Turkey's political    system but because of Turkey's economic success.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turkey's soft power    has been growing through its attractiveness to its neighborhood since the AKP    government came to power. Turkish products, television, schools as well as development    aid has increased its soft power. Turkish universities are being established,    while religious leader Fethullah G&uuml;len's (G&uuml;len Cemaat) schools are    mushrooming in South Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Balkans. Turkish construction    companies are rebuilding some parts of Georgia. Additionally, Turkish big business    is initiating new businesses and opening factories in Bulgaria. Moreover, Turkish    banks dominate the finance sector in Bosnia. Furthermore, Turkish brands are    flooding the markets in Egypt, Iraq as well as formerly Syria. "Throughout the    Balkans, South Caucasus, and Middle East, people watch Turkish movies and media,    and Turkish soap operas are popular throughout the Middle East, where they spread    a vision of a Turkish way of life that is modern but Muslim". (Byrant &amp;    Hatay 2013, p. 18).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turkey has assumed    different foreign policy roles as: "natural leader" of the region; a historical    "big brother;" and "the protector" of the Muslim minorities. Thus, by assuming    such roles Turkey tried to solidify its long desired role as a "rising power"    by increasing its influence in its neighborhood and engaging with other emerging    powers. Turkey's new foreign policy has also been called "neo-Ottomanism" (AKP's    aspiration to go back to the Ottoman era) by various circles in both Europe    and the United States. Turkey's particular interest in those countries of the    former Ottoman sphere, with which it believes itself to have historical and    cultural ties, has been questioned. Moreover, it is argued that it has undertaken    a historical role as a leader of the Muslim. The course the AKP government is    taken has been puzzling. Foreign Minister Davutoglu rejects the neo-Ottoman    label;<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> there seems little    doubt that the AKP leadership perceives Turkey to be a "natural" leader of the    region. AKP parliamentarians have expressed this aspiration. Fehmi Kinay, who    has been an AKP parliamentarian since 2002, has suggested that Prime Minister    Tayyip Erdrogan could unite the Sunni sects.<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prime Minister    Erdogan's also seems to assume a role as the Muslim leader. Turkey assumes the    "protector" and "big brother" role; punishes when it considers necessary and    aids the weak Muslim countries and (extremist) Sunni groups (Byrant &amp; Hatay    2013, p. 2). For instance, Prime Minister Erdogan's support to extremist Sunni    Muslim groups in Syria and also its visit to Libya, in 2011, and his relation    with the leader of the National Transitional Council was considered to be an    act that illustrated his will to be a <i>Halife</i> (Muslim leader) in the MENA.    Another example to this argument has been Turkey's aid to Somalia. This policy    was perceived as a "geo-strategic vision." It was argued that Turkey was seeking    new allies. "The discourse of common Islamic values underpins Turkey's engagement    in Africa, emphasizing its normative foundation" (Aynte 2012). Hence, AKP leadership    assumes a role that entails setting an example for the counties in the region.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand,    it can also be argued that Turkey's new foreign policy has enhanced its economic    growth. This is founded on a vision of Turkey as regional leader. The AKP leadership    perceives itself as having not only the responsibility but also the power to    act. Even though Turkey's Western allies, both the U.S. and the European Union    (EU) are skeptical about Turkey policies both in domestic politics and foreign    policies, AKP leadership does not pay any attention to the critics and it is    willing to assume a leadership role. This new role can be observed in many incidents:    Erdo</font><font  size="2">&#287;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">an's    reaction at Davos to Shimon Peres; Turkey's disapproval of the Israeli response    to the Mavi Marmara flotilla aiming to breach the Gaza barricade; AKP's support    to Hamas; its aid to extremist groups in Syria. All these can be considered    signs of a country that perceives itself as a "Muslim leader". This motive led    to AKP leadership to engage in building new relationship with not only countries    in its neighborhood but also engaging in emerging powers such as Brazil and    China. Turkey, thus, turned its back to its former Western allies. But the so-called    Gezi Park uprising and the power struggle between Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan    (Menzili Tarikat) and religious leader Fetullah G&uuml;len (G&uuml;len Cemaat)    in Turkey have changed not only Turkey's power capacity but its diplomatic power    and soft power. Both events have decreased both its soft power and diplomatic    power in the region.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>IV. Turkey's    power capacity before and after Gezi Park Protests: diplomatic power and soft    power in the neighborhood and Turkey's engagement with emerging powers</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gezi Park uprising    in Turkey was a remarkable development in history of Turkey. People occupied    public spaces and tried to reach out to the government with slogans, which contained    hummer in it. But the government did not react to it in a constructive way as    in Brazil (where there were protests approximately at the same time). The protests    began when a group of people started the Taksim Solidarity (Taksim Dayan</font><font  size="2">&#305;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">smas</font><font  size="2">&#305;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">)    due to environmental concerns. They intended to save hundreads of trees at Gezi    Park and "halt an urban development project to rebuild the historical Ottoman    barracks..." (Yayla 2013). The group, before long, occupied the park and built    tents to demonstrate their concern. This movement grew further and high school    and university students joined the passive protests. But on May 31<sup>st</sup>,    2013 the authorities attempted to forcefully evacuate the park through extensive    use of pepper gas, which resulted in clashes and injuries. The AKP government's    rhetoric of freedom and democracy was questioned because these events clearly    demonstrated that it lacked substance at home.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Gezi Park uprisings    "surpassed their local and national appeal and, before long, attracted global    interest". (<i>ibidem</i>). Among the Arab nations this was seen as a sign that    the AKP government was not a democratic country and Turkey was no longer viewed    as an inspiration to other Arab countries. Not only the Gezi Park protests but    also the power struggle between the AKP leadership and Fethullah G&uuml;len    has created doubts about Turkey's democratic and secular regime. "The movement    of charismatic cleric, Fethullah G&uuml;len, having a strong hold on Turkish    politics and social life", (Byrant &amp; Hatay 2013, p. 14) has disturbed Prime    Minister Erdogan and he has decided to close down the G&uuml;len's schools.    G&uuml;len's schools and universities were opening branches abroad and in Turkey    and this was one of the soft powers of Turkey in its neighborhood. "Turkey's    role as a stabilizing force may be undermined by the current government's Islamist    leanings and ties". (<i>ibidem</i>). On the other hand, Turkey's role as "protector"    of Muslim minorities in South Caucasus and the Balkans are also viewed to be    in conflict with its foreign policy interests. Additionally, in the post-Arab    Spring Middle East some groups such as Salafi and Shia's are concerned about    Turkey's role as a "big brother" trying to provide a "role model" to the Arab    countries. Especially, the Salafi in Saudi Arabia, the secularist in Egypt and    the Shia regime in Iran brought this event to the agenda.<sup><a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8">8</a></sup>    According to some circles in Europe, "Turkey's rhetoric of democracy contrasts    with failures of democracy at home". (Byrant &amp; Hatay 2013, p. 17). AKP leadership    has been much less successful at encouraging and protecting democratic values    at home. Therefore, Turkey's soft power has declined gradually. The efforts    of AKP leadership to assume a role as a "natural leader" and a "rising power"    came to nowhere. So the efforts to increase Turkish influence and presence in    the South Caucasus, Balkans and Middle Eastfailed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand,    in the global context, AKP government called the redefinition of the role of    the United Nations (UN) and particularly the UN Security Council. This call    has been the "key planks in Turkey's attempts to leverage itself into a global    role". It attempted to play an active role as a facilitator and mediator during    the negotiations with Iran side by side with Brazil, which is considered to    be an emerging power in the new global order. According to the recent report    from the Center for a New American Security Turkey as well as Brazil, India    and Indonesia are considered to be "swing states" (those states whose alliances    have still not been determined). In the new regional order, these countries    should be molded into a significant regional broker by the U.S. and EU. The    polarities of power are ambiguous in this new international order since U.S.    is "exhausted by security wars and an EU struggling with financial crisis".    (Kliman &amp; Fontaine 2013, p. 8). Not only the ambitions and interests of    Brazil, Russia and China needs to be considered but also the aspirations of    other "intermediate states" (Turkey can be named as intermediate state),<sup><a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9">9</a></sup>    with regional influence and wide scope, needs to be calculated. Brazil, India    and South Africa can be considered as "intermediate states", which are regional    powers (Hurrell 2006).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These states have    some capacity for effective international action. Additionally, they seem to    possess a considerable range of economic and political power resources. This    gives them the ability to contribute to the making of international order in    the regional and global levels. They also believe that they should have a more    influential role in international politics and search for recognition in multiple    ways, such as the struggle for recognition of regional spheres of influence    and the criticism of asymmetries. They can also use international cooperation    &#150; sometimes in the form of international institutions &#150; to signal    reassurance to weaker states, particularly within their regions, and tame great    powers through established rules and procedures. Besides having "voice opportunities"    to make known their interests and bid for political support, those states see    in international cooperation political spaces to build new coalitions in order    to change norms in ways that are more compatible with their interests and balance    policies of the most powerful.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Intermediate states'    such as Turkey and Brazil that have limited material capabilities and leverage    comparatively to great power; they value collective action and multilateral    forums with 'like-minded' partners in similar stance so as to influence international    outcomes. Notwithstanding the fact that Turkey and Brazil's leverage changes    a lot from year to year, Turkey and Brazil will remain an extremely important    'player' in the geopolitical and economic affairs of the Middle East as well    as the broader Mediterranean. Turkey, just as Brazil, wants to have an impact    on global politics. Therefore, it tried to be part of the solution in the disputes    that persist for years in the broader Middle East and the Mediterranean. First    and foremost, Turkey increased its trade and business relations with Arab states    including Iran. Second, it improved its relations with its neighbors by lifting    visa restrictions. Third, it assisted to facilitate and even mediate some of    the region's most disputed issues, trying to broker talks between Iran and the    international community, Pakistan and Afghanistan, Syria and Israel as well    as Fatah and Hamas.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To date, the Turkish    government has not only deteriorated its relations with not only Syria, but    also with Iran owing to its support to the Sunni opposition groups. Moreover,    it did not hesitate to "burned his bridges with the military regime in Egypt,    squabbled with Gulf monarchies for refusing to stand by deposed Egyptian President    Mohamed Morsy, and started a war of words with Israel for having a hand in the    coup that removed Morsy from power". (Aras 2013). Turkey has lost leverage everywhere    in the world due to the Syrian crisis, its relations with its neighbors, and    Gezi Park uprisings in Turkey. On the contrary, Turkey has indeed evolved over    time. Its economic dynamism and geopolitical importance cannot be disregarded.    As a result of its "growing economic diversification and military self-reliance    allows Turkey to exercise greater leverage with the West". (Metais 2013).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand,    Brazil has got leverage over some powers and can influence world issues. Brazil's    Roberto Azevedo has been selected the head of the World Trade Organization (WTO)    as a result of this it is expected that his leadership will remove barriers    'as part of global trade talks' due to its influence over the 'BRICS' that is    composed of five member states, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South    Africa. Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota maintains that this "reflects the    transformation underway in the global order". (Zalewski 2013). Brazil has the    ability to convince and persuade actors to engage because Brazil is more sensitive    to other actors' preferences and it has the ability to present arguments and    ideas in an effective manner.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, Turkey    has engaged with other emerging powers, namely China, Russia and Japan. Turkish    Prime Minister Tayyip Erdo</font><font  size="2">&#287;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">an's    decision to purchase Chinese missile system (CPMEIC's HQ system) over the U.S.    Patriots has created more concern over Turkey's intentions (False Friends: Why    US is getting tough with Turkey 2013). In 2012, the strategic relationship between    China and Turkey had taken off with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping's visit    to Turkey in February, later Turkish Prime Minister Erdo</font><font  size="2">&#287;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">an's    visit to China in April a few months later. The relationship between the two    nations entered a "honeymoon" phase. (China, Turkey to Establish Strategic Cooperative    Relationship 2010). Turkey has steadily increased its trade with China since    the AKP government came to power. Turkish trade with China has increased; exports    to China amounted to $1.43 billion in 2008, and Turkey's imports from China    were $15.6 billion in the same year (Turkey-China Trade Relations Weaken as    Crisis Hits 2009). The two countries' closer relationship not only in the fields    of trade but also culture, tourism, as well as the military has signaled its    willingness to engage with emerging powers. According to Tao Zan, "Turkey's    acceptance as a "dialogue partner" in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization    is not necessarily leading to the establishment of a substantial strategic relationship,    though leaders of both countries have spoken of such a partnership since 2010.    Rather, Turkey's turn to the East is not a strategic shift, but is a way of    keeping a balance between the West and the East. Due to its substantial needs    that the West can provide, from security to technology, Turkey is still anchored    in the West". (Zan 2013). Center for Global Modernization Studies scholar also    argues that "Turkey, China is a potential partner but not an alternative partner    to the West". (<i>idem</i>). Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that    Turkey has engaged with many emerging powers since AKP came to power and this    is sign that AKP wants to engage with new allies and acts careless towards its    former allies concerns. Turkey has also signed a deal with Russia in order to    build its first nuclear facility on Turkish territory. Then, Turkey has signed    another deal with Japan to construct another nuclear facility. But Turkey had    lost the trust of its "strategic partners" or "reliable allies" due to its uncertain    foreign policy. All these new foreign policy decisions have created doubts about    AKP leaderships' intentions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>V. Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Turkish Prime    Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called for a "new global order" based on solidarity    and trust rather than conflict. In practice, however, Turkey has yet to settle    on any definitive vision for that new order beyond expanded representation in    key forums". (Byrant &amp; Hatay 2013, p. 8). Turkey has puzzled countries by    its uncertain foreign policy and most of its former Western allies have lost    trust in Turkey. Davutoglu had proposed an ambitious program before the uprisings    but afterwards his ambition faded away gradually with the unexpected events    especially in Egypt and Syria. AKP's foreign policy, especially after the 'Arab    Spring' or rather 'Dark Arab Winter' has been low key. Nur Bilge Criss has stressed    that "priorities may always have to be re-directed under changing junctures,    but AKP does not seem to have priorities. [...] AKP is merely trying to score    points in foreign policy through populism". (Criss 2010, p. 10). The only priority    AKP seems to have is to stay in power and consequently change the regime in    Turkey. The 2023 vision (AK Party 2012) of the government is to become one of    the emerging powers and seek to be almighty as the Ottoman Empire. AKP identify    themselves as the "conservative-democratic" mass party and their ideology has    its roots in Islam, which was influential in Turkish-Iranian rapprochement.    Supporters of AKP also have played a role in maintaining the relatively positive    relations between Iran and Turkey. Business associations such as the Independent    Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association (MUSIAD) has particularly been    active in improving economic ties with Iran even though there was an UN embargo    on Iran. Turkey has also initiated a nuclear program and signed a contract with    China to buy a missile defense system. This move has confused NATO member states    and the U.S. has lost trust in Turkey's partnership (False Friends: Why US is    getting tough with Turkey 2014).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turkey's political    cooperation with Iran can also be elucidated by its economic interests. Turkey's    effort to avoid sanctions on Iran can be understood as a result of its dependence    on Iran's gas resources. The main reason behind Turkey's objections to sanctions    on Iran is due to protect new business. Similar to Brazil, the reciprocal viewpoint    between Turkey and Iran as partners was based not only on economic objectives,    but also in their political aspirations. All partners aimed to attain more engagement    in international institutions that set the norms and values, where developing    countries could have a voice. Both Turkey and Brazil argued that the political    isolation of Iran would only radicalize its position. In this regard, they renowned    the 2009 elections of Iran as a valid development of the democratic process,    by congratulating the former President Ahmadinejad straight after the elections.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The international    image of Turkey similar to Brazil was viewed as an intermediate power in the    light of its 'soft power', (Tarik 2007) its abilities to persuade and assume    a mediation role as a regional power since Turkey's AKP came to power. For instance,    AKP attempted to seem as credible regional power by making believe it is a democracy.    The internalization of a foreign policy driven by economy (economic interdependence)    rather than national security increased the legitimacy of its role as an intermediate    power. Additionally, Turkey participated actively in the main economic and political    forums as well as regional and multilateral cooperation agreements. Turkey through    its active foreign policy(Davutogly 2013), could make use of multilateral forums    with states of similar capabilities and common interests so as to influence    international outcomes. Despite its limited capabilities and recourses compared    to great powers, Turkey akin to Brazil, demonstrated its readiness to expand    its role and liability with the intensification of regional as well as global    politics. Turkey and Brazil has quite similar ambitions given that they profile    themselves as 'order-setter' intermediate powers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turkey is seeking    to build new alliances with emerging powers in the BRICS. It is trying to improve    its relations with countries like Brazil; those states that have ambition to    play a global role and change the global order. Both countries' objective is    "at launching a new era in political and economic fields". In line with their    mutual goals the two countries also aim to strengthen their cooperation in not    only the economic field but also in the defense industry. (Turkey. Ministry    of Foreign Affairs s.d.).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All these new foreign    policy decisions have created doubts about AKP leaderships' intentions. Particularly,    a military deal with China has worried the NATO member states since Turkey is    a NATO member and has signed the NATO missile defense deal.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

Abstract The emergence of new cultural dynamics, anchored in information and communication technologies, that flourish in the spaces of the city, circulate through digital networks and materialize in cultural and artistic interventions, poses challenges to cultural policies and cultural institutions that no longer have the privilege of defining and setting goals for the creation and uses of art and culture. The present moment demands a non-simplifying understanding of the innumerable representations, contradictions, voices and silences that struggle for visibility in the public arena.

Niklas Luhmann's Theory of Society is frequently accused of being conservative since it neglects the relevance of the structures of inequality in modern society. This article proposes an alternative reading of this theory which implies a reconsideration of the part of the structures of inequality for the reproduction of social systems. The main argument is that the structures of inequality guide the manner with which social systems select individuals for their operations. At the same time, the luhmannian thesis about the superiority of functional differentiation is defended, because while the structures of inequality may vary, assuming contingent strengths whose transformation does not represent the transformations of society, the functional differentiation represents the identity of society, remaining as an invariable and necessary dimension in the horizon of meaning in modern times.

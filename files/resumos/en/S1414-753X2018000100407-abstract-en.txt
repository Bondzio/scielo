Abstract The community gardens seek to ensure the promotion of healthy food and family economy. However, these areas demonstrate a potential for rescuing affective bonds and promoting the collectivity. The objective was to analyze the environmental perception and affections of the community garden program users in a city located in southern Brazil. 14 users were interviewed, mostly retired and over 60 years old. The Affective Maps Generator Tool was adapted to make the affections possible for interpretation. The content analysis found the perception of an environment that facilitates the psychological restoration, mental health, quality of life, environmental interactions, productivity, healthy diet and family economy. The affections experienced were often described with the intention to identify gardens as restorative environments and spaces that promote quality of life, which are important mediators of collectivity and the appropriation of environment.

This paper analyzes the relationship between Brazil and the developing countries during the first post-1964 military government and seeks to explain the riddle behind this foreign policy. There was a remarkable increase in Brazil- Third World relations and their multilateral arrangements, despite the fact that the official speech was riddled with bipolarity and strongly aligned with the United States and the fight against communism. We suggest that the analysis of institutionalized ideas is fundamental to explain this finding.

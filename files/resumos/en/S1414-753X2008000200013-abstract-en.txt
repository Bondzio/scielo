This work aims at analyzing the development of fish farming in the lower region of the SÃ£o Francisco River in the State of Alagoas, Brazil. We interviewed active and inactive fish farmers from this region between March and July 2005. The obtained results show mainly that the level of income can be determining for the development of sustainable and profitable fish farming taking into account that some of the small producers depend on governmental subsidies.

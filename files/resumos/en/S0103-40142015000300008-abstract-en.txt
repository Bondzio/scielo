abstract The discussion on economic growth and employment in Brazil has been stanched by an imported theory based on "natural rates" of employment - an idea developed by Milton Friedman that today pervades economic theory around the world. This mistaken view is imposing upon the country a brutal recession, with rising unemployment and a drop in aggregate production, without showing any sign of success in what it proposes, namely, a metaphysical recoup of credibility on the part of companies. It is actually a matter of political power of a particular social group that today extends beyond political parties.

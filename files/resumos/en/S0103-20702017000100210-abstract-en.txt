Abstract This article analyzes what can be conceived as the decisive moment by Henri Cartier-Bresson, in view of the proliferation of interpretations that the words &#8220;decisive moment&#8221; hold in relation to the concept of the decisive moment coined by him. To investigate the root of this concept, some of his photographs are analyzed in reference to other images from the history of art, such as Van Eyck&#8217;s Arnolfini couple, Willen de Kalf still life and Vermeer&#8217;s paintings as well as photographs by Diane Arbus.

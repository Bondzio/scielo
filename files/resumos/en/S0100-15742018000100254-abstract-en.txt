ABSTRACT: This study reports on initial teacher education in educational policy through the construction of five case studies in the Biob√≠o region, Chile. Three of them with actors involved in training in universities, another with public school teachers, and the last one is a document of the state policy that regulates teacher education processes in Chile. Results show that while universities prioritize knowledge and adjustment to the regulatory framework of national policy, in-service teachers demand to qualify in constructive criticism of state policies and competencies to construct policies together with the State based on their own work experience.

The article presents the context of the foundation of Santa Teresinha School, the oldest private institution of Imperatriz (state of Maranh&#227;o), founded by the Brazilian Capuchin Poor Clares in tune with their Italians spiritual directors. The project was in line with the reform of the Catholic Church and favored its policy to promote faithful adherence and recruit young generations through education. It was the result of a pivotal moment for the religious women: a process of autonomy in their congregation which allowed them to use strategies to expand their work. On the whole, the present study shows that, based on that observation, one can see traces of the construction of an educational network organized by the Church in rural Maranh&#227;o, supplementing the work of the State and setting up elementary schools with religious purposes.

This article deals with women and their reading practices as historically constructed in relations between orality and writing, public and private spaces, in three different moments. First, in ancient times, with the myth of Pandora described by the poet Hesiod and with the Athenian women which Lessa presents as the Melissa Model. We then look at some paintings of different genres and styles - Renaissance, Baroque, Mannerism, Realistic - from the 15th to the 18th century, which represent female readers of the Middle Ages and their ways of reading. The third stage analyses data on the practices of Brazilian readers between 15 and 64 years old, published in the book "Literacy in Brazil" (2004). These three slices show how the relations between orality and writing, public and private spaces stamped the reading practices of women and mobilized them to produce new ways of reading.

Abstract The article aims to reflect on the relationship between values on politics, gender inequalities in social spaces and presence of women in political representation. It focuses on the political culture, the values and implications for political involvement. The first part presents the conceptual and theoretical assumptions underlying research. The second presents survey data and empirical information in order to discuss these mediations. The paper analyzes this relationship in the following vector: values-participation-representation. It explores the argument that distrust and disbelief in politics have an impact on the propensity to women's participation in associative spaces and politics itself. Consequently, on the gender gap in representation. The results suggest contradictory trends in Brazil. Abstract values of democracy are extended, also among women, but confidence in the institutions and data on participation suggest possible impacts on propensity to associative participation and entry into the political representation.

By focusing on women's experiences over a land dispute in the State of Paran√°, I intend to discuss notions of "suffering", as well as analyze what may or may not be reported on the violence experienced or known in the fight for territory. From the stories of Joaquina and Francisca, who lived tragic experiences during the conflict, the notion of "suffering" appears accompanied by different temporal perspectives, which in turn point to distinct perceptions of suffer. In addition, their stories inspire questions about the possibilities of production of testimonies of the violence lived, and about to what extent, in that context, it is possible to denounce the assaults suffered. Finally, I seek to understand how the "posseiros" who lived the struggle for land tell stories about the deaths that occurred during the conflict, which events they highlight and which ones they silence.

Abstract: The present work seeks to describe the representations of gender present in the photographs of women published in the Tic Tac magazine, edited in 1944 in La Araucanía region/Wallmapu, Chile, as part of the imposition of a social, cultural, political and economic hegemonic model of the Chilean State and the groups of power at that time, during the postwar period in La Araucanía.

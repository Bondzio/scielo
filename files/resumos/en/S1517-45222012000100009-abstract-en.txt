This paper aims to analyze and discuss the continuities and improvements of three Latin American fundamental social theories: the theory of transition to modernity as formulated by Gino Germani, the dependency theory developed in the works of Cardoso and Faletto, and the Marginality Theory by Roger Vekeman. In spite of the critiques that point the superseding of these theories, this article will expose new theoretical trends towards the endurance of the Latin American sociological debate initiated in the 20th century. Thus, it is stated that the Systems Theory could reintroduce topics of Germani's contribution through the idea of permanent transition implied in the processes of functional specialization present in both theories. The globalization process, in turn, would update the debate, intrinsic to dependency theory, on national sovereignties and new forms of international subordination. Finally, the theories of social exclusion would arise both continuing and breaking with marginality theories.

Abstract: The paper intends to analyze some of the criticism received bay female stray animals protectors, especially accusations of irrationality, misanthropy and sentimentalism. These accusations are read in the light of ecofeminism and care theory to perceive this kind of protection as an activity of care, mostly developed by women and subjected to sexist criticism. Ecofeminism is mobilized to combat the sexism in question, indicating the potential of animal protection to construct roles other than traditional roles for women.

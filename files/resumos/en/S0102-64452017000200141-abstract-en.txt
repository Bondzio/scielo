Abstract Hannah Arendt and Eric Voegelin discussed about the Totalitarianism and during 1951 changed correspondences. The following year, the letters were published in Review of Politics in review format. Arendt replies to the Voegelin&#8217;s comments and so borns the talk between them. This debate is little-known in Brazil, but despite being small, the debate reveals how both think about the Totalitarianism and other categories of Arendt&#8217;s and Voegelin&#8217;s thought like the &#8220;gnosticism&#8221; for Voegelin and &#8220;plurality&#8221; for Arendt. In the debate the differences of thought are obvious. This difference is manifest when Voegelin questions Arendt on the &#8220;immutability of human nature&#8221;.

Abstract The name jurema is associated with plants, beverages and even specific religions. All these references are based on mystic phenomenon, here found in substantive and historical terms. In this article we will examine uses of jurema contexts relating mainly to indigenous, catimb√≥, umbanda and the postmodern neo-juremeiro psiconautism. Ritual traditions are examined in a processual and dynamic way, showing their cultural meshes. Oppose the traditions of exoteric and esoteric knowledge should also be an effort, especially by the creation of new forms of ritual use of jurema.

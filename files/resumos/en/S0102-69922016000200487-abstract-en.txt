Abstract As every year since 1990, the Human Development Reports (HDRs), commissioned by the United Nations, seek to enter, in the public agenda, a set of actions which involve political leaders, rulers, intellectuals, technicians and civil society organizations. The aim of this paper is to verify, based on some research done in Latin America and disseminated through the proceedings of XXIX Alas Congress that took place in 2013, if, at present, there is indication that it is happening, in fact, the sedimentation of human development processes capable of showing that lasting improvements for people living in poverty are occurring. Although there is no direct dialogue between the reports and surveys examined, it can be stated that they have been produced under a growing interest, in the Social Sciences, to understand whether processes to combat deprivation and powerlessness to which the poorest are submitted in various parts of the world are or not underway.

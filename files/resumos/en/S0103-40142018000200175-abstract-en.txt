Abstract This text aims to readdress the debate on the importance of teaching geography as a school subject in Brazilian basic education. We argue that this school subject plays an important role in shaping the critical thinking of individuals by enabling schoolchildren to understand the spatiality of phenomena so that they can operate geographic knowledge in their daily lives and produce insurgent spatial practices.

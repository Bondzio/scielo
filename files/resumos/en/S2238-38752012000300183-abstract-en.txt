Abstract: In seeking to understand the foundation of the Museum of Art in the context of the Brazilian modernization process in the mid-twentieth century, the pursuit of foreign references in forging the museum has been the obligatory path to the investigations of the institution. The constant references to the Ulm Hochschule für Gestaltung and the inspiration that could have provided the didactic character of the institution can lead to the comparison that I seek to establish in this article. The Hochschule für Gestaltung is seen here as an important reference for the MAM Rio and the pedagogical model established in the first decade of the museum, possibly providing the ground for the specificities that characterized the relationship between the museum and its audience.

Abstract This article discusses contemporary artistic practices that use the aesthetics of identity. The aim is to study the gestural and visual process in which the performance takes place in the broader levels of implementation, how is the documentation as performative device. It is suggested that the performance causes a strain on the social hegemonic order &#8211; binary, in contexts of asymmetries and gender violence. Artistic practices trans and from Latin American activism are analyzed, under a queer perspective (Rosa Blanca, 2011) and decolonial (Walter Mignolo, 2003).

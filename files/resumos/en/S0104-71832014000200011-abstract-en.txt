This article addresses issues related to working with the network of child care, particularly with kaiowá indigenous children in situations of "vulnerability." In cities of Mato Grosso do Sul has been frequent cases where kaiowá children taken from their kingroups and conducted to urban shelters. The research was conducted based on the ethnographic method, interviews and survey data were also made along the virtual search sites. The objective of this paper is to discuss the process of victimization suffered by indigenous children who are sheltered. Of the results obtained enabled us to observe the ambiguities and contradictions in the representations of the care on the network Indians: Indigenous children are seen as double victims (children and victims for being victims because they belong to indigenous culture) and adults as "criminals "(drunk and lazy).

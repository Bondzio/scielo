Abstract In this paper, I examine some mechanisms that make the existence of climate-chance science possible, as this is an extremely heterogeneous field of science virtually composed of members of all scientific disciplines. I examine the role played by the two main mechanisms of homogenisation described in the Science and Technology Studies (STS) literature: translation (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987) and standardisation (Latour, 1987; Jasanoff &amp; Wynne, 1998; Star &amp; Lampland, 2009; Edwards, 2010). Translation consists of the process through which a group of actors make the interests of other members of a sociotechnical network converge with theirs. Standardization consists of the development of standardised concepts, practices, measurements, instruments, methods, and techniques of research, so that heterogeneity is reduced in a given field of science. I argue that these mechanisms are central for understanding the connections developed between different groups of experts and the flow of information in climate-change science. A process of translation has made the interests of a number of actors converge with those of general circulation modellers. Standardisation techniques, on the other hand, have made feeding - although not without problems - data collected across the globe using a wide range of techniques, instruments, and methods of research, into GCMs possible.

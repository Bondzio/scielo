Abstract The family has been linked to both the success and the failure of children at school and also identified as a stimulating source of productivity and school adjustment. It has also been identified as a source of discouragement and devaluation of education. This study investigated the expectations and the conception of parental support among 97 fathers of first grade children in a public school in Florianopolis. The instruments selected for data collection were an interview with two open questions and a sociodemographic questionnaire. This research, anchored in a data collection method which is descriptive, exploratory and uses a qualitative approach, has shown that both fathers and mothers emphasise cognitive development and offer resources to help children reach positive academic performance.

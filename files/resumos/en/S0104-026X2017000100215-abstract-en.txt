Abstract: While women&#8217;s labor force participation rates have increased in Brazil, unpaid care responsibilities remain unequally divided between mothers and fathers. Based on an original, representative survey of 700 mothers and fathers of young children in low-income neighborhoods in SÃ£o Paulo, this article examines the gender differences in labor force participation, and its relationship to access to child care and family caregiving responsibilities. The analysis concludes that work-family conflicts and responsibility for children fall disproportionately on mothers, regardless of whether they prefer to remain active in the labor market or not. Policies that promote paternal and state co-responsibility are essential to reduce this conflict.

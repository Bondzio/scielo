Mar√≠a Lugones is a renowned Argentinian feminist philosopher. She is a Ph.D. in philosophy and political science from the University of Wisconsin, USA. Her commitment to the Women of Color in the United States began in the 1960s, and was influenced by the liberation struggles of the black civil rights movement. This brief essay is aimed at tackling &#45;in terms of "pilgrimage"&#45; some of the most important concepts and systems of categories coined by Lugones, as from two of fundamental texts. In addition, I analyze how the potentialities and limits for political coalition of the identity of Women of Color, may contribute to non&#45;white Latin American feminist praxis in specific contexts.

Econometric models were developed to estimate the implicit prices for selected quality attributes of fresh peaches commercialized in the state of Sao Paulo. Such estimation is conducted in two stages of the distribution chain, namely, wholesale and retail sales. Data on the price and quality attributes (such as color, size, varieties and types of damages) of fresh peaches were obtained from cross-sectional data in different time periods. The estimation of Hedonic Prices is proposed as a method to evaluate post-harvest price variations from wholesale to retail sales. The results obtained allowed us to identify the gains accrued in each stage, deriving from the improvement in the product quality attributes.

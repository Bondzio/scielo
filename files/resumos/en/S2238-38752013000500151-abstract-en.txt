Abstract This article discusses some significant concepts for the understanding of David Harvey's works. It focuses on three specific theoretical constructions based on the ideas of spatial fix, new imperialism and accumulation by dispossession. It also addresses what might be called Harvey's critical theory. It is argued that to understand Harvey's ideas properly it is necessary to situate them within his studies on cities.

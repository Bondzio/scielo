Building upon this simple concept, the article discusses the idea of innovation, presented as both a result and a process, and highlights its comprehensiveness and the complexity of effectively creating new realities. It shows that the idea of innovation did not appear for the first time in the 20th century, as it is often assumed, but dates back to Antiquity. The article analyzes the historical transformation of innovation&#8217;s value, which changed from a reprehensible heresy to a desirable feature during the 19th century.

This paper identifies and analyzes the different types of revisionist politics, and its levels, developed by progressive governments in South America toward the United States over the past 13 years. For such, it uses as starting points concepts that are fundamental for better understanding the behavior of South American countries in relation with the great power: "peripheral revisionism," by Cesar Guimar√£es, and "autonomous confrontation" and "antagonistic confrontation," both by Helio Jaguaribe. From the developments of these concepts, a theoretical model was developed with different types of peripheral revisionisms, which allowed for fine-tuning the classifications of foreign policies in the period.

Abstract Electrical energy is the basis of the lifestyle of contemporary society, whose main source in Brazil, is the dam, requiring the construction of major infrastructure projects. These projects drive contradictory social and political processes. In these processes, we glimpse the conflict between the Specific Purpose Entities (SPE), proponents of hydropower, and the Touched, representative parts of local populations forcibly displaced as a result of these works Movement of Affected by Dams. Having locus as the basin of Uruguay, southern Brazil, this article discusses the conflict through a "loop analysis" consists of hydropower and resettlement. We sought to understand the frequency and the motivations of those affected to participate politically in later demonstrations against their relocation hydropower. Therefore, we use a methodology that links qualitative and quantitative tools based on empirical research. The study enables us to understand that the primary motivator for participation of those affected in later for their resettlement mobilizations is human solidarity.

A presentation of the main results and discussions of a study case carried out in Kalunga territory (built up by former slaves&acute;descendants) on the situation and prospects of fair trade in that site, based on the experiment developed by the Kalunga Fair Market enterprise (KMJ), in the small town of Cavalcante (GO). Here are some of the results we can point out: a) The Kalungas are below poverty level, being part of them below destitution level; b) It&acute;s necessary to find alternatives to generate income for community survival; c) KMJ is an enterprise focused on market economy and is far from being a fair trade experience or ethical solidary trade; d) KMJ poses an alternative for the commercialization of Kalunga products and the relationship set up by the enterprise provides a significant increase of the family income; e) The challenge for the building-up of a new model to organize production, distribution and consumption of socially produced goods, as well as the exercise of alternative experiments can indeed be faced by the Kalungas, provided they have the support of public policies which, universal as they are, don&acute;t fail to regard the unique features of their ethnic group.

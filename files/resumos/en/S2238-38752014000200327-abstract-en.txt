Abstract The purpose of the article is to suggest a different perspective from which to analyze itineraries of therapeutic care, using the concepts of itineration and meshwork, taken from the work of Tim Ingold. To do so, it is necessary to review Ingold's concepts and his relational perspective, beginning with the notions of obviation and transversality of fields, as well as itineration and meshworks of entangled lines of life. The aim of the article is not to do full justice to Ingold's thought, but rather to use some of his concepts that may bring new light to the question of therapeutic itineraries.

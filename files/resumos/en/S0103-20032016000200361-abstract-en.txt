Abstract: This study aims to determine the degree of knowledge and adherence of family farmers of rural settlement Chapadinha, in Sobradinho (DF), to organic production regulations established in Brazil. The research methodology used included open interviews that intended to assess the perceptions and knowledge of the producers on the most important regulations for organic production in Brazil: Law 10831/2003, Decree 6323/2007 and the Normative Instruction 46/2011; these standards had been integrated into three units of analysis: guidelines of systems and production, marketing processes and control mechanisms. The paper points out that the documentation is the biggest bottleneck in smallholder certification process, as these requirements are complex, and there is less training related to the proper understanding of these documents. In relation to the marketing process and control mechanisms it was identified that the producers have a degree of incomplete knowledge related to some of the rules of the parameters related to these aspects, damaging time for certification, requiring greater technical guidance and monitoring.

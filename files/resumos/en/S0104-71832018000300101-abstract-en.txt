Abstract This article aims at analyse the actions in the public space of social movements based on a dynamic relation between politics and religion. The election of catholic Pope Francis gave birth to new ways of political and religious activism, that we focalise in the Movement &#8216;Misioneros de Francisco&#8217; (Francis&#8217; Missionaries&#8217;). From an ethnographic perspective, this article identifies three privileged ways of being in the public space: the activism in the square, in the neighbourhood and in the street, and studies the ways of action and the disputes and issues towards the political and ecclesiastical institutions presents in the territory.

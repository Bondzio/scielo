The article analyses the transformation process introduced into basic secondary schools in Cuba that handle students who are in the 7th, 8th and 9th grades. Searching for solutions for the problems that were affecting these schools, in 2001, a group of teachers from all the countries Institutos Superiores Pedagógicos - Schools of Education - implemented a complete generalist teachers training, that made them able for teaching all disciplines, except English and Physical Education to groups of 15 students. The study focuses the complete generalist teachers training as part of the on going movement for universalizing graduate high level education, which restructures the Institutos Superiores Pedagógicos and basic schools nationwide, considering these ones as though they were mini-universities. The methodology of the study is based on a qualitative ethnographic approach and founded upon references supplied by Marli André. In this particular area, the research works of Carlos Rojas Arce and Lisardo García Ramis stand out, constituting the basis of the present investigation.

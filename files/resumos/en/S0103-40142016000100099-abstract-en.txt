Complementary and integrative health practices gradually became a reality in the public health care network across the country. Their use in the National Health System deserves reflection, especially when investigating the effects of their adoption in Brazil, a complex society that has incorporated increasingly sophisticated and expensive technological resources. This advance can be understood as an expression of a movement identified with new ways of learning and practicing health care, since integrative practices are characterized by interdisciplinarity and by specific languages that are opposed to the high-tech vision of health that prevails in the market society, dominated by health plans whose overriding purposes are to generate profit and to fragment the patient's treatment into specialty areas that do not take into account the totality of the human being seeking a remedy for their ills.

Abstract: The political philosophy and the social philosophy have recently been confronted with normative challenges that require significant efforts in trying to respond them. Among them one is the vertiginous process of depoliticisation of the public sphere. It undermines the social life. From the point of view of critical research it is necessary to propose answers to this problem. Based on critical and reflexive thinking, this article aims to make explicit the solidarity social action of participatory budgeting as possibility to solve the depoliticisation of public sphere. In this sense, the project of deliberative budgeting can contribute to society through repoliticizing action in the public sphere insofar as it functions as a social-normative medium in the society.

Abstract: This article analyses Brazilian criminal procedures regarding human trafficking for sexual exploitation. The sources of research are 12 &#8220;cases&#8221; investigated/judged within 1995 and 2012. The methodology proposed is thought through feminist epistemologies. &#8220;Gender&#8221;, &#8220;discursivity&#8221; and &#8220;subjectivation processes&#8221; are the analytical categories. This research shows how police practices to combat &#8220;human trafficking&#8221; have became a technique to fight prostitution and the prostitutes themselves.

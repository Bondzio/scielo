Abstract In Limits to capital, David Harvey updates and interprets the work of Karl Marx through a type of reconstitution of the criticism of political economy. His later interventions in a series of political and theoretical debates were often fed by this work. His participation in the dispute about the post-modernity in conversation with JÃ¼rgen Habermas and Fredric Jameson gave him growing public acknowledgement since then. About a decade after his publication of The condition of post-modernity, Harvey reshaped his diagnose of the historical present. In The new imperialism, he focuses on the new order postulated by the North-American State's reaction to the attacks of September 11th of 2001. To qualify the debate, he made an effort to reestablish the conceptual and the historical determinations of the Marxist theory of the Imperialism.

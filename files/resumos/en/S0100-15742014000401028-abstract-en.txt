This essay focuses on the theoretical weakness of Brazilian educational research, deploying its argument in three sections. Based on Bernardete Gatti assessment, the text outlines in the first section some difficulties and limitations of the current stage of educational research. The second section deals with the core aspect of the ambiguity of ordinary, scientific and philosophic experience. It intends to show that, although such forms were accompanied by dogmatic trends, they also embody open and multiple conceptions. The final section presents the Gadamerian hermeneutic experience as a promising approach to broaden the notion of human experience and a potential new perspective on the nature of educational research.

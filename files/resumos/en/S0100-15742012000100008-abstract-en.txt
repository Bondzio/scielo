Are there educational policies in support of beginning teachers in Brazil? In order to answer this question, we took into account data collected by a research on teacher policies in Brazil, which included 15 case studies in five states and 10 municipalities of the country. Data collection procedures consisted of document analysis and visits to the sites where interviews were conducted with those managers or administrators in charge of the implementation of teacher policies. Research results showed that in two states and one municipality, there were teacher training activities by the time of examination entry in the carrier. In two municipalities we could identify true policies to support beginning teachers as part of a policy of continuing education. Research data also revealed three programs aiming at to approximate university and school and to promote the insertion in teaching: Pibid, proposed by Capes/MEC, a Federal action, Literacy scholarship, a state of São Paulo initiative, and a student teacher scholarship from the Education Department of the municipality of Jundiaí. These initiatives are very recent, but very promising in the attempt to reduce the problems faced by beginning teachers.

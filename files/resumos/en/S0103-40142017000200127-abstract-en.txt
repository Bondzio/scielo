ABSTRACT Intrapreneurship has attracted the attention of researchers and scholars around the world, especially in the last two decades. Most of these studies are conducted in private companies because of the intrinsic competitive nature of their environment. In the public sector, however, studies on intrapreneurship are still scarce or at very early stages. The public environment, however, urgently needs an intrapreneurial strategy that encourages the acceptance of risks, responsibilities and challenges, eliminating the excess of formalism. Therefore, the focus of this article is to study the intrapreneurial practices of a federal research institution, as well as the main barriers to having an intrapreneurial management in this organization. To achieve this goal, an applied, exploratory and descriptive research was carried out, with a qualitative approach and a case study. As a result, it was possible to verify that the main practices used in the organization are linked to greater employee autonomy, financial and non-pecuniary rewards, limited time in one position and tolerance to errors. In addition, the difficulties in this process are presented, with red tape and adherence to norms and regulations being the main obstacles to intrapreneurship.

Abstract This paper presents a analysis of the body as a territory of politics, practices and social representations concerning the regulamentation of its reproductive functions. The bodily dimension of male sterilization as a contraceptive alternative allows us to understand the sterilization as part but &#8211; not reduced to &#8211; its biological content. Thus, this reproductive choice is build in connection with an existing sexual and gender order, which puts in evidence different values, uses and attributions regarding male and female bodies.

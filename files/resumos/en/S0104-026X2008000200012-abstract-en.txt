This article observes the diverse expressions of sexual encounters, seduction and eroticism in the North of Chile. The study was realized using the Sexual Scripts theory. We interviewed 46 men and women from 18 through 69 years of age from the cities of Antofagasta and Calama. The main conclusions reveal that the construction of the sexual scripts is reinforced by the sociocultural inequitable models and predominant gender relationships in the Chilean society, especially in that area, where mining is the most important economic activity. Moreover, in the lower socioeconomic levels we can find elements associated with the most traditional models, whereas sexual scripts with more flexible and equitable elements are found in higher socioeconomic strata.

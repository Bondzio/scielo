Abstract: Based in &#8220;stories&#8221; extracted from the common knowledge, this text reveals the paths of the popular culture and its transformation into Popular Culture. A process based on the popular education and on the political activism in the Sixties, mainly within the Brazilian rural world; and the formation process that leads a popular culture activist to build an academic career on anthropology. In the history and memory of the Basic Education Movement (MEB) and the Popular Culture Movements (MCPs) as social transformation movements through popular culture and popular education, the ways experienced on the understanding of anthropology as a political issue are exposed in order to experience anthropology as scientific reason. It is the statement of someone who, at first, served as a political activist and a teacher upon a Popular Culture Movement (The Basic Education Movement) and who, only years later, has become an anthropologist, who still believes in the role of the anthropology, culture and education as social transformation practices.

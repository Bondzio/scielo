AbstractThe main objective of this paper is to identify variables that could explain the virtuous public-private relationship pattern on the production of public policies related to the industrial policy during the first Lula government round. The central argument of this research is that the National Industrial Development Council (CNDI), under the surveillance of the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC), has been acknowledged as a legitimized locus of the policy agenda building. Such processes resulted from two political factors: (i) the influence of neo-developmentalism ideas, especially those ones which influenced a new industrial policy, and (ii) the action of political entrepreneurs. The research was based on the analysis of the internal dynamics functionality of the National Council for Industrial Development (CNDI). The central question is if this collegiate worked as the real locus of political agenda. The available data were obtained through the assessment of the official registers, document analysis and interviews with the involved actors. One of the findings was that the established relationships and the formation of the policy agenda on the board contributed to the whole definition of the industrial policy in that period. The second finding was that the role of political entrepreneurs and neo-developmentalist ideologies contributed to facilitate such a dynamics. This article helps to understand the dynamics of tripartite forum of public policies in democratic context, its apparent causes, its positive results and its frustrations.

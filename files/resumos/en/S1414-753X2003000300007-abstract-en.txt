The article discusses the dominant position of sustainability discourse in the debate on environmental issues and its implications on education . It understands that the current debate on sustainability has mainly been guided by economic and technological proposals that follow market's imperatives. The author, however, argues that this market-guided sustainability is not able to answer to challenges placed by the multidimensional crisis that we face nowadays. He also considers that education plays a relevant role in this search for social sustainability since it can surpass the influences of market pragmatism that tend to reduce it to economic needs.

Not all of them are   completely regulated by the international refugee regime and at times there are   clashes between the spheres of their legal competences. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A regime, for Krasner (1982, 185&#150;86) is formed by   principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures. As to the RSD   procedure, it differs from one state to another, being sometimes complex and   sometimes simple. In industrialized countries, for instance, the UNHCR local   office and NGOs do not usually have a key role in taking decisions regarding   the refugee status, whereas in developing countries, the UNHCR local offices   and NGOs have usually different roles, mainly because the UNHCR is able only to   determine who is a (mandate) refugee, but not who is a state refugee. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This paper is about the RSD procedures, not about the   entire regime. The guidelines for determining refugee status come from the 2005   UNHCR Handbook on Procedural Standards for Refugee Status Determination under   the UNHCR's Mandate (UNHCR 2005), which is an instrument or guide in the   process. Hence, a proposal to change the procedures comes together with, and is   a result of, the proposal to change the roles of all partners who are   responsible, in different ways and places, for applying those guidelines. The   solution proposed here is the formation of a network society composed of all of   these partners and based on a dialogical model inspired by communicative   action. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After providing an overview of the current RSD   procedures, mainly as it relates to refugee claimants, applied on an individual   basis that they must undergo to achieve refugee status within a host country,   this paper describes the current general procedures for RSD established by the   2005 Handbook and discusses the roles of the implementing partners.   Regrettably, the lack of standard rules concerning the roles of each partner in   the process leads to a lack of coordination in their functions, duplicates some   activities, and creates gaps in others. Useful practices do exist, though   partners sometimes do not work in "real partnership," but instead in an   adversarial way, due to conflicts of interests among them. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, in order to create a coordinated system in   which all partners are legally bound by international laws and principles,   mainly administrative ones, this paper suggests a network society communicative   model by having all implementing partners gather at "round tables" to speak and   be heard, and to have their own realities and needs be considered. The UNHCR's   responsibility for protection should be better focused by building standard   rules, principles and decision-making procedures to be followed by all   partners, under organized domains and by educating and training implementing   partners and opinion-makers to disseminate, lato sensu<i>,</i> the international   refugee regime, and, stricto sensu<i>,</i> a fair RSD procedure, as well as by periodically examining their roles,   conducting local, regional, and international meetings to share knowledge and   practices found in different realities.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The current Refugee Status Determination: general   procedures</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The current international refugee regime was created   in 1951 as a response to the forced displacement of people after World War II,   to provide protection to those in need of physical and economic security and   social well-being, under the support of the Office of the UNHCR, which provides   policies, guidelines, and legal rules for implementing durable solutions for   these vulnerable people. Yet during the RSD procedure, difficulties are   encountered in the application of the definition, the implementation of the   solutions, and in the observation of the procedural standards.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol defined   refugees, and the procedures to determine refugee status are expected to adhere   to these definitions. However, the current reality and regional differences   lead each state and region to adjust the international and general rules to its   own needs, creating a lack of standard rules and a failure to implement   policies for refugee integration in host countries. For this reason, some   refugees' human rights are not observed.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">General global rules created by the 1951 Convention   and the 1967 Protocol to protect refugees and refugee claimants do not   specifically outline the stages of the RSD procedures and the roles of the   implementing partners. Hence, it was necessary to standardize the procedures   for the RSD worldwide in order to avoid discrepancies among different regions   and realities, which could culminate in human rights violations, e.g. a lack of   work permits and access to health care, or even in <i>refoulement</i> to the persecuting country.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hence, the Office of the UNHCR published the   Procedural Standards for RSD under UNHCR's Mandate in 2005 because protection   is a core UNHCR function and also "to provide guidance on UNHCR procedures to   determine eligibility for mandate refugee status on an individual basis" (UNHCR   2005, 1). The individual procedure may be conducted by a local government, by   the UNHCR, and/or by local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in   partnership with the local government or the UNHCR local office, though there   are some differences among states' practices. Some steps are common to   procedures in every country: the claimant's arrival, written application form   completed presenting all reasons for the claim, interview, gathering of details   about the country of origin, decision with reasons given, administrative   review, and right to judicial review. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to establishing general standard   procedures for determining refugee status (including the provision of physical   facilities and office security, reception, registration, adjudication, and   ruling on claims), the Handbook also defines the rights, obligations, and   responsibilities of UNHCR offices and, rarely, of implementing partners.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, in practice, the Handbook does not   provide details on the roles of each of the implementing partners. This leads   to gaps in their roles and the inefficient and ineffective protection of   refugee claimants in many places. In general, the Handbook gives UNHCR local   offices the right to implement the procedures according to their own reality,   which is sometimes useful and necessary, but lack of supervision and comparison   with other offices at times leads to poor RSD procedures and decisions, which   negatively affect refugee claimants' lives. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Pestre (2007, 157, 389&#150;91, 449), the negative   effects include delayed decisions, fear of <i>refoulement</i>,   bad outcomes of poor interviews conducted by unprepared officers and lack of   necessary information. Pestre (2007, 147&#150;57) also observed some difficulties   and unsuitable consequences encountered when claimants are traumatized during   interviews, such as by remembering past events, being interviewed in an insensitive   manner, or having difficulty being understood by interpreters. These problems   indicate a need to re-evaluate and change the current RSD procedural rules and   guidelines. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some guidelines for change in order to achieve a fast,   fair, effective, efficient, and final RSD procedure are suggested in Showler   and Maytree (2009, 9&#150;13), who affirm that the Canadian government should   minimize the steps in the process, make the first decision the best one, have   competent and independent decision-makers, manage the case load, let the   claimant tell his or her story, facilitate access to legal representation, and   invest in good mechanisms to achieve objective country of origin information.   This shows how the Handbook has been interpreted differently in different locations:   even Canada, well-known as a host country receptive to refugees and refugee   claimants, has found difficulties in dealing with the standard procedures   presented by the UNHCR. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The procedures may not be absolutely standardized or   global, while generalization can lead to a lack of application. However, it is   important to analyze each partner's roles, how each implements the UNHCR   procedures and the cooperation among them. Each partner cooperating for a   better way to accomplish fair, fast, and reliable RSD procedures should   consider its own reality, while following some standard procedures,   particularly concerning its roles and the claimants' protection. The Handbook   fails to establish these individual roles, producing confusion among the roles   each partner has to follow locally, for which reason in many countries the RSD   procedure does not achieve its goal of protecting claimants from human rights   violations.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Refugee Status Determination: implementing partners</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas everyone has the right to seek and enjoy in   other countries asylum from persecution (article 14 of the UN Universal   Declaration of Human Rights), states have the sovereign power to bar people   from entering their territories. This means that people have the right to   leave, but not to enter, which creates a paradox between the right of   individuals to claim refugee status versus the right of sovereigns states to   close their borders. These difficulties have increased for the RSD procedures   mainly because of the increased global tensions triggered by the attacks of   September 11, 2001.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">States have to protect their citizens and abide by   international agreements based on humanitarian principles. The problem is how   to reach equilibrium between the rights of states and those of individuals as   well as how to deal with different implementing partners that have different   interests. The task is to re-organize each domain, that is, the role of   implementing partners, as Hardy (1994) suggests, and develop a collaborative   organized domain.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to   protect refugee claimants, governments, NGOs, refugees, and the UNHCR need to   interact with one another and to get along among themselves. Hardy (1994,   280&#150;82) considers refugee systems, i.e. an established or organized procedure   (RSD procedures are part of the system and the focus of this paper), in general   to be under organized domains, since "interactions within and between   stakeholder groups are complex because both collaboration and conflict occurs."   For Hardy (1994, 289), a domain is under-organized if it is "characterised   either by a lack of consensus around the legitimate stakeholders and/or a lack   of common values."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While states insist on their sovereignty, NGOs, even   if dependent on the former, push them to guarantee respect for human rights and   to legislate accordingly. Additionally, world events, the media, public   opinion, and complex legal systems manifest contradictions that "serve to   render refugee systems under organised domains", according to Hardy (1994).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When it comes to the refugee claimant procedure, ab   initio, it is necessary to identify the implementing partners and to legitimize   their roles and common goals. That is, claimants must be treated according to   international human rights principles and law. To achieve this goal, a   collaborative and consensual structure must be built that is legally supported   by public policy, so that it can withstand the constant changes in world   society.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary implementing partner is the UNHCR, which   undertakes its functions by interpreting and applying the RSD procedures it   created. By listening to governments, NGOs, refugees, scholarly research, and   its own staff, the UNHCR is responsible for preparing and publishing   principles, norms, rules, guidelines, and procedures that will later become   domestic laws in each country. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Handbook (UNHCR 2005) presents core standards for   due process in mandate RSD, for instance, appropriate access to UNHCR staff and   procedures, non-discrimination, transparency, fairness, efficiency, time   limits, impartiality, and qualified staff. However, nothing is said about   partners, particularly how these standards may be implemented by the latter,   considering regional realities, different qualifications, goals, and values.   The guidelines are detailed and cover all of the issues, but they do not   mention who does what, what adjustments may be made, and who provides training,   to achieve a standard mandate in processes such as registration, document   reception, evidence gathering, interviewing, decision-making, and notification. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to exercise its functions, the UNHCR needs to   be recognized legally by states due to the sovereignty principle that   determines that states are free to admit or not anyone (individual or legal   person) into their own territory. For this reason, the UNHCR, as a UN body,   should act as the umbrella agency responsible for creating the RSD procedures   and supervising its implementation, by educating its partners, and by   organizing collaboration among them, instead of going to the frontline and   taking on responsibilities that should be delegated to others. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second implementing partner are the states, which   need to attain equilibrium between the exercise of their sovereignty, through   border control for collective and individual security reasons, and their   commitments to human rights, through international treaties internalized into   domestic law. It is not sufficient to ratify an international treaty. States   must match international obligations with domestic interests.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within the international refugee regime, though the   RSD procedures are not binding rules or norms, states are bound by   international conventions such as the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol and   Human Rights Conventions, thereby making them responsible for building policies   for their implementation. For Tazreiter (2004, 7), "refugee policy &#91;of a state&#93;   also reveals aspects of the core values of a state, which immigration policy   per se does not reveal."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In relation to refugee claimants, local governments   that accept a claim should be in constant vigilance to comply with their   international obligations, mainly because refugee claimants require special   attention due to their vulnerability. However, states sometimes forget this and   institutionalize a complex top-down system, mentioned by Clark (1985) and by   Suzy (apud Buchwald 1991), without considering access to local resources, the   refugee claimant's needs, and local partnership with, for instance, NGOs based   locally. In addition, lack of standardization of the UNHCR RSD procedure leads   to an under-organized system, which fails to protect refugee claimants.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The leading role of the government is unquestioned,   but no state is able to act alone when dealing with waves of traumatized people   who fear persecution, lack family and cultural identity, and also face cultural   and language differences. Hence, some states delegate several duties to local   NGOs (Egypt), others leave their task in the hands of the local UNHCR offices   (some Asian states) and others share the task between local NGOs and the   government (Brazil and Canada). This lack of standardization makes it difficult   to protect claimants' human rights, to follow the UNHCR RSD procedure   guidelines as well as to implement standard RSD procedural rules or guides to   be pursued by all implementing partners, mainly those that operate locally and,   for that reason, better know the local region. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirdly, there are Non-Governmental Organizations   (NGOs). Indeed, refugee claimants are in need of shelter, physically and   mentally, and local governments do not always have enough resources to deal   with these issues or to implement the UNHCR procedures. Hence, a close   relationship with local NGOs needs to be established, financially or   politically. Some agreements are made directly between UNHCR and NGOs,   independent of governments, allowing NGOs to act independently from local   governments, yet following the UNHCR's guidelines as to fairness and   impartiality. Nevertheless, state sovereignty over the NGOs' legal operation   within the country must be observed. For Tazreiter (2004, 16), "NGOs have been   pivotal in the proliferation and efficacy of the universalisation of human   rights." For Castells (1997, 352), they "are the most powerful proactive,   mobilising factor in informational politics."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">NGOs may protect refugee claimants' human rights   independently, by pressuring governments or by gathering media and public   support, or by formal collaboration with local governments and/or local UNHCR   offices. Their roles are to conduct both advocacy and/or service delivery, for   instance, by providing legal aid, language and culture courses, and access to   health care. Additionally, local NGOs are able to identify local partners, as   happens in Brazil (through Caritas) and Canada (through the Canadian Council   for Refugees). However, it must be reminded that local NGOs and the UNHCR local   offices need legal permission from local governments to operate within a   territory, as well as the ability to be more involved in implementing the RSD   procedures. If government policy changes, states may withdraw previously   granted permission, even if this means that the government would need to   compensate the recipient for having broken an agreement. In case a government   closes a local UNHCR office, international political sanctions may be imposed,   such as exclusion and loss of seats in international organizations. This is   why, in general, states collaborate with the local UNHCR office by facilitating   its job and building partnerships with it and with local NGOs.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding the last implementing partners, refugees and   refugee claimants, some NGOs have useful support from refugees and former   refugees (current citizens) working in different functions. This is important   when dealing with claimants from the same country, that is, those with the same   culture and needs. Furthermore, refugees (not refugee claimants who usually   have not yet achieved their regular legal status in the country) have also been   recognized as legitimate partners in the eyes of government, not only in   developed countries, such as the UK and Canada, but also in developing   countries, such as Brazil and Egypt, where refugees become active by getting   the media support to struggle for rights, particularly through NGOs dealing   with refugees' rights, as insisted by Harrell-Bond (2010).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To be a legitimate partner means to have legal status   within a country and, hence, access to the media, to legal aid, and to   protection, all this related to the RSD procedures. As stressed by Harrell-Bond   (2010, 12), "a new global infrastructure for the protection of refugees" is   necessary. However, Tazreiter (2004, 55) emphasizes that unlike refugees, a   refugee claimant "is a voiceless individual in a country in which s/he has no   membership claim and yet wishes to claim protection."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pestre (2007, 20), by indirectly agreeing with   Tazreiter (2004, 7), claims that states usually forget the claimants' real   situation and submit them to the legal-administrative state machinery that does   not have, and is not interested in developing, the psychotherapeutic competence   to deal with them. Tazreiter (2004, 53) insists that an ideal RSD system (i.e.   procedures) "is challenged and called into question by the everyday realities   of the physical, legal and psychological needs" of claimants during the   determination process. Indeed, immigration officers, who are the first contact   with claimants, should have deeper knowledge of psychic disturbances. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Refugee claimants (not only refugees) also need to be   engaged in daily activities, in order to overcome trauma, disturbing memories   and, sometimes, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The lack of support and system   institutionalization (a top-down system created without considering their needs   and wishes) make claimants suffer from the dependency syndrome (whereby they   are physically protected and psychologically unprotected). According to Suzy (apud   Buchwald), the best therapy is to include them in community activities and to   remove unnecessary obstacles in order to increase the refugee's participation,   which assists in strengthening his or her self-esteem and self-confidence and   in reducing feelings of isolation, depression, and dependency.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Considering that each partner has its own values and   interests, but also the same goals as the others (to protect those making   refugee claims), due to the non-adversarial character of the RSD system (apart   from the level of appeal), it is expected that they treat each other fairly,   despite the unbalanced power relations among them&#151;states are legally the most   powerful, while refugees are the least powerful, and NGOs act as mediators. The   UNHCR seems to be the umbrella of the system, gathering information from each   partner, talking with them separately or together, proposing international   rules, guidelines, principles, and procedures, encouraging states to adjust   their domestic law to the international regime, lato sensu, and to the RSD   procedures guidelines, stricto sensu, and advocating for an equitable network   society. Regrettably, positive results are not always reached.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Refugee Status Determination practice</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some different practices have been developed due to lack   of standardized rules and, hence, there have been failures in implementing the   RSD procedures in different parts of the world. However, some successful   examples of achievements are also highlighted.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Global Consultations on International Protection   Report (2001, 9&#150;50) issued some recommendations that were included in the   Handbook (UNHCR 2005). Though they sometimes exist only on paper, they would be   useful for building more humane RSD procedures that could be considered a "best   practice." The recommendations include the following suggestions: standard   rules and basic guiding principles be applied; domestic legislation on refugees   be introduced that is compatible with the international refugee regime; fast,   single, prompt, efficient, and confidential core decision-making procedures be   adopted; guidance, legal advice and counsel, personal interviews, and   opportunities to present evidence be provided; states create a sole and central   specialized decision-making authority, which operates with accurate, impartial,   sensitive, flexible, and up-to-date Country of Origin Information from a   variety of sources; and that written decisions be issued automatically, and the   right to an independent appeal or review of a negative decision be assured. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These recommendations are merely principles that are   currently implemented differently in different countries, as indicated by the   examples below. Expected results are not always achieved because of the lack of   standardized procedures and measures. According to the Handbook (UNHCR 2005)   and to Alexander (1999, 283&#150;87), once a claim is made, it is expected that a   fair hearing (i.e. hear the other side) be conducted, physical and human   resources be allocated properly (i.e. fast and effective processes be followed   to avoid errors that can have life-long consequences for refugee claimants, as   well as adequate physical facilities for their reception and for conducting RSD   procedures), institutional integrity be shown, and a fair and open process   applied. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, institutional integrity, for Alexander   (1999, 286), requires that the local system (i.e. ways of implementing the RSD   procedures) be open, reasonable, workable, and consistent. Full disclosure or   publicity (i.e. written decisions with clear reasons) and efficiency (i.e.   backlog cases avoidance) are principles of administrative law that should be   considered by UNHCR staff and all implementing partners handling claimants. Not   only must hearings be fair and open, but the whole procedure must be supported   by physical and human resources that are well established within a system based   on cultural integrity. The combination of these elements is the basis of a fair   and open process for refugee claimants. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Alexander (1999, 286&#150;87), and according to the   Handbook (UNHCR 2005), a fair and open process requires the publication of   rules and guidelines, standardized and clear written information, free access   to legal advice and representation, access to files, and an impartial body to   decide appeals. A fair procedure should be followed by all implementing   partners to protect claimants' basic human rights, such as life, liberty, equal   treatment, and equity.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some NGOs provide good examples of what should be done   to protect refugee claimants. In Brazil, Caritas has an agreement with the   UNHCR local office and the federal government to conduct the first interview   and to send a written assessment to the National Committee for Refugees   (Conare), i.e. a collective deliberation body within the Brazilian Ministry of   Justice (Art. 11, Act 9474/1997). Accordingly, Caritas also seeks to integrate   refugee claimants to society, by giving them advice on how to get work permits   and find a job, register for Portuguese and academic courses, and get financial   aid, housing, and health care.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alexander (1999, 288&#150;89) refers to an international   NGO called the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS), whose branch in Cambodia provides   general assistance to claimants and refugees as a result of an agreement with   the UNHCR, including funds for financial, housing, medical, and any emergency   assistance. JRS assists them with lawyers who prepare, present, defend, and   request reopening their cases to the UNHCR. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This kind of professional legal aid, regardless   whether it comes from lawyers or paralegal representatives, has a high positive   impact on claims and is part of the procedural standards for RSD, as prescribed   by the Handbook (UNHCR 2005, 4.3.3). Unfortunately, the Handbook does not   require legal representatives and decision-makers to have a background in   psychology. A legal knowledge is not enough to prepare individuals to conduct   interviews with profound implications for the lives of vulnerable and   traumatized people.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Legal aid has to be individual, confidential, private,   and specific to each case, due to the unique nature of each refugee claimant.   According to Pestre (2007, 143&#150;71, 342), states aggravate the trauma and   disturbances suffered by claimants in several situations: prolonging the pain   of waiting (by public services and processes that contribute to the uncertainty   and insecurity of waiting for a decision) and compulsory interviews (in which   claimants must relive painful conflicts that they wish to forget, because they   have hurt them and could again, when, in fact, states should have mechanisms to   avoid situations capable of aggravating trauma). States, by focusing on   categorizing each individual based on his or her medical and legal conditions,   recognize the individual as a victim of persecution or of trauma who deserves   access to rights; if not characterized as a victim, the person will not be   recognized to have the right to refugee status and may be forced to leave. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Additionally, the UNHCR should assist governments and   local NGOs to ensure that legal representatives are experts in refugee law and   provide them with specific training. This does not mean they should require   that the refugee's legal aid be a lawyer or be regulated domestically. Yet,   under UNHCR's assistance and coordination, local governments might consider   evaluating competence before conferring authorization for someone to act as   claimants' legal representative. Procedural rules and guidelines built and   implemented with the aim at preventing errors and avoiding backlogs would save   time and money. Kagan (2006b, 4) affirms that the UNHCR should facilitate basic   protection, fill gaps left by governments, and reduce its own activities by   motivating governments and local NGOs to provide protection for claimants. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, the current RSD procedures have several   failures, which lead to human rights violations and cause problems for host   states, the UNHCR, NGOs, refugees, and claimants. These failures have several   causes, such as lack of physical structure, lack of legally and psychologically   trained human resources to apply RSD procedures, limited financial resources,   the failure to take into account regional differences when implementing the RSD   procedures, and lack of a legally-binding committee on international refugee   law, as there is in the international human rights law sphere. Although it is   not easy, these issues should be addressed to help adjust the current RSD   procedures and assist claimants to achieve legal status in the host country   through domestic procedures. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All of these recommendations are designed to protect   refugees and claimants both internationally (through international obligations   taken by states) and domestically (through fair, fast, and efficient procedural   rules). According to Kagan (2006, 4), "UNHCR RSD facilitates protection for   refugees in three main ways: promoting the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>,   assisting in the promotion of durable solutions, and identifying refugees in   need of social and economic assistance." </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For claimants, protection should focus on avoiding <i>refoulement</i> (i.e.   forcible return to the country of persecution, according to Article 33, &para; 1 of the   1951 Convention) and on promoting and implementing human rights as a way to   attain integration, which is a first step to attaining legal citizenship and a   sense of belonging. Isin (2002, 15) and Nyers (2004, 26) affirm that after   being recognized as citizens, structural difficulties can be transformed to   allow refugees to avoid, or at least to reduce, the risk and insecurity of   being negatively labeled as criminals, transmit disease, and increase   unemployment in the host community. Hence, the responsibility for implementing   solutions should be shared by all implementing partners, in a clear and   dialogical way that considers each regional reality and the implementing   partners' aims in order to re-organize the RSD procedures and, therefore,   optimize it and protect refugees and claimants' human rights.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Network Society Communicative Model</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To optimize the role of each implementing partner in   better RSD procedures, a network society communicative model could be used. It   would be built by gathering ideas from Castells, Habermas, Apel, Chimni, and   Betts. Castells (1997, 2000) affirms that a <i>network     society</i> is the best available social model. Habermas (1989)   maintains that <i>communicative     action theory</i> is the most valuable one, while Apel (1997) favors a <i>communication and argumentation</i> community. Chimni (2001), meanwhile, prefers using a <i>dialogical model</i>, and Betts (2006) suggests <i>interconnections</i> in global governance. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If Castells' ideas were to be applied to the   international refugee regime, particularly to the RSD procedures, all partners   would be linked as nodes of a net, with different roles, but united for the   same goal, which is refugee and refugee claimant protection under the   international human rights regime in general. In this case, the UNHCR would be   responsible for educating and training public servants and NGO staff for this   purpose and for promoting standard RSD procedures among all implementing   partners, mainly the importance of organizing the partners' roles and their   domains.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal of Habermas (1989) is a world where all live   together in a democracy without violence or exploitation. To achieve this goal   he proposes <i>communicative     action</i> (social integration) focused on mutual understanding. He   understands that communication is only successful if it produces a consensus   among all partners ("speakers") about the meaning of the transmitted messages.   He defends a <i>universal     discursive ethics</i> as a method to resolve conflicts. In short, he   selects three basic rules for his ethics of communicative reason: inclusion   (individuals linguistically able to express themselves are included in negotiations   and allowed to speak), participation (all speakers have the right to express   themselves, to act, and to be treated equally) and communication free from   violence and coercion. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With respect to the RSD procedures, all implementing   partners, especially refugees and claimants, might be allowed to express   opinions and to provide input into discussions about the process, considering   refugees' and claimants' cultural background as well as state sovereignty. The   UNHCR might act to change partners' positions through a bottom-up education and   training program for public, private, and third sector actors, by teaching them   a new way to apply moral rules for refugees and claimants.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Apel (1997), apud Velasco (2001, 62&#150;74), favors <i>a communication and argumentation   community</i> to solve humanity's conflicts, which he affirms are mainly   due to cultural relativism and diversity problems caused by globalization.   While recognizing that an ideal communication community does not yet exist, he   maintains that a real community is sufficient for initiating an attempt to   build a universal solidarity ethics, which culminates in consensus and mutual   understanding among all people, based on individual freedom to make decisions,   build consensus, and work. According to Apel, apud Carbonari (n.d.), only human   desires that can be universalized through an agreement based on rational   arguments, whose aim is the formation of will based on solidarity, are   ethically relevant. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Until this time, due to conflicts that surge from   globalization, the formation of the community envisioned by Apel is not   possible, but, in terms of the RSD procedures, the UNHCR has the power and   capability to educate and train all implementing partners to reciprocally   recognize one another as partners in a discussion with equal communicating   rights. These implementing partners must be aware of the dangerous outcomes of   lack of responsibility, solidarity, and universal rules in favor of standard   consensual procedures, particularly that related to procedures for handling claimants   and assuring their protection. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chimni (2001, 152&#150;68) affirms that he has a new <i>dialogical model</i> for   reforming the current international refugee regime. However, the focus here is   only the RSD procedures<i>.</i> He maintains that dialogue should take place among all partners on a continuous   and institutionalized basis, and should be based on democratic principles. It   should be between states; among NGOs, academics, and the UNHCR; within the   UNHCR; and between NGOs and governments. This implies a network society,   adapted for the refugees and claimants' needs, stricto sensu, and for the   international community, lato sensu: "&#91;i&#93;n conducting the dialogue these actors   must of course ensure that they do not always speak on behalf of, but in   conversation with, refugees."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instead of focusing on what changes should be made,   Chimni proposes new ways of achieving changes in a dialogical model. He claims   that, due to regional differences, inter-regional dialogue should come first   (2001, 156&#150;58). He also affirms that NGOs can play a key role by publishing and   circulating reports "to persuade States to negotiate with each other with   respect to finding innovative solutions to the global refugee problem" (2001,   162&#150;63). For him, while the dialogue between civil society (NGOs and academia)   and the UNHCR should be transparent, it is essentially a dialogue between UNHCR   divisions and a long-term pattern plan (2001, 160&#150;62). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In general, he favors a dialogical model (process of   argumentation) among all implementing partners in order to transform state   interests and identities, mainly those involving shared responsibilities   &#91;North-South relations related to burden sharing&#93;, education, and people   mobilization (2001, 164). Again, even considering regional peculiarities (i.e.   each region has its own RSD procedures), education, and training are at the top   of the proposed model for change.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Betts also presents his own model for a better refugee   protection, by conceptualizing <i>interconnections     in global governance</i>, that is, that "refugee protection is interconnected with migration, security, development,   peace-building, and human rights and these interconnections have significant   implications for the politics of protection," built by the international   refugee regime, organizations, ideas, and identities, of which RSD procedures   are a part (2007, 11&#150;16).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hence, dialogue is   the keyword for a network society communicative model. The way to organize the   implementing partners' domains and optimize the RSD procedures is through a   bottom-up educational and training programme, which should be supported,   coordinated, and monitored by the UNHCR, in which dialogue is established among   all implementing partners, thus building a network of negotiations. Regardless   of the terminology chosen, what matters is that all implementing partners be   allowed to negotiate effectively among each other, considering their own   importance within the RSD procedures, which should be better organized in order   to "build bridges instead of walls." </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Network Society   Communicative Model has been applied successfully by the International   Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), through its several programmes and   activities worldwide. With regards to education and training, for instance, the   ICRC is a valuable model, as it deals with similar issues as the UNHCR and has   developed useful practices that might also be developed by UNHCR: official and   in-depth information, assistance to avoid the dependence syndrome and to foster   self-sustainability, humanitarian diplomacy, development of links with the   private sector, and education in International Humanitarian Law among military   and civil servants, decision-makers, opinion-makers, and students, as a   prevention policy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A useful way to   persuade governments and private bodies to follow their rules is by educating   them. For optimized RSD procedures, Kagan (2006b, 13) declares that "&#91;the&#93;   UNHCR's most explicit authority is to promote, facilitate, and assist refugee   protection by others, principally among governments," as well as by local NGOs,   instead of doing the frontline work without enough resources. It is important   to educate and pressure implementing partners to determine a refugee status   based on humanitarian grounds, to avoid <i>refoulement</i>, to fully implement the 1951 Convention and to   advocate for fast, fair, efficient, and impartial internal procedures.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kagan (2006b,   17&#150;18) adds that "&#91;the&#93; UNHCR's publications make clear that &#91;...&#93; individual RSD   requires significant staffing, time, and facilities when it is conducted   fairly." Given that "refugees &#91;and refugee claimants&#93; also need education,   social security, shelter, health care, and other services &#91;basic human rights&#93;   that impose costs on a state," states usually ignore their responsibilities,   which undermines protection. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Suggestions and recommendations</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ideal RSD   procedures should establish procedural standards for UNHCR and for governments,   though Kagan emphasizes that "&#91;the&#93; UNHCR's interests are less adverse to   refugee claims than those of governments. &#91;The&#93; UNHCR was established to protect   refugees, while governments might be interested in migration control and   restricting access to asylum" (2006b, 19). Therefore, the UNHCR needs to   strengthen its moral authority and to persuade governments and private entities   to obey the international refugee regime, though the focal points here are the   RSD procedures. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although sovereign   states are in crisis, losing power, wealth, and information to other entities   such as NGOs and private transnational companies, they are still the most   powerful actors in international society. Castells affirms that we live in a   network society, "made of markets, networks, individuals, and strategic   organisations" (1997, 355&#150;59). Power "is diffused in a global network of   wealth, power, information, and images &#91;...&#93;. Yet, it does not disappear. <i>Power still     rules society; it still shapes, and dominates</i>."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In short, power is   distributed and decentralized among all subjects of this new network society,   formed by states, NGOs, transnational firms, and individuals (refugees and   claimants in this case). Yet, in practice, sovereign states remain dedicated to   protecting themselves from unwanted foreigners, mainly refugees and refugee   claimants, who suffer from trauma, bureaucratic delays that impede integration,   lack of just, fair, and fast RSD procedures, lack of adequate public policies   for dealing with claimants while awaiting decisions, and human rights   violations, including absence of the right to work, health care or education.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The UNHCR,   meanwhile, conducts some of the same activities as the ICRC, but not enough to   achieve success. It does not publish essential and in-depth reports with   information needed by the media, NGOs, academics, and government officers, to   advocate for the RSD procedure standards and guidelines to monitor   international protection for refugees and refugee claimants. Open workshops,   especially in places where there are large numbers of urban refugees and   claimants threatened with deportation, <i>refoulement</i> or detention, should be conducted on a regular basis, providing refugee and   claimants a chance to be heard and have their human rights protected.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The establishment   of dialogue among all implementing partners&#151;refugees and claimants included&#151;,   the training of decision-makers, and the provision of educational programmes   coordinated by the UNHCR should be mid-term solutions for building RSD   procedures, particularly its administrative and judicial procedures, based on   the promotion, protection, and implementation of human rights in a   collaborative society where all partners are in regular and constant dialogue   and are treated equally.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The current   international refugee regime, created in 1951, needs legal change, mainly for   refugee claimants and in the RSD procedures, including legal representation, hearing   design, time limits, and the reorganization of the implementing   partners' roles. Refugees and claimants have been legally protected by a   theoretical regime implemented by the UNHCR, by states, and by NGOs. Yet,   International Refugee Law has not been fully applied in practice, mainly those   procedures used to deal with claimants.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Procedures taken to decide a claim should be fast,   fair (i.e. hearing and open process), effective, impartial, public, and   efficient (i.e. in a reasonable time), hence, based on minimal principles of   administrative and natural law, in a safe and well-equipped institution, and   conducted by trained decision-makers, according to Alexander (1999, 283&#150;87) and   Wade and Forsyth (2009, 371&#150;75, 328&#150;48), already mentioned, in order to preserve   refugee claimant's human rights (i.e. due process with an appeal or review   mechanism, <i>non-refoulement</i>,   human dignity, and institutional integrity) and to guide the RSD procedures.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For instance, the Canadian Law has been applying fair   hearings since the Singh Case (1985), by allowing a claimant an oral hearing   during the first phase of the procedure. Unfortunately, no appeal division on   the merits, with right to oral hearings, for claimants has been implemented   yet. It does not mean that lack of oral hearing is the same as unfair   procedure. Other jurisdictions, like Australia, do not have oral hearings in   the first instance, but they have them in the appeal level and are recognized as   fair procedures.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, there is a huge gap between theory and   practice, which sometimes leads to human rights violations against claimants   who, for instance, do not automatically have a right to work, to education or   to health care, and often remain without means to provide for themselves. This   leads to the dependence syndrome, which affects their own life, the local   society, and the government, due to the fact that they need the assistance of   government, the UNHCR, and NGOs, instead of having an opportunity to work and   act according to their own skills.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This paper maintains that the current situation can be   changed by reorganizing the domain in which all implementing partners act. The   UNHCR, states, NGOs, and refugees should have their rights and duties clearly   established, considering regional realities. Standard procedures for RSD should   be created and implemented for each and every partner. General customary law   and principles of natural justice above mentioned should be emphasized. This   can be achieved by giving all partners a chance to speak and to be heard in a   "round table" format where all participants are treated equally and have an   opportunity to express their wishes, needs, and situation. They must all be   provided options to follow new steps.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Handbook published by the UNHCR in 2005 is a   useful tool. There are examples of countries where it has been adjusted to the   local reality with positive outcomes for claimants, in one or more aspects,   such as Brazil and Canada. However, many needs will only be met when the   implementing partners are aware of their own responsibilities, which should be   determined and monitored on a regular basis by the UNHCR, whose central aim is   to promote the international refugee regime as a whole. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whereas states should act as local partners, by   providing physical and human resources&#151;who can be educated, trained, monitored,   and evaluated by UNHCR officers&#151;, NGOs and their staffs should be legally and   psychologically prepared to assist refugees and claimants, and should be the   UNHCR's partners by implementing the RSD procedures and being politically   active in persuading governments to promote and implement them. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The UNHCR, as the global   coordinator of this regime, should remain central to the RSD procedures and be   aware of its particular goal in the education, training, and the establishment   of clear rights and responsibilities for all partners, based on the   implementation of a network society communicative model, even depending   financially on states (i.e. states' interests drive the UNHCR's actions). The   ICRC is a useful example of an independent and politically neutral   international organization (i.e. it does not receive financial aid from states   and does not take part in conflicts) that does a good job of promoting   International Humanitarian Law among states, NGOs, security forces, teachers,   and researchers by listening to them and educating and facilitating their roles   as partners, in order to find better ways to develop and implement the system.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bibliographic references</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ALEXANDER, M.

Abstract This article addresses material aspects of religious services and campaigns connected to the missionary activities of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. The text focuses on action developed in the sending country instead of encounters in the missionary field. In doing so, the article aims at investigating how abstract Christian missionary and diaconal obligations become concrete and tangible ritual productions, through the mobilisation of a set of liturgical elements. The text takes these practices as part of the process of negotiating otherness at issue in the Protestant missionary endeavor. The analysis of a few rituals observed during the ethnographic research in the Netherlands intends to show how the mobilisation of these varied elements materialise some abstract aspects of missionary obligations, rendering them accessible to the Protestant subjects.

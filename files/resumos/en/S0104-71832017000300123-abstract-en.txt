Abstract: This article presents a depiction of the situation of contemporary investigations in Anthropology and Education in Argentina. Three articulated aspects are considered for displaying the analysis. Firstly, it ponders the conditions of possibility for the production of knowledge regarding the policies of Science and Technic, in the context of the political and economic transformations of the country. Then, it refers to the formation of three important research departments in Anthropology and Education, later on constituted as a Network. The main themes and theoretical-methodological approaches shared by this Network are pointed out, considering their common history. Finally, it includes an issue that has begun to be developed more significantly in recent years, and which also gives account of the growth of the production of knowledge in this field: the contributions produced by these investigations for the analysis and development of the teaching of anthropology.

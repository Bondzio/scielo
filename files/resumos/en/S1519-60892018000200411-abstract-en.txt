Abstract: This article joins the literature examining children's contribution to small farmers&#8217; economy in Brazil by describing how children from the lower Tapajós region contribute to their parents&#8217; work in crop fields, domestic chores, hunting and fishing. Tapajós children, who also attend part-time school, acquire traditional knowledge and locally valued skills through their participation in these activities. My interlocutors associate this learning process with the idea of &#8220;getting used to&#8221; (se acostumar) and I show, in accordance with other studies, that this process implies long-time observation and progressive participation in adult's activities. In the conclusion, I insist that going through this process allows the persons to appropriate the local way of life and stay in these communities, if they want to.

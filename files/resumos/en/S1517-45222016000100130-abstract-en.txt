This article explores some of the metatheoretical foundations of the social sciences. Over and against structural, structuralist and situationist approaches that stress the downwards causation of structures on agency, it brings the causal power of culture to the fore and forges a comprehensive articulation between culture and action. Drawing on critical realism, hermeneutics and anti-utilitarianism, the article systematically argues for a "view from within" that can disclose how symbols, norms and expressions regulate social actions that can transform social structures. In this sense, the exploration of the internal connection between culture and social agency links social action not so much to social order as to social change.

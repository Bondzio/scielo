Abstract It has been pointed out how the studies of Roberto Schwarz about Machado de Assis have a dialectical point of view, which emphasizes contradictions present in Brazilian society. This analysis has stimulated controversy. I defend that such a literary criticism was inspired by some works of Brazilian social sciences. Beyond the criticÂ´s interpretation of his country, the article aims to show how tensions are present in his own interpretation of the Nineteenth century novelist. More important, I defend that this type of explanation regarding ideas has advantages, what is particularly the case in a moment where the contradictions, which make up societies, are no longer being perceived.

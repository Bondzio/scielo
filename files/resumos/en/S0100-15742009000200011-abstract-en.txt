This study analyzed 27 Ph.D dissertations and master's theses from Brazilian graduate programs in education that use the social representation theory to study representations of or about teachers. For this analysis, principally methodological aspects related to the use of SRT were used, such as: description of the research subjects and the variables selected for this characterization; description of the research object, its contextualization and justification as an object of social representation; procedures adopted for data collection, their suitability and justification; data treatment; analysis procedures; results summary and their contribution towards education, teacher education programs and SRT. It was concluded that SRT has received little attention from researchers, although generally speaking these studies have contributed to clarifying the representations that teachers have about the different fields that constitute their professional life.

The matter was considered an illegal practice violating cooperative principles and defrauding labor laws. The objective of the article is to understand the expansion of this phenomenon, supported by a chronological reconstruction of the facts, the identification of historical moments aiming to provide a legal framework based on concrete cases involving the Labor Justice and the Public Ministry. Qualitative research allowed the identification of four moments: since the appearance of the first cases, until the punishments of the higher education institutions who adopted this contractual system.

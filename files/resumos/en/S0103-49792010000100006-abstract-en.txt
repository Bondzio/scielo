To approach the problematic of production, crossed with social and economic aspects, in the territory of the Metropolitan Area of the City of Buenos Aires (in Spanish, ZMCBA) Methodology: The methodological way goes through the contextual presentation, continues in an analytical way, in territorial and thematic terms. The language develops itself around two main concepts: Production and Poverty. Both notions open broad and distinct lines for reflection and interpretation, most more or less compared. We will present a perspective of both "concepts" and will examine the possible relations that may be established between them. It ends with a series of suggestions that may serve as a trigger of new works or of possible concrete actions to better the lives of the inhabitants of the poorer areas.

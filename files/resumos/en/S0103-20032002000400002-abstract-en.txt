Coffee producer cooperatives need to have a capital structure coherent with their associates' objectives and administered to maintain the organizations competitiveness. For this, it is important that the cooperatives financial sections strategies lead to the creation of a financial surplus to pay creditors, assist the associates, and provide the cooperative a financial return. Using the Logit model, our study evaluates both the financial strategies employed by coffee producer cooperatives in the state of Minas Gerais to maximize surpluses and the influence of different financial indicators on the occurrence or non-occurrence of these surpluses. It was verified that the analyzed cooperatives business strategies concentrate on the management of sales and that the occurrence or non-occurrence of surpluses was explained by asset turnover and the profitability of sales.

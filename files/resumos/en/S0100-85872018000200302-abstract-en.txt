Abstract: The present article traces some threads that weave the intellectual trajectory of Pierre Sanchis (1928-2018), an outstanding Franco-Brazilian anthropologist from the studies of religion. Taking as a guide a speech of his, at the end of the homage that was made to him at UFMG, on the occasion of the granting of the title of professor emeritus (1999), the article presents some landscapes that have marked this trajectory. His birth and childhood between two cultures, Catalan and French, and the incidence of this dual identity on his existence and his thinking. His migration to Brazil, his return to Europe to complete his education in anthropology, and back to Brazil. Family, friends, research institutions (ISER and ACSRM) and their articulations between affection and knowledge. Religion as life and as a scientific research topic. Anthropology as a vocation and as a task. Politics as the management of multiple identities. The article concludes discoursing the dualities and their articulations: Brazil and religion, Catholicism and negritude, culture and identity.

ABSTRACT The Zika virus crisis, like of all diseases, is an indicator of the inequality that persists in Brazil, even after decades of democracy. Zika illustrates disparity not only in terms of class, and a variety of other issues linked to class, but also of gender and race. Ethical issues related to the Zika virus also have different impacts in terms of reproductive choices, the use of chemicals for spraying, and the development of genetically-modified mosquitoes. By using a multi-disciplinary set of methods based on history, anthropology, and eco-epidemiology, the authors show how the current Zika crisis is part of the long history of health in Brazil, with often-tense relations between agents of the State and the population at-large.

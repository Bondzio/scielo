Abstract To reflect on the continuity of subordination processes and expropriation of the traditional populations the article will be anchored in the approaches the paradigm modernity-coloniality. It will try to connect the theoretical problem thus constructed with the empirical knowledge of territorial changes occurred in the Amazon region, a move that will submit to question certain aspects of social reality and to turn the spiral connecting conceptual abstraction and reality. To do it the analysis undertaken here makes use of two field studies conducted in different Amazonian spaces; the first carried out in the western region of Par√°, which over the last decade has been the locus of intense conflict between the fronts of economic expansion and traditional populations. The second held in the Raposa Serra do Sol, which is a paradigmatic case whereupon the judgment put in opposition rationalities different and modes of use, significance and appropriation of territory.

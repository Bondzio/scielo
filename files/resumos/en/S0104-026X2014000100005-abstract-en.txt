Culturally the southwestern region of Mato Grosso is diverse, which can be attributed to the existence of migrant populations and traditional communities. The aim of this case study is to discuss the organization of rural women in southwestern Mato Grosso, who get their salary and help to increase family income through sustainable harvesting of native fruits of the cerrado (the savannah). The money obtained by women is expressive and has contributed significantly to the survival of the family group, as well as for the recognition of their work force and citizenship. However, public policies need to be adjusted in order to enhance the work of women in the production and reproduction of the rural family and its social contribution to regional development.

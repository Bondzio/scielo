Specifically, it analyses the case    of the greatest Brazilian mango and grape exported region - the Petrolina-Juazeiro    (P-J). The conceptual background consists of two approaches. The first conceptual    framework is the Global Value Chain (GVC) approach which is mainly concerned    with the entry of local economies, from developing countries, into the global    market. The second approach is the dynamic capability which is mainly concerned    with the way the firm could acquire capabilities. The method selected for the    empirical part was the multiple-case studies which were made viable by means    of semi-structured questionnaires conducted with mango and grape producer agents    from P-J Region in Brazil and European buyers. This study indicates that some    institutions have been supporting the export activities in terms of irrigation    techniques, new techniques of cultivation, financial support and the introduction    of some certificates such as EurepGap. Lastly, the mango and grape producers    have been undertaking upgrading of product, process and functional.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Key-words:</b>    Global chain; upgrading; capabilities.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O objetivo deste    artigo foi identificar os elementos que contribuem para a entrada de pequenos    e m&eacute;dios produtores no mercado global. Especificamente foi analisado    o caso da maior regi&atilde;o brasileira exportadora de manga e uva in natura,    a de Petrolina (PE) e Juazeiro (BA). Os aportes te&oacute;ricos utilizados neste    artigo foram: cadeia de valor global e capacita&ccedil;&otilde;es din&acirc;micas.    O m&eacute;todo selecionado para a realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o da parte emp&iacute;rica    foi o estudo de casos m&uacute;ltiplos. Para a coleta de dados, foram elaborados    question&aacute;rios semi-estruturados e realizadas entrevistas presenciais    com produtores de manga e uva, associa&ccedil;&otilde;es de produtores, institui&ccedil;&otilde;es    de apoio localizadas em Petrolina e Juazeiro e compradores europeus de manga    e uva. O estudo indicou que algumas institui&ccedil;&otilde;es v&ecirc;m apoiando    o desenvolvimento da regi&atilde;o no que tange as exporta&ccedil;&otilde;es    de manga e uva principalmente transferindo conhecimento sobre padr&otilde;es    de qualidade dos mercados consumidores internacionais.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palavras-chave:</b>    cadeia de valor; upgrading; capacita&ccedil;&otilde;es.    <br>   <b>Classifica&ccedil;&atilde;o JEL:</b> Q17.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>1. Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In general one    of the main tendencies in global agriculture is the exclusion of small and medium    producers from the global market (GARCIA &amp; POOLE, 2004; VORLEY, 2003) Some    elements have been contributing to this process such as the concentration of    retail sector and the huge increase in quality requirements in developed countries.    These impose high costs for small and medium producers in order to meet the    requirements (VORLEY, 2003). Therefore, it is important to identify the agents    and actions which could support the entry of small and medium producers into    the external market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these terms    some questions raised. The first one is: How could local producers acquire capabilities    for meeting the requirements of the external market? The second one is: What    kind of agents and institutions are involved in this process? The third one    is: What kind of upgrading the local producers could carry out? And finally:    When producers are organized in networks how do they acquire capabilities?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this paper two    approaches are used to investigate the case of the largest Brazilian mango and    grape exported region, the Petrolina-Juazeiro region located in the Northeast    of Brazil. The first one is the Global Value Chain whose main concern is the    entry of small and medium producers into the global market and the investigation    of some aspects of this phenomenon such as governance, the level and kind of    upgrading undertaking by local producers and the importance of institutions    supporting the actions of small and medium producers (GEREFFI, 1999; HUMPHREY;    SCHMITZ, 2000).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second one    is the Dynamic Capabilities approach which is in the field of strategic management    and the main concern is to understand the sources of competitive advantage.    Three elements are fundamental in this approach. The first one is the routines    of the firm. Through its routines the firm could achieve competitive advantage.    The second point is the history of the firm, called path dependency. The third    point is the importance of the environment affecting the firm activities. The    firm must adapt its internal and external skills in line with the environment    changes (TEECE, PISANO, 1994; TEECE, PISANO, SCHUEN, 1997, WINTER, 2005). This    paper is structured in five parts. The first one presents the two approaches    used to explain the phenomenon, Global Value Chain and Dynamic Capabilities    and the relations between them in order to analyse the empirical part followed    by methodology section. The third part shows the main European Union requirements    for the import of fresh fruits and the explanation about Petrolina-Juazeiro    region. After this we present the methodology, the Integrated Fruit System,    the description of relationships between PJ producers and European buyers, the    discussion of results, and conclusion.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>2.

In this approach it is important to consider some elements such as    the governance power from different sectors which constitute the production    chain, the challenges of local agents in order to meet the requirements of the    global market and the concept of upgrading and value chain.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Kaplinsky,    Morris (2001) a production chain could be called value chain. A value chain</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">describes the      full range of activities which are required to bring a product or service      from conception, through the different phases of production (involving a combination      of physical transformation and the input of various producer services), delivery      to final consumers, and final disposal after use (KAPLINSKY &amp; MORRIS,      2001, p.4).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this article,    a value chain is formed by input industry agents, producer agents, industry    agents (responsible by the transformation of the product), distributive agents    and the final consumer. Each agent is responsible for adding value to the final    product. Then, the final product conditions depend on the action of each agent.    Moreover, the relations between agents are usually unequal and some agents have    more power than others. Nowadays, in most food production chains the retail    agents are driving activities of other segments and define patterns for other    agents in some food chains (DOLAN &amp; HUMPHREY, 2000; REARDON et al, 2003).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concept of    upgrading is related to the idea of innovation, according to Schumpeter. For    him, innovation may be interpreted as new consumer goods, the production or    transport methods, the exploration of new markets, and new forms of industrial    organization. As for Humphrey, Schmitz (2000), innovation can be called <i>upgrading</i>,    that is, it consists of making products in a more efficient way, adding value    to products, making goods and processes more sophisticated. Also, according    to the authors, <i>upgrading</i> can be of three types. Firstly, process, when    reorganizing the production system or when using a new technique, this causes    the process to be more efficient; Secondly, product, deriving from the manufacture    of products with higher added value; and finally, functional, deriving from    new functions that the firm may have along the chain, such as <i>design</i>    or <i>marketing</i>. Having in mind the <i>upgrade</i> idea, Humphrey, Schmitz    (2000) introduce the importance of organizations or clusters of organizations    in developing countries of being inserted into global markets. According to    the authors, the insertion of these organizations in the international context    depends on the <i>upgrading</i> they have attained. This innovation may be directly    related to the global norms that have encouraged local systems to adapt to the    new specifications. However, for innovation to happen it is also fundamental    to create a set of rules in the local environment to encourage it. This set    of rules may be set by public initiative, private or both. This set of rules    is denominated governance, and public and private governance play a fundamental    role for fostering local conditions for fostering <i>upgrade</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concept of    governance is linked to the agents' power in the value chain. According to Humphrey,    Schmitz (2000, p. 20), the term governance express "that some firms in the chain    set and/or enforce the parameters under which others in the chain operate".    According to Gereffi (1999), when the buyer exerts a certain control over the    chain, that is, determining certain rules for other agents to act, this is called    "<i>buyer driven</i>" governance (HUMPHREY &amp; SCHMITZ, 2001; SCHMITZ &amp;    KNORRINGA, 2000).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GVC have been    used to investigate different cases of producers from developing country in    their action into the external market such as garment industry (GEREFFI, 1998),    fresh fruit and vegetables (DOLAN &amp; HUMPHREY, 2000) the production and exports    of leather shoes in Brazil (SCHMITZ, 1998). Besides, there are some studies    about networks and cooperation and the entry of network of producers, such as    clusters, into the global market (SCHMITZ, 1998; SAUV&Eacute;E, 2001; LAZZARINI    et al, 2001; ZYLBERSZTAJN &amp; NADALINI, 2007). However, the aim of this study    is just identify the main requirements of European markets and some actions    undertake by producers in PJ in order to meet these requirements.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2.2 Dynamic    Capability Approach</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This approach is    part of the field of strategic management and the main concern is to understand    the sources of competitive advantage. Capabilities "emphasizes the key role    of strategic management in appropriately adapting, integrating, and re-configuring    internal and external organizational skills, resources, and functional competences    towards changing environment" (TEECE &amp; PISANO, 1994). The term dynamic is    linked to the environment which is changing all the time. The firm must be dynamic    in order to adjust.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are some    elements which contribute to determine the dynamic capabilities of the firm    and consequently its competitive advantage. They are processes, positions and    paths. The first one is the routines of the firm, the ways that the processes    are conducted, such as the managerial and organizational processes. The second    element, positions, is linked to business assets which encompass the plant,    equipment, and relational aspects. The third element is the path which involves    the history of the firm and its background. Indeed, the author points out the    importance of the firm history. Each firm has some history and in this process    they can learn and accumulate some knowledge. This background is fundamental    to determining the competitive position of the firm in the present and future,    called path dependency (DAVID, 2007). For this paper it is necessary to underline    the importance of the routines as a way of learning. The second aspect is the    importance of internal and external capabilities. The external capabilities    could be acquired through the relationships between firms and suppliers, buyers,    and institutions. In addition to this, some routines attributed to local or    regional factors could support and influence the firms in the early stages (TEECE    &amp; PISANO, 1994; LALL, 1992). According to Lundvall (1992) the firm could    acquire knowledge through its surroundings.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this paper,    the main idea is to relate the concepts of capabilities and upgrading. Based    on the literature presented, the capabilities are divided in two groups, technical    and market. The first implies all the knowledge of the firm about how to produce    and to meet the requirements imposed by certificates such as EurepGap. This    one is related to process and product upgrading. The market capabilities involve    the knowledge about new markets and the action in other segment of the value    chain. This one can be related to the functional and inter-sector upgrading    (TEECE, PISANO &amp; SCHUEN, 1997). It is important to point out that the focus    of GVC is the chain and the entry of producers from developing countries into    the global market. In the case of DC the main concern is the management of the    firm and their action.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>3. Method</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The field research    is based on secondary and primary data. The secondary data was obtained from    reports of research conducted in the Petrolina-Juazeiro region about fresh fruit    production and exports, articles and data base about trade flow. Regarding the    primary data it was used a qualitative approach and the method selected was    the multiple-case studies (YIN, 2001; EISENHARDT, 1989). It is investigated    the production segment of two fresh fruits, mango and grape. The multiple-case    studies method was made viable by means of semi-structured questionnaires conducted    with mango and grape producer agents from Petrolina-Juazeiro region (P-J) in    Brazil and European mango and grape buyers located in the United Kingdom, the    Netherlands and the Germany. The primary data was collected in 2004 and 2005,    and it was conducted in depth-interviews with 11 European importers of fresh    fruit from Brazil located in Germany, England and Netherlands. It was also interviewed    English wholesalers located in Spitafields one of the biggest fresh fruit trade    market in London. In Brazil, it was carried out in depth-interviews with 16    experts (research institutions, association of producers and exporters, and    producers). The interviews were conducted with individual firms based on the    literatures previously reviewed. The categories of analysis considered on this    study are: the routines for acquiring capabilities, path dependency which is    related to the learning process of the organization and its history, and the    environment which refers to the links to institutions and other agents.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>4. European    requirements for fresh fruit imports</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Vorley    (2003) in the process of the retail sector concentration it is possible to point    out some elements such as: absolute costs and barriers to entry for competitors    are rising; own label branding; supply relationships with preferred suppliers    and increasing in requirements such as certificates.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As was said in    the previous paragraph one of the main strategies of supermarket sector is to    keep close relations with a small number of suppliers. In this process they    transfer a group of activities to suppliers such as packaging, transport, labeling,    promotions in the shops, etc. Besides, the supermarkets indicate the price and    have flexibility because they do not have to produce. From the view of producers    there are two important perspectives. From the first perspective it is difficult    to get benefits from this strategy. In the long run, producers could be trapped    in these relationships. The price is defined by the supermarket while the producers    must incur increasing costs to meet new requirements. The producers must invest    in human capital (such as training in business and technical skills), quality    control infrastructure, business information, cold storage facilities (GARCIA,    POOLE, 2004). On the other side, in the short run, producers must acquire technical    knowledge in order to meet it is an opportunity for them to acquire knowledge.    In the long run, producer could use this knowledge for expanding their activities    to new markets.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The European Union    is the main market for Brazilian mango and grapes and the main requirements    are the agrochemical analysis and certificates public and privates. One of the    most important certificates is the EurepGAP. The European Union accounts for    73% of Brazilian grape exports and 69% of Brazilian mango exports (SECEX - FOREIGN    TRADE SECRETARIAT, 2005). The EurepGAP was created in 1997 by a group of British    and Dutch retailers called <i>Eurep</i> (<i>Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group</i>).    The group is composed of agricultural producers, inputs and services industries.    According to Eurep (2005) EurepGAP "is a set of normative documents suitable    to be accredited to internationally recognised certification criteria such as    ISO GUIDE 65 and internationally recognised". The objective is "to reduce the    risks in the agricultural production". One of the duties of the Group is to    transfer knowledge about production techniques to farmers and there is a commitment    to continuous improvement in order to deal with emerging issues. It is also    important the fact that retail sector has been increasing the food imports from    different countries and it is fundamental to know the origin of fruits and vegetables,    the production conditions in order to guarantee food safety and sustainable    production systems.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main principles    of EurepGAP certification are: (a) Food safety: derived from HACCP principles;    (b) environmental protection: standards refer to diminishing the negative (c)    effects of Agricultural production on the environment; (d) Occupational heath,    welfare and society: standards refer to the activities on a farm and the conditions    of workers;(e) animal welfare (where applicable).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The certificate    is granted to single producers and group of producers organized in associations    or cooperatives (BUREAU VERITAS, 2005). The members of Fruits and Vegetables    EurepGAP are composed of retail and food service members, suppliers and associates.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>5. The Petrolina-Juazeiro    Region (PJ)</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The S&atilde;o    Francisco Valley region, more specifically the Petrolina-Juazeiro Region (PJ),    offers favorable conditions for irrigated agricultural activity, thus configuring    one of the largest fresh fruit exporting regions in Brazil. The irrigated area,    with a predominance of fruit in this region, covers 120 thousand hectares and,    among the main agricultural activities, the mango and grape farming can be pointed    out. In the grape and mango production, the Sao Francisco Valley can be detached,    where the greatest mango and grape producers in the country can be found. The    area farmed with table grape in the region rose by 71.8% in the 1991/1995 period,    which expanded the cultivated area from 2,620 hectares to approximately 4,500    hectares. The production increased from 1,050 tons to about 12,500 tons, which    led to an increase in exports, generating 18,000 direct jobs (VALEXPORT, 2005).    From 1997 to 2004, the participation of the Sao Francisco Valley region in the    mango and grape production underwent very few alterations in terms of exported    volume (in tons). In 1997, the Region accounted for 100% of the grape exports    from Brazil and in 2004 this proportion was 98%. Concerning mangoes, the participation    vary from 98% in 1997, to 92% in 2004 (VALEXPORT, 2005).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>5.1 The history    of S&atilde;o Francisco Valley</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 50s, there    were huge public and private investments in the Sao Francisco Valley where is    located P-J region. Studies of the natural resources in the region were initiated    at that time. All this work involve many activities such as the analysis of    the soil to see the perspectives for irrigation projects, investigating the    most suitable crops, the size of properties and the best way to manage the water    supply. Furthermore, there were investments in infrastructure of transport,    energy and urban and irrigation structure (GAMA SILVA, 2001).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 60s, the    Federal Government created two irrigation projects called Mandacaru and Bebedouro.    Both projects involve the expropriation of 500 hectares of land. In these projects    were settled about 200 producers, 100 in each one. A centre of agricultural    research was installed in each project in order to test a varied of crops. The    main idea is to find out the characteristics of development of each crop and    its adaptability to the regions conditions. The introduction of these projects    was fundamental to initiating a learning process for all agents involved. In    the next decade, there was an extension of the project and the creation of other    institution, the Codevasf - the Federal Government Agency. The Codevasf was    responsible for all execution of the irrigation project. From the studies of    technical and economic feasibility to the activities involving many agents from    different sectors including the participation of private firms. The Codevasf    implemented 6 irrigation projects. Each project was composed of pieces of land    from 6 to 200 hectares, about 38.000 hectares was distributed between medium    and small producers. The Company supplied producers with the irrigation structure,    land and water subsidies (DAMIANI, 1999; GOMES, 2004).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v48n3/02t01.jpg"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Gomes    (2004), small producers held, in 1980, 80% of the projects land. This percentage    was decreasing and it fell to 60% in 1996. The small producers were replaced    by medium producers who increase the size of their properties and to diversify    the production. According to Leite et al (2005) about 70% of mangoes and 60%    of grapes are produced by small producers in the husbandry structure.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first export    initiative was carried out in 1986 by melon producers. However, there were problems    related to the quality of the fruit in the external market. In the beginning    most exports were done by Cotia. Cotia was a cooperative composed of Japanese    immigrants which was created in the 20s. The cooperative made an agreement with    Codevasf and about 30 cooperative producers were settled in one of the irrigation    projects. The Cotia had an export office located in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,    which was responsible for negotiating and distributing melons and other fruits    from it members in Europe. After a great success there was an increasing of    the number of melon producers and the exports. Nevertheless the marketing channel    of the new melon exporters was not the Cotia one and thus starting the quality    problems. The problem was the image of the Brazilian melon was affected in the    external market which had negative impact on Brazilian melon exports. It points    out that fruits in the external market are recognizable by the country of origin.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This experience    showed the importance of collective action of producers in order to guarantee    a quality pattern. In these terms, the objective was to create an association    to solve the quality problems (DAMIANI, 1999; GOMES, 2004). According to Damiani    (1999) the function of the Cooperative was fundamental in the learning process    in PJ. Their members were responsible for spreading the Cotia production techniques    for external and internal market. The Cotia participated in the negotiation    and the coordination of grape small producers for exporting collectively through    an organisation called Brazilian Grapes Marketing Board - BGMB (which changes    from BGMB to BGMA - association instead of board).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1987, there    was the first mango and grape export. This time the producers had already the    melon experience and they were more prepared in technical and commercial terms.    One of the problems detected by producers in the beginning was the lack of agents    to centralize the exports actions in the Region, such as the presence of associations    and cooperatives (SILVA, 2001). In 1988, the association of producers was created,    the Valexport. The association received financial support in its early years    from Codevasf and professional support from Cotia (DAMIANI, 1999).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to    Codevasf, Cotia, Valexport there is another institution which has been performing    a great function in the region, the Embrapa - The Brazilian Agricultural Research    Corporation. This was created in 1976 and its action was fundamental in adapting    the right variety of mango and grape according to the climate and soil conditions    of the region.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main varieties    of grape and mango come from the South and the Southeast of Brazil. The Embrapa    had to develop new techniques of cultivation in order to adjust the plants to    the new conditions. Besides, it was fundamental to produce in periods when Brazil    could enter into the external market. The techniques of floral induction developed    by Embrapa were essential to producing at the right period according to the    market demands. Furthermore, the Embrapa has undertaken an important function    in the Integrated Fruit Production System (IFP) program. The IFP is explained    in detail in item 6.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two of the main    associations in the PJ are Valexport and BGMA. Valexport is responsible for    70% of the total PJ fruit production and 80% of total fresh fruit exports. Specifically    for mango, the Valexport members accounted for 60% of exports (Valexport, 2005).    The BGMA is composed of 130 producers. The association is responsible for 65%    of PJ grape exports. Its main responsibilities are to negotiate the transport    (by air or sea) to Europe or other markets and to buy all the inputs for grapes    production. The field research shows that the cost of transport by sea of a    kilo of grapes is US$ 0,19 (American dollar) and the same cost for a company    from PJ, who is negotiating individually, is US$ 1.20. In Brazil, there are    some studies about the PJ region development features and the export activities    (BARROS, COSTA &amp; SAMPAIO, 2004; LACERDA &amp; LACERDA, 2004; GAMA SILVA,    2001; OLIVEIRA FILHO, COSTA &amp; XAVIER, 2008; SAMPAIO, 2007; CACCIAMALI et    al, 2006). However, in this study the field research was conducted also with    European buyers and it was possible to identify the main requirements and investigate    the actions done in PJ in order to meet them.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>6. Integrated    fruit production<font size="2"> </font>and the mango and grape cases</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The integrated    fruit production system (IFP) arose in Europe in the 1970s, aiming at the integrated    pest control in the farms so that the use of pesticides could be diminished.    The IFP allows tracking production, providing the producer with a certification    seal and the exporter with quality fruit (VITTI &amp; CINTRA, 2003). The IFP    is a holistic program based in four points. The organization of production structure,    the sustainability of the system, the monitoring of process and information.    This production system aims at the production of high quality food resulting    from the use of techniques that take into consideration the environmental impacts    on the soil, the water and crop system, allowing to evaluate the quality of    the products, considering the physical, chemical and biological characteristics    of the local natural resources in the processes involved in the productive chain.    The main importance of program is to have a succession of steps defining to    producers how to meet the external requirements. The adoption of IFP allows    the traceability of the fruit, the integrated control of pests and diseases    as well as the certification indicating compliance with Integrated Production.    The application of IFP depends on change in mentality on the part of the producers    involved, which requires a multidisciplinary team to make the Program possible.    The IFP emerges as an answer to the consumer trends which present a greater    concern about food safety and the use of production techniques that promote    environmental sustainability. In 2006, there were 17 crops in Brazil being produced    according to the new system. Nevertheless, only apples count on certified integrated    production; mangoes and grapes produced in the Petrolina- PE and Juazeiro -    BA regions have their processes close to obtaining the certification (ANDRIGUETO    &amp; KOSOSKI, 2005). There are some steps in meeting all IFP requirements.    These steps were defined according to standards of innovation and efficiently.    The first step is to transfer to the producer knowledge about the IFP principles.    At this level producers must be totally conscious about the principles of IFP.    Secondly, producers must meet the principles of Good Agricultural Practices    (GAP). In the next step, producers must meet the HACCP (hazard analysis and    critical control point) and GAP principles. Follow the EurepGap principles and    finally the IFP certificate. Therefore, producers must meet the requirements    of GAP, HACCP and EurepGap in order to get the IFP certificate. Those producers    who join the integrated fruit production system receive an affiliation credential    to the cultivation system and compromise in abiding by the production regulation    established by the norms, as well as in submitting to specific inspections and    technical control. Furthermore, producers must adopt a single way for documenting    field reports related to crop and phytosanitary operations performed in their    properties, as was established for the product, called "field notebook". It    should be pointed out that producers must also attend government certified formation    courses on integrated production, or belong to associations or organisms counting    on qualified technical personnel. Complying with the specifications presented,    the producer can use the integrated production certificate (EMBRAPA, 2002).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The introduction    of IFP in the PJ can be divided in two periods. In the first period the project    trained mainly large mango and grape producers. The Embrapa unit in the city    of Petrolina - PE was very active in that period and worked towards raising    awareness of the local producers training specialized technical personnel in    the area who guide producers. The second period started in 2003 and it involves    an agreement between Embrapa; the Brazilian Micro and Small business Support    Service - Sebrae; Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply - MAPA    and Nilo Coelho Irrigation District. The main objective is to widen the program    to include small producers. Medium producers could participate if they are members    of associations or cooperatives. In this second period the project is composed    of three elements: training, technology and commercialization. In other words    the main idea of this project is to transfer to small and medium producers the    benefits of IFP standards such as the reduction of agrochemical costs, the organization    of production activities, the control of production systems through field notebook,    training about pest control and floral induction in order to be able to plan    harvest and to get certificates.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two agronomic engineers    and eight agricultural technicians were hired to undertake the training of producers.    These agricultural technicians visit the properties every week to teach production    techniques to small farmers and evaluate the field notebook according to IFP    standards. The agricultural technicians teach producers how to improve the system    and infrastructure on the farm to meet IFP requirements such as storage conditions    and use of agrochemicals. Besides the agronomic engineers organize and give    training about EurepGap certificate. The main idea is to show to producers the    requirements of the certificate and how to meet these requirements in the property.    The training is elaborated according to the reality and necessities of small    properties. In the meantime producers receive information about how to get the    certification and the financial support for this. As a whole the certification    process takes three years and the project pays 50% of the total cost involved.    In addition to this, producers have the opportunity to use a palm top computer    instead of a field notebook. In this case, producers can get financial support    from the project. About 50% of total costs to replace the traditional field    notebook with palm top are paid by the project and the other half is paid by    producers.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>7. The description    of relationships between PJ producers and European Buyers</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relationships    between mango and grape producers from PJ and European buyers can be classified    in: vertical integration, consignment - selected firm, consignment - trust relationship    and consignment basis. In the <b>vertical integration</b> the producers commercialize    their fruits themselves. Producers have commercialization offices located in    Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. They are responsible for all activities from    production to deliver them to wholesalers and retailers in European countries.    According to producers, the main argument in favour of hierarchical relationship    is to the closeness to the consumption market. Fruits are highly perishable    and it is important to understand how the market works in order to obtain competitive    advantage. Some of these producers are negotiating directly with German retailers    and they have wide understanding of the preferences of different markets. They    are undertaking the functional and inter-sector upgrading. In the <b>consignment    basis</b> producers hire one firm (or more) to commercialize theirs fruits in    Europe. The firm receives a commission which could vary from 7% to 10% of total    sales. They have no long term relationships which mean that European firm transfers    to producers just the information about the standards of fruits. There is no    commitment between them, which means an arms' length relationship. This kind    of relationship is predominantly between mango exporters, mainly the ones which    do not have certificates. In the relationship called <b>consignment - selected    firm</b> producers are represented by a firm in the external market and a contract    is established and signed by both parties. When the first shipment of the season    arrives in Europe the firm verifies the quality standards of fruits. If the    fruits meet the standards, the firm pays producers for the production in that    season. This part of payment is less than 50% of the total payment for the season.    This firm is responsible for commercializing the fruits and to transfer to producers    all knowledge about market preferences and tendencies as well as the knowledge    about new standards and how to meet them. Despite the fact that the relationship    is closer than a consignment basis, the firm receives a commission for its services    from 7% to 10%. At last, there is the <b>consignment - trust relationship</b>    which involves long term links (about 10 years in some cases) and high frequency.    The higher frequency in the accomplishment of a relationship also helps the    involved agents to have better knowledge of each other. In this situation, the    firm transfers to producer knowledge about production techniques, preferences    of market, and tendencies and it also receives a commission which could vary    from 7% to 10%.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>8. Discussion    of results</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the first    export experience with melon, the producers on the region were awake of the    importance for exporting in group. The experience in PJ shows that members of    a cooperative or association can reduce the transport costs to Europe and to    buy inputs in group which reduce the prices paid. They also can obtain technical    capability trough their relations with buyers and more information about the    preferences of the market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In terms of institutions,    Embrapa is responsible for transferring knowledge about production techniques    to producers. Valexport is responsible for organizing the producers in order    to be represented in the Government. Cotia was responsible for spreading the    knowledge about production techniques. Their members were prepared for meeting    the standards from global market and they were aware of the importance of collective    action. More recently, the IFP program expanded for small producers due the    agreement between Sebrae, Embrapa, and Mapa. Besides the Senador Nilo Coelho    Irrigation District has been supporting the producer initiatives to meet the    requirements of the global market. Also, the PJ history and its learning process    are fundamental for the development of the region. Finally, the different kind    of relationships between PJ producers and European buyers indicate the sort    of knowledge transferred to producers in these transactions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the    GVC approach the producers of PJ have been undertaking different types of upgrading.    Firstly, the product and process upgrading resulted from technical capability    acquired in their relations with external agents, such as buyers and institutions.    Secondly, some of PJ producers have got commercialization offices in Rotterdam    which are responsible for negotiating their sales. In this case they are acquiring    knowledge about consumer markets and marketing channels and are undertaking    functional and inter-sector upgrading. This kind of upgrading is so important    because producers can learn with this process and to acquire knowledge about    market preferences and the dynamic of channels marketing in Europe.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>9. Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of    this paper is to identify some elements which contribute to the entry of small    and medium producers into the global market. The categories of analysis considered    on this study are: the routines for acquiring capabilities, path dependency    which is related to the learning process of the organization and the history    of organization, and the environment which refers to the links to institutions    and other agents.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The grape and mango    producers in PJ have been meeting the supermarket requirements and there are    some institutions which are so important for supporting their activities. The    experience of PJ shows the importance of institutions such as Cotia and BGMA    for the learning process of producers and their entry into the global market    and how is important the interactions in the group for obtaining knowledge about    production techniques and consequently for reaching export markets. The BGMA,    which is most composed of small and medium producers, is responsible for 65%    of PJ grape exports. In the case of PJ, the producers acquire capabilities for    meeting the requirements of the external market through interactions with institutions,    other producers and buyers. The main institutions are Embrapa, Codevasf, Sebrae.    They are undertaking product and process upgrading obtained due technical capability    and functional and inter-sector upgrading acquired from market capabilities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding managerial    implications the experience of PJ shows the importance for producers to develop    closing and long term relationships with buyers in order to obtain more technical    and market capabilities. For buyers it is also important this kind of relationship    because they can guarantee an increase of range, quality and seasonal availability    of fresh fruits. Besides, the experience of BGMA shows the importance of reducing    transport costs for exports to Europe as an important competitive advantage    for their members. The experience of PJ shows the importance of different kind    of institutions involved in the process of development and how is essential    the action of the government providing infrastructure for associations and cooperatives    initiatives in order to guarantee their competitiveness in the external market.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>10.

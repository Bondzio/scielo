ABSTRACT This article introduces and discusses how the concept of transparency is considered in the area of water resources, as well as the concept's contribution to public practices from a neoliberal perspective. To substantiate this discussion, we examine how transparency has become a quality indicator for water governance. Finally, the article urges readers to reflect not only on how the availability of information may become one more practice of control of government, but also on how the lack of data or low quality data may redirect actions and lead to inequality in country-wide access to, and distribution of water.

This article analyzes the familialist perspective of Argentina's last military dictatorship (1976-1983) on the militants of political-military organizations. These women were called "bad mothers/ mothers denatured". Sinking its roots in the traditions of eugenics, the hygienism and Catholicism, the categories of "abandonment", "danger" and "inheritance of subversion", were implemented to justify the "salvation" of their children and so the society, appropriating children criminally. Thus, the study of this paradigmatic case aims to contribute to the field of discussion about the rich and complex relationship amongst kinship, gender and politics.

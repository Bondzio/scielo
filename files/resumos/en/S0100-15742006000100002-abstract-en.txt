This exploratory research project aims to analyse the perceptions of adolescents enrolled in public and private schools of the Federal District on violences in their schools and commnities. As the literature presents evidence that violences are common to both types of institutions, in spite of diverse characteristics, this study focused particularly upon similarities and differences between their students. The study gathered data using focus groups. Results confirm the occurrence of violences, however, both types of schools use different strategies to deal with them. Public schools often expect police support, whereas private ones maintain preventive control of persons and their movements. Conclusions emphasize the greater explanatory power of conflict theories in Sociology of Education, as well as the need of the schools to be aware of changes inside and around them, considering the adolescent societies and their own dynamism and active roles.

This article aims at analyzing the main forms of housing precariousness in São Paulo, that means houses in irregular buildings lots, shanty towns, slums besides precarious verticalized houses located mainly in the central area of the metropolis. Taking as reference the year of publication of the work São Paulo 1975, Growth and Poverty, the authors discuss the hypothesis that the recent growth of the City of São Paulo and the transformation of the housing panorama is reflecting not only the perpetuation of the old social differences but also increasing inequalities and segregation.

Abstract This work is an effort to link institutions and environmental governance, focusing on the Brazilian offshore oil and gas sector. A case study detailing the experience of an environmental unit of Brazil`s federal environmental agency (Coordenação Geral de Petróleo e Gás, Diretoria de Licenciamento, Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis - CGPEG/DILIC/IBAMA) is used for this purpose. This unit is in charge of handling environmental permits for projects in this area. The methodology follows the institutional analysis and development framework as described by Ostrom (2011). Results reveal an environmental governance system characterized by the lack of policies that complement the issuing of environmental permits. In addition, we describe the institutional environment at CGPEG, demonstrating the existence of trust among its personnel. Finally, our conclusions indicate the importance of ensuring the permanence of the public staff, as well as the need to structure strategic governance systems.

The paper intends to give critical information about the indigenous education in Brazil, with its focus to the subject of intercultural curriculum and the Indians Teachers Training Courses. For that, it describes the history of some projects under the responsibility of non governmental organisations that were working, by the end of the XX century, for the construction of the Indians Curriculum, with visible repercussion in the actual official public politics. It approaches, specially, theoretical and methodological challenges that spring about for the non-indian educators in these processes, concerning the curriculum planing and development, along with the unavoidable implications over the social identities representations of the indians teachers and their students, and the use of Indians and Portuguese Languages.

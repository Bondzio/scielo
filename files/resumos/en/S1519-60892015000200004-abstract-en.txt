Abstract This paper, part of a PhD research, aims to understand the meanings given by women from different social classes to the so called &#8220;humanized birth&#8221;. The investigation included interviews and fieldwork in two places, both of them in the city of Rio de Janeiro: in a public birth center and in a private pre-natal course, offered by a ReHuNa activist. The results suggest that middle class women give special importance to the reduction in pharmacological intervention and to the body experience, considered to provide a subjective growth. The poor women value specially the way in which they are treated by the nurses/midwives that work in the birth center and the fact that there they are treated as people, not only as a body that gives birth, as usually happens in public maternities in Brazil.

Three                processes are proposed to be considered for a methodology of studying newagers impact                on cultural hybridization: 1) Theirs condition as designer of self religions made                with scraps of different religious traditions, as Champion and Hervieu-L&#232;ger (1990) points; 2) Their agency as &#8220;nodal agent&#8221;                to knit joints, alliances and network connections between other nodal agents among                various circuits and other social fields; and 3) their competence &#8220;pollinator&#8221;                (metaphor bringed by Soares 2009) of cultures                and religions.

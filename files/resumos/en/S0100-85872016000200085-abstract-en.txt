Abstract At my fieldwork in a Catholic Social Centre, I had noticed that youngsters well succeeded in the social inclusion process were encouraged to offer a testimony to other excluded teenagers. This practice was rooted in Paulo Freire&#8217;s pedagogy and aimed to exhibit them as protagonists and &#8216;empowered&#8217; youngsters. This text explores a series of entanglements of testimony as a practice, discussing it as simultaneously Christian and secular, informative and performative, individual and relational. The conclusion suggests that the testimony&#8217;s efficacy is dependent on these entanglements, which are visible in its historicity (from Freire&#8217;s pedagogy to the actual use) and in its relational temporality (the narrator past is projected on the future of his audience), making visible the Brazilian Catholic secularity.

In 1999, the ILO put forward the concept of decent work (DW) to define an agenda for the discussion and promotion of public policies regarding work, especially concerning socially vulnerable groups, more specifically young people. Brazil has become a central country in this discussion because of the set of initiatives adopted together with the ILO towards creating DW. This article proposes a type of assessment of DW at an individual level, using data from the National Research by Home Samples, and built a comparative chart of the last 20 years (1993, 1998, 2003 to 2012). With this chart it was possible to conclude that young people have been getting more decent work and, in this process, have become more dependent on the degree of regional development and urban mobility, thus stretching the discussion concerning young people&#8217;s access to more decent work to the issue of urbanism.

During the 2000 Millennium Summit, leaders of countries from the entire world committed to devote every effort in order to achieve eight development goals by 2015. Concerned with that possibility, the United Nation's General Secretary, trying to mobilize the political will that is needed for the implementation of the commitments made with the Millennium goals,createdthe Millennium Project to offer a technical backdrop in regards to the most efficient means of reaching each goal. This Project is made of taskforces and one of them is in charge of goal 2 (to ensure universal access to primary education by 2015) and goal 3 (to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women). This article intends to highlight a few aspects regarding the intersection of these two themes, because, on one hand, questions pertaining to gender have generally been receiving little attention in education debates; on the other hand, education has been equally neglected in the gender equality agenda.

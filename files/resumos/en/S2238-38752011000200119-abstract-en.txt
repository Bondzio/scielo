Abstract: This article tries to analyze the profile of solidarity economy enterprises: how are they organized, which are their indicators of participatory management, their conditions to ensure sustainability and social inclusion of workers excluded from the labor market. It consists of an analysis of 2007 data base from the SIES (Information System of Solidarity Economy) created by the Ministry of Labor and Employment. We attempted to verify what is meant by organizing solidarity work in a market characterized by its opposite, and also in what extent collective management is effective. We prioritized the enterprises characterized by cooperative or collective work of the following economic sectors: recycling, sewing, shoes, and food. We also considered the recovered factories and professionals associations or cooperatives from the sectors of engineering, computing and education. We concluded that, in general, the solidarity enterprises can be more effectively considered as a result of compensatory policies than as an alternative to formal employment or wage labor.

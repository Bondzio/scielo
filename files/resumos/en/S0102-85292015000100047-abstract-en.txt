The article suggests a thorough analysis of the evolution of the BRICS idea and concept in the context of international power game and sources of its current role and place on the world arena. It further considers Russia's approaches to the BRICS club. While it was the first to suggest idea of high level meetings between the four BRIC countries, its initial attitude was rather reserved with very limited role seen for the grouping. Nevertheless over time being Russia came to seeing BRICS (with addition of South Africa in 2011) as the primary forum for political and economic coordination and essential mechanism for its foreign policy realization. Another aspect considered within the article is the argument often presented by outside observers trying to suggest that BRICS is a 'deadborn child' or that divergences are prevailing with no commonalities found. Thus positions of each of the BRICS countries in the global economic, financial, trade and political aspects are analysed with the initial approaches to the claimed 'compatibility of BRICS economies'. Also the author reviews some of the examples of the successful coordination of the five countries within the other international institutions and results achieved, but also looks at the cases where BRICS demonstrated differing approaches to the problem. Nevertheless offered analysis suggests that the BRICS, while not having identical positions and interests, found each other to be able to promote a better, fairer, more inclusive world order.

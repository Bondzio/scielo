This article addresses the influence of Mathematics performance in basic education on the choice of career in higher education. In Phase 1, this two-phase analysis calculates a relative educational efficiency in mathematics for each Unit of the Federation (i.e. State), using data from the Sistema Nacional de Avaliação da Educação Básica [National Basic Education System], and the Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio [National Secondary Education Exam]. Phase two correlates this efficiency with demand for courses at university entrance. If there is a strong positive association, it can be stated that the State with greatest educational efficiency in mathematics has a greater demand for this course. Results show that the most efficient States in relation to Mathematics are also those where students choose careers more closely related to mathematics, especially various types of engineering courses. Another more troubling result suggests that careers involving teacher-training in exact sciences, such as Physics and Mathematics, are in greater demand in States with less efficiency in Mathematics.

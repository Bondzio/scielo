Abstract: The program Ellas Hacen (women who do) is presented as an innovative proposal that articulates different governmental instances, reclaims the demand for counter-benefits through cooperatives created by the government and appeals to training to strengthen human capital. From a regional perspective, the role of women in social policies will be analyzed in the scenario of post-2009 Argentina, characterized by the expansion of interventions that transfer income to families through mechanisms that distanced themselves from the typical programs of Transferencias Condicionadas de Ingresos (conditional cash transfers). This work will study tensions within the design of the policy extended over time, with redefinitions linked to the margins granted to bureaucracies. Furthermore, the difference between developing policies "for women" and mainstreamed by a gender perspective; and what is offered and demanded from women both in the approach to problems of violence and care will be discussed.

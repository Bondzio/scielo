This paper proposes a reflection on the uses of irony in the theoretical and literary texts written by women. In investigating some classical feminist texts dedicated to the archeology of the discourse of the gender and the domains such as identity, knowledge, nationality and authorship, the paper describes the emergence of violence resulting from the ironical degradation of the values which legitimate the literary meaning. In insisting on the participation of the reader in the process of the ironical dissimulation, the paper analyzes the importance of emotions in the functioning of the irony. In addition, the present reflection shows that the feminine discourse is a particularly intense space of challenge and risk, exposed to the struggle of power, and also potentially impregnated by the anger.

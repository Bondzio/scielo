The purpose of this study, which is based on schools' effects literature, is to identify public schools and municipalities that improve the learning of their students. The effects of schools and municipalities were compared with other educational quality indicators such as the Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica (Basic Education Development Index) and the per-student municipal expenditures, as well as the efficiency of the municipal public school systems. Data from the 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011 editions of the Prova Brasil exam were used to estimate hierarchical regression models that allow better control of contextual factors that influence the results of the students. This study shows that the effects of schools and municipalities are better indicators of educational quality than the Basic Education Development Index and identify several schools and municipalities where, given the social-demographic characteristics of the students and of the school context, have effects that are well above the expected, and are cost effective.

This paper makes a general discussion on the trajectory of social studies of science                and technology, presenting the seminal debate in the sociology of science and the                current questions put in this field, especially those brought by the so-called                constructivism. We argue for the need to extend the debate about the cognitive                content in the closure of scientific controversies, a content often overlooked in                some constructivist approaches. This, however, does not mean to deny the importance                of such approaches for exposing the social content involved in science and                technology. We conclude by suggesting some topics worth to deepen regarding the                implications of such reflections for the context of Brazilian society and other Latin                American countries.

Abstract Mariza CÃ´rrea broadened the perspectives of anthropological analysis and of feminism itself, as the selection of articles with which I present some of the dimensions of her feminisms intends to reveal. The depth of her vision and scope of her themes of interest, her incredible insight and capacity to deepen issues, have made her work required reading. Extremely sensitive to the complex structures of the systems of domination and their strategies, Mariza was always alert towards any forms of biologicalization of social differences in the name of racism, machismo and homophobia. Her understanding that feminism should be a militant action and not the crystallization of women in the role of helpless victims; her enormous capacity for reading and her creativity made her a special interlocutor.

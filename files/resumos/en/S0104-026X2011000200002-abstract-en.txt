We propose an interpretation of D. Cronenberg's movie Dead Ringers which seeks a referential ground in Ancient Greek symbolism. Even though the movie explores subjects that are emblematic of late modernity - the problem of shattered identities, the problematic relations between self and body or the increasing ambiguity of gender representations - we argue that the same issues can be found in some fields of Greek culture. We claim the similarities are not coincidental but reveal, instead, the existence of universals in symbolic representation. We add ethnographic examples to support this claim.

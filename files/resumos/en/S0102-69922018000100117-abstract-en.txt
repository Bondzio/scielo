Abstract Based on the contributions of decoloniality theorists and in dialogue with the tradition of Black Atlantic studies, the article, in search of a cognitive justice, proposes a horizontal and equitable dialogue between these two political-academic thinking fields and Brazilian black intellectuals. For the development of this argument, we radicalized the commitment of the decolonial project with the body-geopolitics of knowledge&#8217;s assumption, as well as proposing a greater emphasis on roots, rather than on routes, in studies of the Black Atlantic. This affirmation of the body-geopolitics of knowledge and roots is the key to the ontological and epistemological affirmation of black populations as well as to construct a multi-versal and transmodern dialogue, in which particular experiences are not lost in a provincialism or in an abstract universalism.

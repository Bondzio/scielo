In the past few decades, outsourcing has become a fundamental phenomenon for the comprehension of the changes in labour world and in its institutions. The book Trabalhadores terceirizados e luta sindical brings out the main elements which affect the possibilities and limits of trade union action in a fragmented environment produced by outsourcing. Further, the book brings two innovative points to the literature on this subject: the confirmation that although weakening trade unions struggles, outsourcing process doesn't prevent the organization of outsourced workers. It also argues that outsourcing makes deeper the problems of corporative trade union structure inherited from Estado Novo, imposing limits on workers struggle.

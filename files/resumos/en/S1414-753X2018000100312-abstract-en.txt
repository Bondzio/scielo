Abstract Uçá-crab consumption is a cultural trait in Brazil, but overexploitation threats the species. The defeso is a moratorium aimed to protect the uçá - prohibiting capture/sell - but such strategy requires public support. The perception about the defeso among consumers/vendors in Recife - PE was analyzed indicating contradictions between declared concern and practices. Although 50% of vendors identified a decrease in supply and 88% declared concern, 50% did not know the crab´s minimum size for sell, 75% did not respect the defeso, and 50% had never heard about it. 76% of consumers declared concern, but 90% were not interested on crab´s origin and 53% did not know about defeso. People who claim to know the defeso defined it correctly, but 84% missed correct dates; 61% consumed crabs even during the defeso. Although &gt; 95% of the public would like to know more about the defeso, such information is not reaching that public, weakening the strategy.

Between 2004 and 2007, it was celebrated at the city of Valencia, Spain, the 32nd edition of the America's Cup, the oldest sport event, the most prestigious in sailing world and one of those of major economic and media impact that exists nowadays at international level. Although it was the first time in which such event was celebrated in Europe, the outcomes were unanimously considered to be a success of organization, attendance and audiences. This article addresses one of the less explored aspects of sport mega-events, which is the residents' perception about their influence and consequences in the host society. For that it has been carried out a qualitative research -consisting in twenty interviews-, that has contributed to identify the arguments and discourses regarding this edition of the America's Cup.

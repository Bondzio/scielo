In this article we trace the changes undergone by the cult and festival of San Sebastian in Las Ovejas, Neuquén, near the Chilean border, over recent years. There have been a series of transformations intimately related to institutional changes in the Catholic Church, to Argentine political and economic life and to local and regional processes. The democratic reopening since 1983 and the almost simultaneous economic integration project for the Southern Cone, called Mercosur, meant the opening of two relatively closed national economies and their gradual integration into a single market, aiming at higher competitiveness and access to international markets. The latter requires international borders to become more permeable. The heterogeneity of actors (priests, politicians, devotees, etc.) and interests (economic, tourist, religious, etc.) involved in the festival indicate its multi-vocal nature. The origin of the celebration is linked to the severing of Trans-Andean relations towards mid 20th Century. San Sebastians devotion comes as a mediator between local and Argentine national belonging, its Chilean past and institutionalization under the Catholic Church. An analysis of the organization and meaning of the celebration allows us to reflect upon certain classical and apparently antagonistic anthropological categories, such as tradition and innovation, conflict and harmony.

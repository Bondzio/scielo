ABSTRACT In this paper, we map how the behavior of a Supreme Court judge can influence the political process. We offer an expanded framework of judicial powers to shape the behavior of political actors, and demonstrate how the Brazilian Supreme Court allocates these powers in an individualistic and decentralized way. In this scenario, which we label &#8220;ministrocracy&#8221;, constitutional politics becomes erratic, creating problems for the justification of the court's power in a democratic regime.

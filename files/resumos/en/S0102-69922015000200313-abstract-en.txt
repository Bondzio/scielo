AbstractThe paper introduces the contemporary debates on the relation of social sciences in Africa and Brazil by framing them both under the current discussion about the "sociologies of the south" and the ones on "the geopolitics of knowledge". Deploying the notion of a "non-exemplary sociology", I seek to present some possible theoretical and methodological ways that would enable a more symmetric positioning of the knowledge produced outside the Euro-America.

Based on encompassing evaluations of educational research, the article sustains that all the deficiencies mentioned are both consequent and determinant of the poor theory/method approach presented by that research. The importance of theorization is emphasized as a mean of fostering transferibility of the knowledge produced, which, by its turn, facilitates its diffusion among practitioners and its evaluation by the scientific community. Finally, it is sustained that the identification of patterns, dimensions and relations, or even the construction of explicative models, is not only compatible with the study of micro-social phenomena, but also constitutes an essential step in the construction of theory and in its application to other contexts.

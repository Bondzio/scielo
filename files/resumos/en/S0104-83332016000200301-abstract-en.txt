Abtract This text aims to rethink the relationship between Brazilian feminisms and the state. Dialogue and continuous tensions are grounded in the feminist agenda that not only presupposes a cultural revolution regarding subjectivities, but that also exacts a notable reform or political revolution. On the one hand, while addressing violence against women is gaining ground, on the other, education for gender equality and the legalization of abortion suffers what has been called &#8220;backlash&#8221;. There is a clash between neoconservatives movements that seek to imposed their moral viewpoint on the whole society and feminist movements that defend the ethics of individual autonomy, plurality and social rights.

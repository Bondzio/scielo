Ethnic cultural identity is a source of meaning and for constructing reality, even when it appears to be marginal. Cultural processes are in conflict and each ethnicity has a history of struggle to determine its goals and values. Ethnicity is understood as a process constructed in social practice from a relational perspective. The realization that society is criss-crossed by oppositions and tensions of class, ethnicity and gender whose interests often collide, points out the need to develop studies that show how the school has acted and continues to act faced with the challenge of cultural diversity. Enguita (1995) states that the school is not just one more place where prejudice and ethnic tensions repeat. It is the key place because it is essential to cultural production and reproduction. Thus, paying attention to the varied polyphonic cultural traditions and rediscovering them is a step to understanding the meanings produced in the articulation of educational processes. This study showed that the school experiences much difficulty in dealing with cultural differences, usually prioritizing one ethnic perspective to the detriment of the others. Results indicate that multi-culturality is a fertile goal for the educational process.

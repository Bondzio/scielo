In Uruguay, the last decades have not witnessed physical violence episodes in rural areas resulting from class or political violence. Small farmers and rural workers are under everyday violence: for the former, it is decrease in profitability at their small enterprises, being expelled from their land, emigration; for the latter, it is low wages, work accidents, and the absence of freedom of organization. However, the mechanisms of social integration available to the Uruguayan society absorb the dissent and prevent them from ending up in violence.

Abstract In this paper, we take the concepts of religion and public space as relational domains. Based on this point of view, we follow van de Port&#8217;s proposition about the circularity of Orisha&#8217;s Candomblé in Bahia&#8217;s public space, seeking to articulate the author&#8217;s ideas to the recognition that the circularity produces a cartography of heterogeneous mediators, namely, that Candomblé provides varied agencyings, including, among them, the symbolic goods of wide circulation in the public space. Based on these arguments, we try to understand the relationships between Eguns&#8217; Candomblé and Orisha&#8217;s Candomblé in the Island of Itaparica, by bringing out to discussion ethnographic elements that suggest problematizing van de Port&#8217;s argument, indicating that the circulation of Candomblé in this locality does not processes such as in Salvador, but presents important asymmetries in the ways of social legitimization and visibility of that religion in Itaparica.

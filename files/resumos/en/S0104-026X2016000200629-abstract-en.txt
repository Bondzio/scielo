Abstract: The objective of this paper is to discuss the limitations and advances in gender relations that took place in Brazil and in the World in the last 70 years, since the creation of the United Nations Organization (UN) and, specially, since the Fourth World Conference on Women carried out in 1995, based on the report entitled Progress of The World's Women 2015-2016 Transforming Economies, Realizing Rights, elaborated by the UN Women in 2015. The data generally reveal substantive achievements of women in the last seven decades. But also show an incomplete revolution, maintaining the sexual division between productive and reproductive work, which limits the autonomy and empowerment of women in family and society.

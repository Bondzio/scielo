The purpose of the research was to determine, through the calculation of net present value and internal return rate, the viability of fruit production in the North area of Rio de Janeiro State, as well as to identify, using the Monte Carlo Method, the risk of each activity. The results show that fruit production can be a good alternative to the region. All the analyzed activities presented satisfactory profitability, and the highest internal return rates found for passion fruit, soursop, pineapple and sugar apple. The variable with greatest effect on profitability was the product sale price, and equally important were labor cost, price of fertilizers and cost of irrigation equipment. Pineapple, cocoanut, sugar apple, passion fruit and soursop practically offered no economic risks, while the greatest risks were presented by mango and guava.

Abstract What are the advantages of methodological triangulation? Although there is a general consent about the importance of mixing quantitative and qualitative methods, studies that effectively use multi method approach are still rare. This article provides an introduction to mixed methods. Our target audience is both undergraduate and graduate students in early stages of training. Methodologically, we will summarize the main recommendations in the literature and use two examples to show how mixed methods can be applied to empirical research designs. With this paper we hope to diffuse the utilization of mixed methods in Brazilian Social Sciences.

The    followers of the Swiss-German reformer Paracelsus (1493-1541) had seen in chemistry    - and alchemy - a new foundation for learning (<a name="2not"></a><a href="#not2">2</a>). Paracelsus had burned the    <i>Canon </i>of Avicenna publically in 1527 at Basel and his followers rejected    the Aristotelian-Galenic tradition of the universities. They saw little value    in disputations or the study of logic and they sought an alternative to the    four elements in Natural Philosophy and their attendant humors in medicine.    They scorned the reading of the books of the ancient philosophers and saw truth    primarily in the two books of Divine Revelation, the Bible and the Book of Creation    or Nature.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Paracelsians    sought truth in Nature through fresh observations and they were convinced that    chemistry - through the intelligent use of the fire - would be the best guide    to this knowledge. They interpreted the account of God's Creation in <i>Genesis    </i>as an alchemical separation and they presented their three chemical principles,    salt, sulphur and mercury, as a new approach to the elements. Their questioning    of ancient element theory was to call into question the whole framework of ancient    natural philosophy and medicine.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sixteenth-century Paracelsians for    the most part accepted uncritically the concept of the macrocosm-microcosm universe    which stated that man was a true microcosm of the great world about him.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus the study of nature and the Cosmos    would lead to secrets about man. In practice this affected medicine and pharmacy    since they believed that the study of nature would yield a rich bounty of medicines    for mankind. Paracelsus had been a physician himself and his Chemical Philosophy    was to be subscribed to primarily by physicians. In short, this was a philosophy    of both nature and medicine. Its proponents were deeply immersed in religious    thought which was often mystical and alchemical in outlook. All of this clashed    with traditional education and one of the results of the ensuing debates surely    was the acceptance of chemistry as a respected subject in the course of the    next century and a half.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At first there was a question as to    what chemistry really was. Even all those who were convinced of the importance    of this subject did not subscribe to the broad claims of the most dedicated    Paracelsians. Daniel Sennert (1572-1637) of Wittenberg warned that.</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chymistry is      not a peculiar Art, but belongs to Physick, and is the perfection of it, for      it is the part only of the Physitian to use and apply Chymical medicines for      cure, and &#91;he&#93; may be called then a Chymical Physitian, and the Medicines      Chymical, which are the perfection of Physick ... &#91;But some wish to&#93; enlarge      Chymistry, arid dispute principles and labour to bring in new operations into      all the parts of Philosophy and Physick, but it is not for Chymists, as such,      to dispute of principles, but for Physitians and Philosophers (<a name="3not"></a><a href="#not3">3</a>).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sennert's call    for the recognition of the benefits of chemistry offended both these Galenists    who were opposed to chemical medicines and those devoted Paracelsians who hoped    to reform the entire system of higher education to conform to their concept    of chemistry as a key to all knowledge.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The English Paracelsian, R. Bostocke,    complained in 1585 that</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">... in the scholes      nothing may be receiued nor allowed that sauoreth not of <i>Aristotle, Gallen,      Auicen, </i>and other Ethnickes, whereby the yong beginners are either not      acquainted with this doctrine, or els it is brought into hatred with them.      And abrode likewise the Galenists be so armed and defended by the protection,      priuiledges and authoritie of Princes, that nothing can be allowed that they      disalowe and nothing may bee receiued that agreeth not with their pleasures      and doctrine... (<a name="4not"></a><a href="#not4">4</a>).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robert Fludd (1574-1637)    had studied at Oxford and abroad and he deplored the fact that learning was    still grounded on Aristotle in philosophy and Galen in medicine. (1617). They    had been heathens and their doctrines had been demonstrated to be antithetical    to Christianity. For Fludd also it was essential that the universities be reformed    so that the divine light of Christian teachings could flourish. It need hardly    be added that Fludd believed that his own far reaching and mystical Chemical    Philosophy should be the proper basis of academic learning (<a name="5not"></a><a href="#not5">5</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jean Baptiste van Helmont (1579-1644)    is the author in whom we find the most detailed expression of seventeenth-century    Paracelsism (<a name="6not"></a><a href="#not6">6</a>). In his short autobiography he wrote of his education at the    University of Louvain. The story of his disillusionment with the traditional    educational process and of his refusal to accept the degree, Master of Arts,    need not be retold here. Nevertheless, he returned to the Louvain to immerse    himself in philosophy and medicine. And although he still    had not reached the certainty he so desired, he was not so foolish as to decline    the doctorate in medicine he earned in 1599. It was only after some years of    travel that van Helmont began to read the works of Paracelsus ... and it was    then that he became convinced of the importance of chemistry as a key to nature,    and especially man. Because of this conversion he became convinced of the necessity    of educational reform.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Van Helmont proposed a seven-year educational    program, the first three years of which would be devoted to traditional subjects    such as mathematics, geography and natural history. But then, he wrote,</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">... let them      come to the Study of Nature, let them learn to know and seperate the first      Beginnings of Bodies. I say, by working, to have known their fixedness, volatility      or swiftness, with their seperation, life, death, interchangeable course,      defects, alteration, weakness, corruption, transplanting, solution, coagulation      or co-thickning, resolving. Let the History of extractions, dividings, conjoynings,      ripenesses, promotions, hinderances, consequences, lastly, of losse and profit,      be added. Let them also be taught, the Beginnings of Seeds, changing, motion,      and disturbance of things to be altered.</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And all those      things, not indeed by a naked description of discourse, but by handicraft      demonstrations of the fire. For truly nature measureth her works by distilling,      moystening, drying, calcining, resolving, plainly by the same meanes, whereby      glasses do accomplish those same operations. And so the Artificer, by changing      the operations of nature, obtains the properties and knowledge of the same.      For however natural a wit and sharpness of judgment the Philosopher may have,      yet he is never admitted to the Root, or radical knowledge of natural things,      without the fire.

He turned to Francis Bacon for his emphasis on new observations and the    inductive method, for his mystical interpretation of the universe which he considered    to be both Christian and chemical, and to van Helmont for his views on educational    reform through the Chemical Philosophy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I believe that it is clear that the    English debate over the place of chemistry in higher education follows directly    from the discontent of the Paracelsians. And yet we know that higher learning    was not reformed on the basis of their Chemical Philosophy. Indeed, the traditional    university curriculum may have found its strongest champions among the new mechanical    philosophers who found the mystical world views of the Paracelsians and their    fellow travellers, the alchemists, far more repugnant than Aristotelian philosophy    or Galenic medicine. John Webster had been answered by the Oxford dons, Seth    Ward (1617-1689) and John Wilkins (1614-1672), who accused Webster of plagiarizing    Bacon and van Helmont. They ridiculed his belief in magic and mystical chemistry    and countered that true chemistry was indeed being taught at Oxford along with    all of the most recent advances in the sciences. Ward and Wilkins were members    of the educational establishment and while they promoted the work of Harvey    and Copernicus as well as the corpuscularian philosophy, they believed that    this could best be done by adding this material to the existing curriculum rather    than turning to the works of the Chemical Philosophers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">University lectures in chemistry were    not being given at Oxford in 1654 although it was in the summer of that year    that Robert Boyle (1627-1691) moved there where he established a chemical laboratory with several assistants (<a name="11not"></a><a href="#not11">11</a>). He was    later to bring to Oxford the chemist, Peter Sthael of Strasbourg, who began    to give classes in the subject privately in 1659 (<a name="12not"></a><a href="#not12">12</a>). Olaus Borrichius (1626-1690)    found much interest in chemistry at Oxford during his visit in June and July,    1663 (<a name="13not"></a><a href="#not13">13</a>). However, by this time there were a number of chemical laboratories    in England. R.T. Gunther lists those owned by Prince Rupert, George Wilson (1631-1711),    Cornelis Drebbel (1572-1633) and his son, Jonathan Goddard (1617-1675), and    the laboratory at St. James Palace presided over by Nicolas Lefèvre (1664-1665)    (<a name="14not"></a><a href="#not14">14</a>). There were additional laboratories administered by the Royal College of    Physicians and numerous pharmacists who specialized in chemical oils and waters.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was, however, no official instruction    in chemistry at Oxford or Cambridge until the 1680s. Seeking a permanent home    for his extensive collections, Elias Ashmole (1617-1692), antiquarian, alchemist    and member of the Royal Society, planned the Museum at Oxford which would include    a chemical laboratory, a display area, and a lecturer (<a name="15not"></a><a href="#not15">15</a>). Dr. Robert Plot    (1640-1696) was appointed the first Professor of Chemistry on the recommendation    of John Evelyn who had been impressed by his book, <i>The Natural History of    Oxfordshire </i>(1677) (<a name="16not"></a><a href="#not16">16</a>). The building was opened in 1683 and Plot's chemical    lectures began the same year. Chemical experiments were carried out in the laboratory    by mid-summer with the assistance of Plot's operator, Christopher White (<a name="17not"></a><a href="#not17">17</a>).    A text of Plot's lectures which existed earlier is now lost, but other manuscripts    at the British Library indicate that he accepted the traditional belief in the    great Elixir, the Grand Arcanum and the Alkahest (<a name="18not"></a><a href="#not18">18</a>). Thus, although Plot's    students may have used Nicolas Lemery's <i>Cours de chymie </i>(1st edition,    1675) as a text, they were being taught by a chemist whose personal beliefs    were still closely connected with traditional alchemical and Helmontian concepts.    Plot resigned his post in 1689 and it was not until the early years of the new century    that chemical instruction at Oxford took on a Newtonian tinge with the work    of John Friend and John Keill.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regular chemical lectures were offered    first at Cambridge in 1683 also. The lecturer, John Francis Vigani (c. 1650-1713)    had spent years travelling on the Continent and his text, the <i>Medulla Chymiae    </i>had been published in Danzig the year before (<a name="19not"></a><a href="#not19">19</a>). In contrast with the    situation at Oxford, the laboratory facilities available to Vigani were very    limited. He taught at his humble quarters at Queen's College without the benefit    of a chemical operator and one of his early students, Abraham De la Pryme, complained    that he had " little or no good" from the course " by reason    of the abstruseness of the art" (<a name="20not"></a><a href="#not20">20</a>). Nevertheless, Vigani was named "Honorary    Professor of Chemistry" in 1703 and an elaborate chemical laboratory was    set up for him at Trinity College in 1710, three years before his death.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is more information available    on Vigani's teaching than that of Plot. The young Stephen Hales took his course    as did John Yardley whose notes do survive (<a name="21not"></a><a href="#not21">21</a>). But it is Vigani's <i>Medulla    Chymiae </i>that gives us the best idea of the content of his course. The <i>Medulla    </i>is a short text of some seventy pages and of relatively little distinction    when compared with the works of Lemery or Lefèvre. In the preface the author    emphasized the importance of atomism in regard to chemistry and he assured the    reader that this would serve as a satisfactory means of explanation of all of    the ancient and modern systems of elementary theory (<a name="22not"></a><a href="#not22">22</a>). Vigani then proceeded    to a general introduction discussing the etymology of the word chemistry, the    antiquity of the art, and its object. A short section on the principles was    then followed by the expected descriptions and preparations of chemical substances    arranged according to the mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. The book closed    with a short description of chemical equipment and three plates. Vigani's work    is perhaps most, interesting for the fact that it does not emphasize the linkage    with medicine as exclusively as do many others of the period.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is an unbroken line of chemical    instruction at Cambridge and Oxford dating from the lectures of Vigani and Plot    in 1683. But what of the rest of Europe? Twenty years    ago Hubicki came to the conclusion that in fact chemistry had been taught in    many European universities in the sixteenth century (<a name="23not"></a><a href="#not23">23</a>). He pointed to Martin    Stampeis' <i>Liber de Modo Studendi seu Legendi in Medicina </i>published in    Venice in 1517 which recommended that medical students be familiar with the    chemical tracts in the <i>Opera </i>of Arnald of Villanova. He also pointed    to the very large number of sixteenth-century alchemists and Paracelsians who    had studied at the University of Basel. He concluded that "such a great    number of active alchemists... is very significant and may point to the fact    that in the University of Basel lectures on chemical practice must have been    given", (<a name="24not"></a><a href="#not24">24</a>). This conclusion may be somewhat forced, but in fact there    were as unusually large number of students at Basel in the late sixteenth century    who were to show a special interest in alchemy, chemistry or chemical medicine.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose of    Hubicki's research was to show that chemistry was being taught at universities    prior to the appointment of Johann Hartmann (1568-1613) to the chair of Chymiatria    at the University of Marburg in 1609 (<a name="25not"></a><a href="#not25">25</a>).    This has repeatedly been referred to in the literature as the first university    appointment in chemistry, a claim in which there is only partial truth because    of the likelihood of earlier chemical instruction through medical courses elsewhere    and because of the frequent confusion among historians of science between chemistry    as we understand it and the chemical medicine of the Early Modern Period.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we look at    the work of Hartmann we see a Renaissance polymath with broad interests. He    had been educated at Marburg and had been appointed Professor of Mathematics    in 1592. However, his interests changed and he took his M.D. "degree there    in 1606 and was appointed Professor of Chymiatria three years later. His first    publication in his new field of interest was the <i>Disputationes Chymico-Medicae    </i>of 1611 which included his inaugural address and seven disputations by his    students. In his address he took issue with all those who might argue that medicine    could be complete without chemistry. This, he said, "pernego &amp; pernegabo,    dum vixero" (<a name="26not"></a><a href="#not26">26</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He accepted the    great antiquity of the art as a valid proof of its truth, he approved of the    Paracelsian tria prima, salt, sulphur and mercury, and the use of the macrocosm-microcosm    analogy (<a name="27not"></a><a href="#not27">27</a>). These mystical views were also to be elaborated in his <i>Introductio    in Vitalem Philosophiam. </i>But although Hartmann was critical of Aristotle    and Galen, he did not condemn all of the ancients. Like many Paracelsians he    approved of Hippocrates and for this reason he preferred to speak of a "Nov-Antiqua    Medicina", which drew selectively from the ancient medical sources as well    as the new chemical medicine (<a name="28not"></a><a href="#not28">28</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hartmann's views    were supported by those of his students. Thus Henricus Crollius wrote that "Medicine    and Chemistry can not be separated."Indeed, "Chymia est solidae philosophiae    fons, clavis sapientiae, anima &amp; medulla physices, medicinae radix, &amp;    meta, in quam viri sapientes collimant."(<a name="29not"></a><a href="#not29">29</a>) Johannes Rhenanus discussed    chemical equipment (<a name="30not"></a><a href="#not30">30</a>) and operations while Henricus Petraeus sought to conciliate    the major points of difference between the Chemical Physicians and the Galenists    (<a name="31not"></a><a href="#not31">31</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hartmann's interest in the practical    aspects of chemistry may best be seen in his <i>Praxis Chymiatrica </i>(1633)    which appeared two years after his death and then frequently throughout the    remainder of the century ... often along with Oswald Croll's <i>Basilica Chymica    </i>(1609). Here was to be found a large number of chemical preparations for    medical usage along with Hartmann's commentary on three other iatrochemical    tracts (<a name="32not"></a><a href="#not32">32</a>). But if his <i>Praxis </i>served as a standard book of chemical    preparations, Hartmann's interest in teaching may be seen also in his notes    to Jean Beguin's <i>Tyrocinium Chymicum </i>(1610) which first appeared under    the pseudonym of Chrisoph Glückradt in 1618 (<a name="33not"></a><a href="#not33">33</a>). The <i>Tyrocinium </i>was    the earliest in the celebrated series of French chemical textbooks which culminated    in the <i>Cours de Ckymie </i>of Nicolas Lemery in 1675.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is little doubt that many seventeenth-century    students of chemistry learned the subject with the aid of the many editions    of the Hartmann version of Beguin's work, but his teaching bore fruit as well    through his many gifted students. Johann Rhenanus found employment at the court    of the Landgrave Moritz of Cassei and his <i>Solis </i>e <i>Puteo Emergente    </i>went through at least four editions during the century (<a name="34not"></a><a href="#not34">34</a>). The renowned    alchemist, Johann Daniel Mylius, was Hartmann's brother-in-law as well as his    student (<a name="35not"></a><a href="#not35">35</a>). He, too, was to prepare a widely read book of chemical compositions.    Hartmann 's son-in-law, Henricus Petraeus, was later to become Professor of    Medicine at Marburg while another pupil, Daniel Beckher, became Professor of    Medicine at the University of Königsberg.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rapid growth    of interest chemistry in Germany in the course of the seventeenth century may    be ascertained by even a cursory look at the second volume of Partington's <i>History    of Chemistry </i>or the final volume of Thorndike's <i>History of Magic and    Experimental Science. </i>However the University of Jena is of special interest    because of the relatively early introduction of chemistry there and because    of the widespread influence of Werner Rolfinck (1599-1673). As in the case of    Hartmann at Marburg we see here the close connection of chemistry and medicine.    Recent research has shown that chemical lectures at Jena were inaugurated by    Zacharias Brendel (1553-1617) who had studied philosophy at Jena where he had    taken his master's degree in 1576 before going on to Padua for an M.D. (1581)    (<a name="36not"></a><a href="#not36">36</a>). On his return to Germany he was    appointed Professor of Philosophy at Jena in 1583 and then - nearly thirty years    later (1612) - Professor of Medicine. There is little doubt that he was convinced    of the importance of chemistry for medical students for he gave lectures on    this subject the following year and again in 1615.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The elder Brendel's    son, Zacharias Brendel, Jr. (1592-1638), also studied at Padua, but he then    returned home to take his medical degree at Jena in 1617 (<a name="37not"></a><a href="#not37">37</a>). Ten years later    he was appointed Professor of Medicine and the following year he gave a series    of lectures on chemistry    for medical students. These were to be the basis of his textbook, <i>Chimia    in Artis formam redacta </i>which appeared first in 1630 and then in another    four editions between 1641 and 1671. Here we read that , "chimia estars    nobilissima, veríssima, certíssima,", but at the same time it was understood    that chemistry was but a servant to its master, medicine (<a name="38not"></a><a href="#not38">38</a>). Brendel's book    is practical and based on four determined levels of heat fixed by the water    bath, the ash bath, flame and the blast furnace. Descriptions are given of the    various preparations that are possible with these heat sources.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Werner Rolfinck (1599-1673) was to be    the younger Brendel's successor and the first Professor of Chemistry at Jena    (<a name="39not"></a><a href="#not39">39</a>). He had been taught by Daniel Sennert at Wittenberg from whom he had surely    been initiated into the ongoing debate between the Galenists and the Paracelsians.    He had also studied for two years at Leiden before taking his M.D. at Padua    in 1625. Four years later he was at Jena as Professor of Anatomy, Surgery and    Botany - and in 1641 he was appointed the first Professor of Chemistry at that    University.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In all Rolfinck was to be at Jena for    forty-four years and he taught actively throughout that period. Rolfinck is    important as an early German proponent of the Harveyan circulation, but our    interest is primarily in his chemical work. The final editions of Brendel's    textbook were revised by Rolfinck and he also wrote his own textbook giving    it the same tittle, <i>Chimia Artis formam redacta. </i>The work appeared in    seven editions between 1661 and 1686.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rolfinck believed    that the student should be aware of the history of chemistry and the current    debates over its relationship to medicine (<a name="40not"></a><a href="#not40">40</a>).    He was convinced that a knowledge of the subject could be traced back to Adam,    but that medical chemistry was invented by Paracelsus and then spread by his    followers over the past century. He argued that chemistry - important though    it was - should be considered an art rather than a science and that it was properly    a part of medicine (<a name="41not"></a><a href="#not41">41</a>). As did other    text book authors of the period, Rolfinck    devoted most of his work to specific preparations, but it is from the other    subjects he discussed that we will gain greater insight into his approach to    the subject. He accepted the tria prima, Salt, Sulphur and Mercury (<a name="42not"></a><a href="#not42">42</a>),    but he questioned the Paracelsian doctrine of the macrocosm and the microcosm    (<a name="43not"></a><a href="#not43">43</a>). He further criticized the current    widespread belief in the powder of sympathy (<a name="44not"></a><a href="#not44">44</a>),    palingenesis or the resuscitation of plants from their ashes (<a name="45not"></a><a href="#not45">45</a>),    the concept of a universal medicine (<a name="46not"></a><a href="#not46">46</a>),    the transmutation of base metals to gold (<a name="47not"></a><a href="#not47">47</a>),    and the chemical production of the homunculus (<a name="48not"></a><a href="#not48">48</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also of interest is Rolfinck's discussion    of the teaching of the subject. He noted that Angela Sala had written that a    six month course in chemistry was sufficient for the physician to become proficient    in the subject while Anthony Gunther Billich had recommended a six week course    in which the student first learned about chemical equipment and the structure    of furnaces and then went on to study the distillation of plants and parts of    animals before turning to salts, stones and metals (<a name="49not"></a><a href="#not49">49</a>). Rolfinck preferred    to give his students a broader introduction to the subject. He began with a    defence of the nobility of chemistry, vindicating it from the attacks of the    Galenists. He then went on to a discussion of the chemical principles before    proceeding to the classes of substances arranged according to tradition: vegetable,    animal and mineral.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This early development    of chemistry as a part of medical education in Germany may be ascribed to the    strong Paracelsian influence in Central European Medicine and it may be contrasted    with the situation in France. There the medical faculty in Paris remained opposed    to chemically prepared medicines until late in the seventeenth century (<a name="top49a"></a><a href="#back49a">49a</a>).    Nevertheless, chemistry flourished both through independent instruction at the    Jardin des Plantes and elsewhere - as well as at the University of Montpellier.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Greater Surgery </i>of Paracelsus    had been translated into French by Pierre Hassard of Armentières as early as    1566 while Jacques Gohory had prepared a <i>Compendium </i>of Paracelsian theory    the following year (<a name="50not"></a><a href="#not50">50</a>). At this time there was already an indication of the    forthcoming debate when the Medical Faculty and the Parlement of Paris forbade    the internal use of antimony. The following decade witnessed a lively debate    between Joseph Duchesne (c. 1544-1609) and Jacques Aubert on the origin of metals    and their internal use. The work of Paracelsus and the role of chemistry in    medicine proved to be a key element of this exchange. Concurrently Roch le Baillif    (d. 1605) published his summary of Paracelsian medicine (1578) and then moved    to Paris from Brittany where he actively promoted this new medical heresy. The    reaction from the Medical Faculty was swift and predictable. Le Baillif was    ordered to halt his practice as well as his lecturing. On his refusal to do    so he was summoned before the Parlement where he openly defended Paracelsian    medicine. The Medical Faculty won this case and le Baillif was ordered to return    to Brittany.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After this time publications on chemical    medicine increased rapidly in France reaching a peak in the flood of works debating    the new medicine that resulted from Duchesne's theoretical <i>De priscorum philosophorum    verae medicinae materia </i>(1603). Once again the members of the Medical Faculty    banded together to refute the chemists, this time led by the Jean Riolans, father    and son.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Early in the new century Jean Beguin    arrived in the capitol where he set up a laboratory and gave lectures on pharmaceutical    preparations (<a name="51not"></a><a href="#not51">51</a>). Permission for this was granted not from the members of the    Medical Faculty, but from Court physicians among whom were several iatrochemists    (<a name="52not"></a><a href="#not52">52</a>). Beguin's lectures were to result in his <i>Tyrocinium chymicum </i>(1610)    which saw more than forty editions through the end of the century. In the course    of its publishing history it was greatly expended and we have already noted    the edition prepared by Johann Hartmann.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The details of    the chemical debate in France have yet to be studied in depth. Certainly there    is little doubt that this continued to be a subject of contention for over a    century. Guerlac has investigated the work of Guy de La Brosse (1586-1641) and    the foundations of the <i>Jardín Medicinal des Plantes. </i>First proposed in    1616, this project was seen by the Parisian Medical Faculty not only as a threat    to their monopoly of medical teaching, " but an overt criticism of their    whole approach to medical study and practice, their neglect of botany and their    hostility to the chemists", (<a name="54not"></a><a href="#not54">54</a>).    Indeed, de La Brosse's chief work, <i>De la nature, vertu et vutilité des plantes    </i>(1628) includes a general treatise on chemistry while a portrait of Paracelsus    graces the title page. And although the <i>Jardín desplantes </i>was not formally    opened until 1640, it was to become a center for chemical teaching. The first    Professor of Chemistry was William Davidson (1648), already a well known chemical    author. He was to be succeeded by Nicolas Lefevre, Christophe Glaser and Moyse    Charas in the course of the century (<a name="55not"></a><a href="#not55">55</a>).    All were to write important chemical works. It seems clear that a medical student    seeking chemical instruction in seventeenth-century Paris would have had to    go beyond the circle of medical professors from Sorbonne. If a student sought    more than the chemistry taught at the <i>Jardín des plantes </i>he could turn    to the medical curriculum taught at the University of Montpellier. There he    would find a more independent approach to the medical classics. In the fourteenth    century Arnald of Villanova had been associated with the medical school and    his chemical tracts remained widely read two centuries later. Nor did the Medical    Faculty at Montpellier resist Paracelsian chemical medicine in the unyielding    fashion of their Parisian colleagues. They may have looked on Paracelsian mysticism    with caution, but they certainly accepted many of the new chemically prepared    remedies. One of the most distinguished seventeenth-century proponents of chemical    medicine was Theodore Turquet de Mayerne (1573-1655) who had taken his medical    degree at Montpellier in 1597 (<a name="56not"></a><a href="#not56">56</a>).    Both through his active defence of Joseph Duchesne's work against the Medical    Faculty of Paris in 1603 and through his influence in incorporating chemical    remedies in the <i>Pharmacopoeia Londinensis </i>(1518) Mayerne played a significant    role in the acceptance of the new chemical medicine in the seventeenth century.    The Montpellier physician, Théophraste Renaudot (1586-1653), promoted the new    medicine as well, and he was supported by Cardinal Richelieu who saw here an    opportunity to lessen the medical monopoly of the Parisian doctors (<a name="57not"></a><a href="#not57">57</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the Galenists of Paris the University    of Montpeilier seemed a hotbed of chemical radicalism. In 1644 both physicians    and professors of Montpeilier were forbidden to hold assemblies or to practice    medicine in Paris. Jean Riolan (1577-1657) wrote that there was a need to purge    Paris of the " <i>Hermétiques et Emétiques </i>de l'Eschole de Montpeilier",    physicians who claim to know a thousand secrets of medicine, but who in reality    do not even know the old method of curing taught by Hippocrates and Galen (<a name="58not"></a><a href="#not58">58</a>).    No one should be deceived, he added, Théophraste Renaudot was a disciple of    Paracelsus. And what of the other chemists? Mayerne had wished to give medical    lessons to apothecaries and barber surgeons and to make public anatomies (<a name="60not"></a><a href="#not60">60</a>)    ... Johann Guinter von Andernach who had written on both the old and new medicines    stood condemned as a Lutheran (<a name="61not"></a><a href="#not61">61</a>) ... and Pierre Palmier who had wished to    introduce chemistry to medicine had been condemned    (<a name="62not"></a><a href="#not62">62</a>). The use of metals as purgatives in medicine - and especially the pernicious    use of antimony internally was to be firmly rejected (<a name="63not"></a><a href="#not63">63</a>). How could the law    rigorously punish the crime of homicide while ignoring those physicians who    proceed to kill their patients with these new poisonous medicines (<a name="64not"></a><a href="#not64">64</a>)?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But although the    physicians of Montpeilier were associated with chemical medicine from an early    period they made no appointment in chemistry until relatively late. Antoine    d'Aquin, Doctor of the Medical Faculty at Montpeilier and First Physician to    Louis XIV, became convinced that the study of this science should be established    at Montpeilier (<a name="65not"></a><a href="#not65">65</a>). The position was    given to Sebastian Matte, called La Faveur, who had already been giving lectures    on the subject at Montpellier for some years and whose <i>Pratique de Chymie    </i>had been published two years earlier. His Lettres-patentes of 1675 permitted    him to give a public lecture course every year in the Faculty of Medicine (<a name="66not"></a><a href="#not66">66</a>).    However, he was given a salary commensurate with that of a Professor with similar    rights, prerogatives, exemptions and immunities. These privileges came as a    shock to the members of the Medical Faculty who had no wish to see a chemical    operator whom they considered to be illiterate raised to their own status (<a name="67not"></a><a href="#not67">67</a>).    Arguing that this was a medical subject they recommended that a new Chair in    Chemistry be established and given to a medical doctor who would then be set    over and above the chemical demonstrator. This suggestion was approved and Arnaldus    Fonsorbe (d. 1695), a Doctor Aggrégé of the Faculty since 1665, was appointed    the first Professor of Chemistry at Montpellier (<a name="68not"></a><a href="#not68">68</a>).    There is no evidence that he published anything of significance in the field,    but on the other hand there is no evidence that there was any undue friction    between him and Matte.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Matte's <i>Pratique de Chymie </i>gives    a good indication of his teaching of the subject. He defined chemistry in its    relation to medicine. It is "l'Art de séparer les parties du corps naturel,    de les purifier, &amp; de les rejoindre, pour les usages de la Médecine."    (<a name="69not"></a><a href="#not69">69</a>). His elementary substances are phlegm, spirit, sulphur, salt and "    terre morte", the most commonly accepted group from this period (<a name="70not"></a><a href="#not70">70</a>). After    a description of chemical operations and equipement he devoted the remainder    of the book to chemical preparations which he divided into the customary categories    of mineral, vegetable and animal. There is little new here and perhaps the most    novel aspect of the book is the author's preface in which he asked why another    chemical text is needed at all. He cited the excellent texts of Beguin, Hartmann,    Crollius, Duchesne, Schroeder, Davidson, Lefèvre and Glaser which some might    argue "leave nothing further to be said on this matter", (<a name="71not"></a><a href="#not71">71</a>). His    only defence was that he would add some preparations not to be found in the    other authors and that occasionally he would present the subject matter in a    different fashion.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Montpellier continued    to be in the forefront of the teaching of chemistry in the    eighteenth century. After death of Fonsorbe in 1695 Antoine Deidier (d. 1746)    was appointed Professor of Chemistry in 1697, a position he was to hold for    nearly half a century. Although not a widely known figure among either historians    of chemistry or historians of medicine, he deserves attention since he published    widely in both chemistry and medicine (<a name="72not"></a><a href="#not72">72</a>). This may be illustrated by two of    his books, the . <i>Chimie Raisonnée </i>(1715) and the <i>Institutiones Medicinae    Theoricae </i>(1711).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deidier's chemical    text based on his Latin lectures presented at Montpellier, but printed in French    to be more useful " aux jeunes Médecins, aux Chirurgiens, &amp; aux Pharmaciens    dans les Provinces éloignées ..." (<a name="73not"></a><a href="#not73">73</a>) In his introductory letter to the    volume Dr. Pestalossi of Lyon noted the lingering public suspicion of chemistry    due to the prevalence of charlatans and impostors who promised cures for all    illnesses with a single universal remedy. However, he added, true medicinal    chemistry is an art of which the utility is known to all people of learning    and good sense. (<a name="74not"></a><a href="#not74">74</a>). Deidier wrote in the tradition of seventeenth-century    medical chemistry. His text differed from those of his predecessors primarily    in that he spent no time on the history and definition of the subject, nor did    his book present the reader with the familiar descriptions of chemical equipment    and operations, topics that were standard in most other accounts. Deidier turned    first to the chemical principles: water, earth, salt, sulphur and spirit -essentially    the same five adhered to by most chemists over the past half century (<a name="75not"></a><a href="#not75">75</a>). Deidier    made the point that these elements -which he defined as the simple bodies of    which all things are composed - are not the same as the elements of Descartes    (<a name="76not"></a><a href="#not76">76</a>). The latter form the basis of Cartesian cosmology, but they are of little    value to the chemist who seeks his elements through laboratory separations and    distillations. This preliminary material completed, Deidier then turned to the    heart of the book, the chemical preparation of substances of medicinal value    and most of these were of inorganic materials.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a member of the Medical Faculty Deidier    did not hesitate to publish on purely medical subjects. Here his <i>Institutiones    Medicinae Theoricae </i>is divided into discussions of physiology, pathology    and therapeutics. In the section on physiology he noted that this subject had    been altered due to the modern discoveries in physics, chemistry and anatomy.    This new information has " led to the more perfect knowledge of the nature    and structure of the human body", (<a name="77not"></a><a href="#not77">77</a>). Deidier divided the subject into    three parts, the principles, the fluids, and the solids (<a name="78not"></a><a href="#not78">78</a>). Arid again he    presented the Cartesian position on the three sizes of elementary particles    and their cosmological significance (<a name="79not"></a><a href="#not79">79</a>). But he turned to chemical tradition    when he stated that all substances are mineral, vegetable or animal in origin.    These, he assures us, are composed of the five chemical principles (<a name="80not"></a><a href="#not80">80</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deidier's long tenure at Montpellier    helped to assure a continued influence of chemical medicine at that institution.    And if it is evident that he was well aware of Cartesian philosophy, it is also    clear that his work reflects the French chemical text book authors. The history    of chemistry at Montpellier deserves detailed research because of the development    of vitalistic medicine there in the eighteenth century. The roots of this school    may well be based in the continued influence of seventeenth-century iatrochemistry    at a time when that medical philosophy was being supplanted by a more mechanistic    approach to medicine elsewhere.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Netherlands the leading university    of chemical instruction was eventually to be Leiden in the eighteenth century    due to the enormous influence of Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738) whose courses    were attended by students from many countries and whose textbook of chemistry    was translated into numerous languages. We will not be concerned with his work,    but the background to the appointment in chemistry at Leiden is important to    us. Here, once again, we find chemical instruction rooted in the iatrochemistry    of the seventeenth century. In his paper on early chemistry at Leiden Van Spronson    has discussed the first appointments in chemistry. The noted iatrochemist, Franciscus    de Ia Boë Sylvius (1614-1672) was appointed Professor of Clinical Medicine in    1658 and when Anton Deusing was being considered for an appointment to the Medical    Faculty in 1666 Sylvius threatened to resign unless given a chemical laboratory    and a Professorship in Chemistry (<a name="81not"></a><a href="#not81">81</a>). But    although this was promised to him by the Board, nothing came of it immediately.    Only three years later did the Board confirm its earlier decision in noting    that "nothing was lacking to make the distinction of the Medical Faculty    complete but the preparation of medicaments in a chemical manner and the performance    of experiments in the field of chemistry", (<a name="82not"></a><a href="#not82">82</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first appointment by the University    was Carel de Maets (1640-1690) who had been trained by Glauber in Amsterdam    and then had gone on to the University of Utrecht as an unsalaried Decent (<a name="83not"></a><a href="#not83">83</a>).    But there he had had no laboratory and he was attracted to the new position    at Leiden where the chemical laboratory was opened in 1669. He was appointed    without salary, but by 1672 he was Ordinary Professor in the Faculty of Philosophy    and seven years later was given the same appointment in the Medical Faculty.    De Maets had some competition from Jacob Le Mort (1650-1718) and Christian Margraaf    (1626-1687) (<a name="84not"></a><a href="#not84">84</a>). The former had also worked in Glauber's laboratory and then    he had set up his own laboratory in Leiden. He had also gone to Utrecht for    an M.D. (1678). Margraaf's doctorate had been taken at the University of Franeker    in 1659. He then moved to Leiden where he gave chemical lessons to students    much to the annoyance of Sylvius, De Maets, and Le Mort. At the death of De    Maets in 1690, Le Mort was given the management of the chemistry laboratory    at Leiden, but other recognition was slow to come. Approval of his promotion    to Professor of Chemistry was obtained in 1697, but the appointment was not    made official until 1702. At his death Boerhaave added the Chair of Chemistry    to those in medicine and botany that he already held.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Professorship in Chemistry at Leiden    had been established because of the recognized need of this subject for medicine    and the seventeenth-century publications connected with the early instructors    bear this out. De Maets wrote two books, the <i>Prodromus chymiae rationalis    </i>(1684) and the <i>Chymia rationales et praxis chymiatricae </i>rationalis(1689),    whose titles indicate a familiar medical orientation Le Mort's <i>Chimia, Rationibus    et Experiments ... </i>of 1688 was also aimed at medical students. The five    chemical principles are mercury or spirit, sulphur or oil, salt, phlegm    and earth (<a name="85not"></a><a href="#not85">85</a>) and the reader is presented with the expected description of    chemical processes and equipment before going on to the chemical recipes. The    medical tenor of the volume is modified only in the opening pages where Le Mort    discussed the goal of chemistry. Here the medical or pharmaceutical goal is    only the second of four. The first is contemplative chemistry which deals with    the chemical anatomy of bodies through the use of fire. The third is metallurgy    and the last is transmutation or alchemy (<a name="86not"></a><a href="#not86">86</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most comprehensive document from    the seventeenth-century Leiden chemists is the <i>Collectanea ckymica, Leydensia,    Maëtsiana, Margraviana,, Le Mortiana </i>which was put together from notes taken    by an English medical student, Christopher Love Morley (b. ca. 1646, M.D. 1679)    and first published in 1684. This is a book of some six hundred pages in the    1693 edition and it includes long sections by the three Leiden teachers from    whom Morley took courses (<a name="87not"></a><a href="#not87">87</a>). The first Prolegomena is attributed to Margraaf,    the second to Le Mort, and the bulk of the volume is the customary collection    of recipes - in this case arranged alphabetically. Marginal notes indicate Morley's    sources. More popular than any of the books published by his instructors, Morley's    volume was not appreciated by them. De Maets attacked Morley in his <i>Prodromus    </i>while the others complained that they were not responsible for Morley's    statements.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We still know far too little of the    origins of the teaching of chemistry in European universities. Surely the few    institutions I have touched on here represent only a fraction of those we might    have referred to, We have already mentioned Utrecht where De Maets had taught    prior to moving to Leiden. This was to become the home of Johann Conrad Barchusen    {1666-1723) who taught chemistry there from 1694 and who was to become Extra-ordinary    Professor of Chemistry in 1703 (<a name="88not"></a><a href="#not88">88</a>). Johann Kunckel (1630 or 1638-1703) was    appointed Professor of Practical Chemistry at Wittenberg in 1677 (<a name="89not"></a><a href="#not89">89</a>) while    at Helmstedt Johann Andreas Stisser (dates unknown) taught chemistry and published three volumes of <i>Acta </i>based    upon the work at his laboratory (1690-3-4) (<a name="90not"></a><a href="#not90">90</a>). At Erfurt Caspar Cramer (1648-1682)    was another Professor of Medicine who taught chemistry. His lectures, the <i>Collegium    Chymicum </i>were published posthumously in 1688 (<a name="91not"></a><a href="#not91">91</a>). Cramer taught Friedrich    Hoffman (<a name="92not"></a><a href="#not92">92</a>) (1660-1742) who had also spent some time at Jena where he had studied    chemistry under Georg Wolfgang Wedel, himself a student of Rolfinck. Hoffman    was to be given the first Chair in Medicine at Halle. His colleague at Halle,    Georg Ernst Stahl (1660-1734), was to develop the theory of phlogiston and he    too had studied under Wedel and had taught chemistry at Jena as early as 1684    (<a name="93not"></a><a href="#not93">93</a>). The situation was similar at Leipzig where the high influential Professor    of Medicine, Michael Ettmuller (1644-1683) also taught chemistry. His chemical    lectures were published as the <i>Chymia rationalis ac experimentalis curiosa    </i>(1684) and went through a number of editions in several languages (<a name="94not"></a><a href="#not94">94</a>).    Recognition of the importance of chemistry for medicine was granted at Leipzig    in 1700 with the approval of a fifth Chair in the Medical Faculty. However,    the appointment of a Professor of Chemistry was not made until ten years later    in Professor Scheider (<a name="95not"></a><a href="#not95">95</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There seems little doubt that chemistry    was widely discussed in an academic setting in the Renaissance. However, it    is difficult to pinpoint the actual introduction of actual chemical courses    because of the broad spectrum of definitions of chemistry. For some it was a    total system of man and nature proposed as a replacement for Aristotelian natural    philosophy and Galenic medicine. For others it was considered as little more    than a handmaiden to medicine through the preparation of chemically prepared    remedies. It was only in the course of the seventeenth century that    chemistry came to be widely accepted academically. But as this occurred the    far ranging cosmological claims of the Paracelsians were gradually rejected.    The academic recognition of chemistry came about because of its practical value    for the physician.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is customary to view seventeenth-century    chemistry as a subject divorced from the educational establishment. Surely the    Paracelsians had complained bitterly that students had no opportunity to study    chemistry. And Hélène Metzger's detailed study of the French textbook tradition    has centered on the Jardin des plantes where chemistry flourished rather than    the hostile Parisian Medical Faculty. The English scene has been examined primarily    from the standpoint of Robert Boyle and the Royal Society rather than the developments    at Oxford and Cambridge.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, as we    have seen, by the 1680s chemistry was being taught widely throughout the universities    of Europe. But university appointments had been made throughout the century.    The appointment of Johann Hartmann as Professor of Chymiatria at Marburg in    1609 points to the close connection of chemistry and medicine in this period    - and therefore to the importance of the Paracelsian tradition. The chemical    lectures of Zacharias Brendel the elder at Jena followed those of Hartmann by    only a few years and here again they introduced specifically for the benefit    of medical students. From Brendel we can follow a succession to his son, to    Rolfinck and Wedel - and then to Georg Ernst StahPs chemical course of 1684.    By this time courses were available at a number of other German universities    including Wittenberg, Helmstedt, Erfurt, Altdorf and Leipzig.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nor were chemical courses in France    confined to the succession of talented instructors at the Jardin des plantes.    In contrast with the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, the equally distinguished    Medical Faculty of Montpellier looked with favor on the chemically prepared    remedies of the Paracelsians. Certainly the Montpellier students, Theodore Turquet    de Mayerne and Théophraste Renaudot, stood in the forefront of defenders of    chemical medicine in the seventeenth century. In the case of Montpellier it    may seem surprising only that actual appointments in chemistry were not made    until 1675.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The universities in the Low Countries    reflect the situation in rest of Europe at this time. De Maets taught at Utrecht    prior to taking the newly established position in chemistry at Leiden in 1669.    Both he and his successor, Le Mort, had been trained in the laboratory of</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Glauber in Amsterdam.    The textbook of De Maets appeared in 1684, the same year as Morley's <i>Collectanea,    chymica Leydensia. </i>That the University of Louvain should have made an appointment    of a Professor of Chemistry through the Faculty of Medicine in 1685 should then    be looked upon less as a major innovation than as an expression of the recognized    importance of the field at this time. In the late seventeenth-century chemistry    was widely accepted in the universities of Europe. It was, however, a subject    that was accepted as a part of medicine rather than the basis of a new philosophy    of nature as the sixteenth-century Paracelsians would have wished. Only in the    course of the eighteenth century was the subject to establish itself as one    independent of medicine.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Allen Debus    é </i>professor do Centro Morris Sishbein de História da Ciência e Medicina    da Universidade de Chicago, nos Estados Unidos</font>.    <br>   <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Fludd... deplored    the f act that learning was still grounded on Aristotle in philosophy and Galen    in medicine.

Van Houtte, <i>The University    of Louvain 1425-1975</i> (Louvain: Leuven University Press, 1976), p. 105, the    Faculty of Medicine reacted to chemical medicine slowly...    <br>   in 1685, when the Council of State sought the Faculty's opinion as to whether    a Chair of Chemistry should be established, many reasons were quoted in opposition    to the plan: chemistry was already being taught, in part by the existing professors;    the timetable was full enough as it was, premises and furnaces for chemical    studies would be too costly; as a fifth examiner, the new professor would have    to have a place in the <i>Collegium strictum, </i>which would mean an increase    in examination-fees and would thus harm the less well-off students, who might    then be tempted to transfer to a less expensive University. Moreover, the Faculty    said, if the government did decide to go ahead with a fifth Chair, it must give    a stipend including examination-fees. One de Renault was then appointed on 12    September 1685. He should automatically have become a member of the Inner College,    but the Faculty refused him a place, and the governor had to send a special    delegate to Louvain to complete the business. The college was forced to admit    the new professor; examination-fees were put ap. The chemistry courses met,    in fact, with unexpected success, and no place in the Hall turned out to be    large enough to accomodate the crowd of students interested.    <br>   (<a name="not2"></a><a href="#2not">2</a>) The following short account of the    Chemical Philosophy is based largely on my own research which is brought together    in <i>The Chemical Philosophy : Paracelsian Science and Medicine in the Sixteenth    and Seventeenth Centuries </i>(<i>2 </i>vols., New York: Science History Publications,    1977), passim, and especially, 1, pp. 63-126.    <br>   (<a name="not3"></a><a href="#3not">3</a>) Daniel Sennert, De <i>chymicorum    cum Aristoulicis et Galenicis consensu ac dissensu...</i>    <br>   (Wittenberg: Apod Zachariam Schurerum, 1619; the cited edition is the third    printed at Paris: Apud Soaetem, 1633), pp. 5,7.

Brazilian Constitution ensures the right to family planning founded on the principles of the dignity of the human person and that of responsible parenthood. Such right is ensured not only to different sex couples but, individually, to men and women alike, for Brazilian Constitution also acknowledges individuals as a family community, that is, a "monoparental family". In order to ensure to every capable person a better fulfillment of that right, disregarding his or her sexual orientation, Brazilian Federal Medicine Council has established ethical norms to assisted reproductive techniques. Regarding transsexuals, it is of utmost importance to critically analyze Trans-sexualizing Process for it might compromise their reproductive capacities and rights.

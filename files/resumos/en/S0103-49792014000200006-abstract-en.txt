This article seeks to begin a discussion on the possibility of using social rent as a way of providing decent housing in Bel√©m's Historical Center. To this end, the article: i) analyzes social rent in Brazilian housing policies; ii) identifies and quantifies, for the Historical Center, the potential demand arising from the housing deficit, as well as potential supply, the latter based on the hypotheses of adapting vacant, underused properties, as well as building housing units in lots either vacant or containing ruins. The study concludes, initially, that there is enough supply to meet the demand in the Historical Center and other areas of the city. Finally, it notes that besides being a housing policy, social rent in historical centers is a conservation policy for the historical and cultural heritage, which adds benefits to be accounted for as the result of a proposed policy.

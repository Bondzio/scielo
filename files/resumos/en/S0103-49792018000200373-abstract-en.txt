This paper analyses the socioeconomic effects of a group of governmental politics of infrastructure and financial/tax subsidies (Programa Grande Carajás) that from the late 1970&#8217;s had established a siderurgical zone for commodities production (pig iron) designed for exportation at the eastern Amazon area of Maranhão state. These governmental efforts trigged the emergence of a labour market around steel and forest workers, by the consequence of the use of charcoal as a input for siderurgical production. The analytic effort will be based on the theoretic paradigm of Global Production Networks, which stands as a multicentric approach that stresses the action of diversified social world actors to understand the process of configuration of that market, focusing the changes caused by the 2008&#8217;s economic crisis, highlighting the role performed by trade unions, corporates and state agents in this process.

Expressions such as "multi-", "pluri-", "inter-" and "transdisciplinarity" have spread out in extraordinary manner in the academic milieu, actually becoming institutional assessment criteria in a number of countries. This paper analyses how disciplines are incorporated in the field of international relations, a recent field of knowledge that expresses quite well the complexity of the contemporary world, with its themes and contents, and that oscillates between the need for acknowledgement as an autonomous discipline and the multidisciplinarity inherent to its internationalistic nature. Following a conceptual overview, we inquire about the use of disciplinary integration as an assessment criterion, especially concerning the international relations curriculum. Lastly, we report on an experiment carried out in this undergraduate course of the Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo.

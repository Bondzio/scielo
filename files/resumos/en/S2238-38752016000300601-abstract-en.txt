Abstract The article approaches a series of films made by indigenous filmmakers in order to demonstrate the variable modes of the off-screen space (invisible one) in its relation with the screen space (visible, phenomenological one). We observe how this cinema is constituted by agencies that actuate from the outside to make the film possible and also to unfold and to "unmake" it. Analyses of sequences from five films enable the demonstration of this hypothesis in a concrete way: Urihi Haromatimape: Curadores da terra-floresta (2013); The hyperwomen (2011); Tatakox da Vila Nova (2009); Shuku Shukuwe: a vida Ã© para sempre (2012) e Bicicletas de Nhanderu (2011).

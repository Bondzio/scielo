Abstract The article analyses the professional career of 45 chairs of Brazilian Central Bank (directorates and presidents). Its purpose is to capture the career structure of these agents, taking into consideration every position throughout their career and the connections among them. Therefore, we use Social Network Analysis, especially its centrality measures (degree and betweeness), and its clustering techniques. The sources consulted were biographies available on the Central Bank&#8217;s website, the curricula used by the Federal Senate to approve the directors, the Bloomberg&#8217;s website, the Bloomberg Professional System, and the Dicionário Histórico Biográfico Brasileiro elaborated by CPDOC. We conclude that the Central Bank&#8217;s directorates and presidents have very complex careers, which combine positions in the public, private and university sectors.

ABSTRACT Three cycles close at this historical juncture and lend the political situation instability and great opacity. They are the object of this article. They are the democratizing cycle begun in the 1970s, the cycle that had the Workers&#8217; Party as absolutely hegemonic in the left and, finally, a shorter one, relative to the Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff governments. Their ends imply also the passage to a new cycle, still undefined, and a possible broad reorganization of the left at the same time that exhaustion of the political system built during this period becomes clear.

Abstract Instigated by the risk of &#8216;cultural loss&#8217; due to growing non-indigenous influence in their villages, the Kuikuro Indians of the Upper Xingu became involved in a wide-ranging project to document their ritual complex. The most well-known aspect of this project is the cinema produced by, or in partnership with, &#8216;indigenous filmmakers&#8217;. In this article, I analyse the specificity of this film production and its primary objective of &#8216;keeping culture&#8217; to prevent its disappearance. We will see how this core idea traverses the two &#8216;paths&#8217; taken by the Kuikuro filmmakers and their partners: first, the so-called &#8216;films of rituals;&#8217; and, second, the films made for non-indigenous audiences. In both cases, we can discern an innovative approach to ritual, whether conducted by the idea of retaining the totality of a specific tradition, or by an attempt to perform the complex relations involved in Kuikuro rituals for spectators from outside the villages.

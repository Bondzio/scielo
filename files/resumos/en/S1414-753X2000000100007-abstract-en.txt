This paper reviews the differences in household perceptions of what constitutes environmental problems, what should be done about them, and who should take action. Built on a household survey undertaken in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, the paper presents the environmental conditions in three selected areas: one central, one intermediate, and one peripheral. People's responses to improve the environment are then compared. In the lower peripheral area, the main concern relates to the lack of service in general, and the major solution would consequently be to expand public investments. The intermediate and central areas are less affected by poor infrastructure; however, they suffer more from air pollution. This is overwhelming in terms of priority in government action. In spite of the differences between central and peripheral regions relating to access to services, both express a very strong dependency on government action.

Our purpose here is to analyse the links between investments in science and technology (S&T) and the growing socio-spatial inequalities in Brazil over recent years. We set out from the premise that Brazil's development remains based on a socioeconomic dynamic of benefit to just a small portion of its population. Our hypothesis, therefore, is that scientific and technological development may be contributing to this increase in inequality, favoured by more substantial investments in S&T in those states and regions where the productive forces are already more developed. To verify this hypothesis we analyse the evolution of investments in S&T (with special attention to social groups and institutions that produce and consume S&T) and the socio-spatial development taking place in Brazil during the last decade.

Abstract: This article analyses the representations of the archipelago of Cape Verde. The complexity of power relations and subordination will be observed from a post-colonial feminist perspective - contextualized in geographical, historical and cultural terms -, and will consider the intersection between the classifications of class, gender and race. This paper is a criticism of the hegemonic representations of Cape Verde and the strategy of silencing the violence of the historical colonial system.

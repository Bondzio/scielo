Abstract This article discusses the mutually constitutive relations between subjects and rights through the analysis of some of the governmental actions to promote gender and race equality in contemporary Brazil (2003-2015). It aims to understand the mechanisms of recognition (and production) of differences linked to a particular conception of the promotion of equal rights in such State processes. The proposal is to reflect on the coproduction and reproduction of meanings that "transversality of gender and race" and the intersectionality perspective acquires in the design of public policies and also on the dynamics of the manufacture of subjects and rights as part inherent to the continuous flow of making State itself.

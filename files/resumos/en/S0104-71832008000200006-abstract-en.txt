This paper aim at analyzing the way the anthropological concept of identity operates among football supporters in a small team of the third division in Argentina, who elaborates their own theories about the passion. In these representations, they construct the difference with their rivals, mixing up class, ethnic and gender references and attitudes towards violence. Then, they are involved in permanent disputes (much of them are very violent) in the supporting of the group honor. In these combats for the identity, the representations are manipulated by groups of power that generate "markets of violence" but reject from the discourse.

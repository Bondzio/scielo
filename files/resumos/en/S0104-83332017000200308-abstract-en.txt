Abstract This article seeks to discuss how gender and sexuality relations operate in the weaving of narratives about violence and how the narrative claim to violence contributes to making gender and sexuality relations. I analyze the narratives employed in the &#8220;Em√≠liacase&#8221; &#8211; a case of rape and murder &#8211; by some of the women who were part of the committee dedicated to uncovering her disappearance. I address three main themes: a) that the &#8220;struggle for justice&#8221; requires the dispute for the victim&#8217;s legitimacy as a victim; b) that, within these disputes, the publicization of intimate pain and suffering usually operates along the outlines of the legitimation of accusations, accusers and victims, mobilizing, for instance, notions of gender related to motherhood; and, lastly, c) that the claims to violence tend to actualize moral conventions surrounding sexuality, such as those involving notions of &#8220;prostitution&#8221; and &#8220;human trafficking&#8221;.

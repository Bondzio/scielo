Abstract This article tries to describe and analyze some inclusion policies established at UFG &#8211; Federal University of Goi√°s. Based on the comparison between two of them, the UFGInclui program and the creation of the NTFSI &#8211; Takinahak&#7929; Indigenous Formation Center, aim to reflect on the university ambiguities, potentialities and transformations. It is hypothesized that the agency of people and collectives is fundamental in the process. And, fundamentally, that the university needs structural transformations for the concrete realization of the inclusion and permanence policies.

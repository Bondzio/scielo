This work describes the editorial project for Revista de estudios de género. La ventana which is a keystone for the charter at the Centro de Estudios de Género of the University of Guadalajara, México. The Journal has been unique in publishing academic contributions on gender studies in México. It has been well received by the academic circles focused on gender studies as well as the community at large interested in the topic, both nationally in México as internationally. The importance of this Journal derives from the need for publishing the conceptual and theoretical advancements in the field as well as the debate produced between the different approaches to the analysis of gender relations as the historical and cultural expressions in the symbolization process of sexual difference. In light of the positive results which the Journal has achieved, the editorial scope will be enlarged to include other specialty publications in the field of gender studies.

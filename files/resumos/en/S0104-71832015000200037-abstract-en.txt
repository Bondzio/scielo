AbstractThis paper considers how the study of culture and learning might be of particular relevance to the field of social-cultural anthropology more generally. The most important term in the phrase &#8220;culture and learning&#8221; may be the ampersand -- the question of what connects culture and learning, asking how are they related. How should we understand culture and learning to produce themselves and each other, in practice? Recalibrated in relational terms, you cannot address &#8220;learning&#8221; or &#8220;culture and learning&#8221; without entanglement in political-economic life, historical divisions and struggles, coherences and incoherencies, in the historical relational production of everyday life. Through the lens of social practice theory ethnographic studies of learning in practice offer different understandings of how that life, those divisions and incoherencies are produced.

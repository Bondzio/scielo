Abstract In this introduction to the Contemporary Political Theory dossier, we seek, through a reflection on the issues of plurality and pluralism, to address the fact that nowadays political theory presents a multiplicity of vocabularies and practices. In this manner, we introduced five political theory conceptions - classical normative, institutional, historical, empirical and ideological - which were reconstructed by A. Vincent in 2004. These conceptions would have marked out the terrain of the discipline as well as its practice from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present. Next, we seek to justify, in two steps, how plurality and epistemological pluralism are an inescapable part of knowledge production carried out in this field. We conclude that, given the partiality permeating it, the production of knowledge in political theory would achieve better results if it were understood and taken as an open-ended collective enterprise. Finally, we briefly present the articles that make up the dossier.

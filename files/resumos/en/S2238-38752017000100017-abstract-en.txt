Abstract In this interview on Michel Foucault, Roberto Machado discusses his contemporary relevance and his impact on the human sciences; the types of study composing the different periods of his intellectual trajectory; the singular aspects of his thought - the provisional method, the instrumental dimension of knowledge and the attention to the theoretical and political present; as well as the link between his historical-philosophical analyses and his political actions. He recalls Foucault's visit to Brazil during the military dictatorship, the encounter with the French thinker and his work, and the experience of his courses and seminars at the Coll√®ge de France. He also comments on learning about the political dimension of knowledge as a tool for struggle and resistance.

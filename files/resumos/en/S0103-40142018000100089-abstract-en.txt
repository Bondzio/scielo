Abstract This paper reconstitutes the meeting between former Brazilian and French presidents Tancredo Neves and François Mitterrand at Latche on January 26, 1985. It presents the Quai d&#8217;Orsay and Élysée mobilizations and calls attention to the interaction between French and Brazilians diplomats. And it proposes that the Tancredo-Mitterrand moment was the rebirth of French influence in Brazil.

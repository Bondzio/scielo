Para cumprir essa tarefa, os autores analisam os debates que ocorreram   durante o per&iacute;odo em que Bill Clinton governava o pa&iacute;s, quando os debates   globais foram encaminhados. Este trabalho relembra o debate durante o governo   Bush e a crescente polariza&ccedil;&atilde;o desde a ascens&atilde;o de Barack Obama ao poder. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Palavras-chave:</b> pol&iacute;tica clim&aacute;tica; interesses dom&eacute;sticos; Estados Unidos.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The article points out some   of the domestic factors that contribute for understanding the United States   position in international discussions on climate change. Firstly, it shows a   recent and important judicial decision favorable to regulations. The outcome   weakens a conservative strategy to delegitimize scientific findings and public   policies. The second and third parts recall the discussion during the   governments of Bill Clinton (1993&#150;2001) and George W. Bush (2001&#150;2009). The   fourth section deals with the debate during Barack Obama's administration and identifies   key actors, whether individuals or institutions, who allow or prevent progress   in combating environmental regulations. The conclusion states that increasing   conservatism in domestic political spectrum and anti-climate grassroots actions   make improbable any advances on multilateral negotiations.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Pre-electoral scenario in 2012</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The current debate in the US on climate change follows   a political polarization increasingly common in the country. Most of the   Democrats, except those who maintain a conservative view, seek to advance   regulations to minimize global warming effects. Conversely, most Republicans go   beyond the mere attempt to prevent the adoption of environmental laws. Leaders   in the Republican Party build a detraction speech about scientific arguments   that support the veracity of anthropogenic causes of global warming.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The controversy is extended to legal arenas. An   emblematic case is a recent decision of the US Court of Appeals for the   District of Columbia. In&nbsp; June 2012, the judges issued a favorable opinion   regarding the competence of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to   regulate greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The judicial action is due to a   legal process presented by some industries and states to block the power of the   agency.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the most comprehensive environmental   legislation in the country, the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA can regulate emissions   if there is a direct risk to public health or the environment. However, none of   its amendments considers the term "climate change" as a direct or even indirect   threat. Based on such a legal gap, the detractors of climate legislation have   always expected to impede related public policies. The impediment of nationwide   regulations contributes to the continuing stagnation of US position in   international negotiations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The unanimous decision was announced by a panel of   three judges: one conservative, appointed by Ronald Reagan, and two liberals,   nominated by Bill Clinton. The Court found that EPA presented strong scientific   proofs relating emissions of polluting gases, such as carbon dioxide, to global   warming. The judges also found that higher temperatures on Earth negatively   affect environment and therefore people's health. The opinion represents a   victory for President Barack Obama, since the promise of improving climate laws   was one of his political platforms in 2008. The following year, the House of   Representatives passed an ambitious environmental legislation. However, the   proposal was not considered in the Senate, where Senators were not able to vote   anything similar. The Democrat defeat in 2010 elections sealed Obama's efforts.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Court understanding must provide Obama with some   power in case the current electoral contest against the Republican candidate   Mitt Romney includes climate issues. Romney himself is pressured by radical   right-wing groups in his own party to refute environmental protection measures.   The main target of those climate opponents is certainly EPA, whose actions are   commonly categorized as harmful to economy.

Scientific studies conducted by the   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate that this phenomenon   is due to natural causes, but also to the industrial civilization, whose   production mode depends on large-scale use of fossil fuels that generate   greenhouse gas. Human activities cause most of carbon emissions, while thermal   consequences of the consumption of fossil resources can be disastrous for life.   As per International Energy Agency:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continuing on today's path, without new policies, would     mean rapidly increasing dependence on fossil fuels and continuing wasteful use     of energy, taking us towards a concentration of greenhouse gases in the     atmosphere in excess of 1,000 parts per million (ppm) of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent.

In 1990, global concentration of carbon dioxide in the   atmosphere was already 354 ppm against 280 ppm in pre-industrial era.   According to the scientific community, a level above 450 ppm will probably   cause unavoidable environmental disasters. In 2005, the US was responsible for   20% of global emissions.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> However, the belief that economic   development was directly linked to energy consumption delayed actions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last two administrations prior to Barack Obama &#150;   Bill Clinton and George W. Bush &#150; were pressured by the international community   to join agreements in multilateral forums. In 1992, the United Nations   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established the foundations of   a broader discussion among governments and communities. Without proposing goals   and targets, the treaty took the first step in creating a framework for   international collaboration.

Therefore, perceptions over   those implications by domestic sectors prevented the US from an effective   international cooperation.

Elected in 1992, Clinton counted on a Congress controlled by the Democratic   Party in the first two years. That advantage would be lost before the end of   the first term, when Republicans won the general elections in 1994. The   consequence was the recovery, unprecedented since 1950, of the majority of   seats in Congress by the Republican Party.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initially, the President announced plans to tax energy   consumption and to create a program in accordance with the UNFCCC. Both   projects were rejected by Congress while Democrats still controlled it. In   1993, the government presented the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), which   comprised administrative initiatives to reduce GHG emissions in 2000 by 1990   levels. Although its implementation was due to federal government, Congress had   an important control over CCAP since federal agencies relied on   US$ 1.9 billion to be released by Congress. After mid-term elections,   appropriations became a daily battle between Executive and Legislative. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As distribution of legislative seats favored   Republicans, the party leadership adopted a negative posture towards most   federal proposals. In fact, Republicans proposed its own agenda known as   "Contract with America."<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a> The Republican strategy, which   advocated for a minor government intervention on economy, saw CCAP as state   interference in market. In 1997, when emissions were around 13% above 1990   level, Clinton attributed the failure of his energy plan to a financial embargo   by the rival party over nearly 50 programs in CCAP.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Aspects of domestic politics reflected significantly   in US behavior during international negotiations. American delegates questioned   the goals proposed by European Union (EU) and pushed for greater responsibility   from developing countries.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a> Other concern was to make Europeans and   Japanese agreeing to similar parameters in order to avoid that climate change   "externalities" jeopardized competitiveness. According to Rafe Pomerance,   former deputy assistant secretary of State for Environment and Development, the   main objective in the Conference of Parties (COP-1), in Berlin, 1995, was to   avoid EU imposing emission targets.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">International delegates agreed that developing   countries should participate on voluntary basis, without commitment to   pre-established targets. Nowadays, this flexibility is still one of the causes   for resistance by Congress in engaging the country in a global climate regime.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the difficulty in coordinating external and   internal requirements, the Clinton administration has never abandoned   negotiations, as George W. Bush would do later. During COP-2, held in Geneva in   the following year, undersecretary for Global Affairs, Timothy Wirth, said that   the country would consider accepting a legal bind if reduction goals were   realistic. The US would not accept dealing with idealized figures unrelated to   economic reality. Moreover, solutions adopted should be market-oriented, which   meant not only preserving profit margins for industries, but turning   global-warming fight into business. Ecological economics have been on   environmental agenda since the 1960s, but never succeeded in the US and   certainly did not produce the results that were expected in the 1980s.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> Finally, the agreement should be flexible enough to incorporate an increasing   number of countries.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Prior to COP-3, in Kyoto, 1997, the importance of the   treaty was to be stressed for public opinion and decision makers. Therefore, a   task force was created under Todd Stern's leadership, who would become Obama's   special envoy for later international negotiations. The group comprised   officials from several federal agencies, whose assignment was, among other   things, to clarify issues for environmental groups, industrial sectors,   politicians and public opinion.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clinton himself spoke at National Geographic Society   on October 22, 1997. He referred to the climate issue as a global problem of   particular concern in industrialized and developing countries. The President   declared that, despite the uncertainty about the extent of the phenomenon,   scientific findings were solid enough to bring the subject to public and   political spheres. Clinton's goal was to legitimize the issue. Besides that,   bilateral dialogues were initiated with countries like Australia, Japan, Canada   and Russia.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, profound differences emerged in relation to   traditional partners in the old continent. EU proposed to reduce 15% of   emissions in 2000 over 1990 levels. For Washington the focus should be   stabilizing rather than reducing emissions. The nation also disagreed with   other criteria: establishing the same percentage for the entire block and   leaving the responsibility of determining individual limits to the European   Commission. American delegates understood that this would allow Europeans to   create their own trading system for emission quotas.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The efforts to obtain cooperation from domestic   political class were useless. By 95 votes in favor and none against,   Senate approved a bipartisan resolution named Byrd-Hagel (S.Res.98),<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a> introduced by Robert Byrd (D-WV) and Chuck Hagel (R-NE). The resolution   discouraged the signature of the treaty based on the perception that the   instrument would impose limits to American economy and favor developing   countries. Besides having fears of interfering in free market, politicians were   highly influenced by the oil lobby. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to reduce international pressure, government   moved forward internally. Among other federal programs, it established the   Climate Change Technology Initiative (CCTI), which provided   US$ 6.3 billion in investments and tax incentives to increase energy   efficiency in the country.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congress tried to block it by rejecting funds for its   implementation. The greatest criticism, however, was oriented towards EPA,   which Congress rightly believed would be a federal instrument to regulate   carbon emissions. Environmental policy in the US can be implemented at national   level through legislation passed by Congress or by EPA regulation. The agency,   however, could only rule in cases related to human health, since climate change   and global warming were not comprised in any national legislation. Anti-EPA   politicians also try to question the agency's legal authority. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1970, Congress passed the CAA as the first   instrument against emissions in US history. Previous laws, such as the Air   Pollution Control Act of 1955, the Clean Air Act of 1963 and the Air Quality   Act of 1967 dealt with research and development, and pollution control, but   only CAA covered the emissions control. In the same year, former President   Richard Nixon created EPA to consolidate into one agency a variety of activities   under the CAA. After being amended in 1990, CAA expanded its scope to adopt   measures related to individual health and the environment. It is primarily   based on this amendment that EPA has been able to bypass many barriers.</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Clean Air Act (...) defines the Environmental Protection     Agency's responsibilities for protecting and improving the nation's air quality     when a substance has been determined to endanger human health and the     environment.

"In signing the Kyoto Protocol,   the President blatantly contradicts the will of the US Senate" (Chuck Hagel).<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a> But the treaty was never submitted to Senate for ratification. After signing   it, the President faced the most serious crisis in his government. After   admitted involvement in a sex scandal in the White House, Clinton was   threatened by the shadow of impeachment in the following months. Given this   scenario and the Byrd-Hagel Resolution, the chance for ratification had become   void.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the setback, Clinton said &#150; in the State of   the Union speech in January 1999 &#150; that global warming represented the greatest   challenge to the country.

Although it did not   pass, the act differed from the Kyoto Protocol in several respects. Above all,   the proposal rejected the signature of the Treaty based on noncompliance by   developing countries and mandatory provisions for developed ones.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Clinton administration succeeded in opening a   national dialogue, yet this was marked by advances and setbacks. In   international negotiations, the question involved the role of developing   countries, targets reductions over 1990 level, and a mandatory legal   instrument.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The different position between the US and EU became   clear during     COP-6, in The Hague, in 2000. Europeans argued that by regulating emissions in   industrialized countries, a climate regime could take to a lesser consumption   of fossil resources. Climate change strategy based only on free market would   not produce the effects needed to prevent the increase in global warming.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Washington defended other measures such as the   inclusion of agricultural lands and forests as mitigating factors. As these   environments are considered as potential loci for carbon sequestration,   countries with agriculture and forestry vocation would benefit from this methodology.   Considering favorable geographical characteristics of the US, it was believed   that such a determination would allow the country to avoid larger quotas and   restrictions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The country also supported the creation of quotas   trading system. Thus, the most polluting nations would buy surplus emissions   quotas from countries that pollute less.

Bush announced the US would abandon Kyoto negotiations. The   decision was taken in alignment with Byrd-Hagel Resolution. Before the formal   abandonment, Bush sent a letter to Republican Senators Chuck Hagel (R-NE),   Jesse Helms (R-NC), Larry Craig (R-ID) and Pat Roberts (R-KS), which would   symbolize the country position in global forums during his administration.</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As you know, I oppose the Kyoto Protocol because it exempts     80% of the world, including major population centers, such as China and India,     from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy. &#91;...&#93; At a time     when California has already experienced energy shortages, and other Western     states are worried about price and availability of energy this summer, we must     be very careful not to take actions that could harm consumers.

The association Global Climate Coalition, formed by large   petrochemicals, oil and automobiles corporations, led an aggressive campaign to   respond to IPCC and strengthen the perception that climate change was a   scientific creation.

Under the   leadership of Vice President Dick Cheney, the group was intended to address   challenges such as energy blackouts in California, the increase in energy   prices, the reduction in domestic production of natural gas and the dependence   on foreign oil. The fundamental question for the new administration was not   climate, but energy. After 2005, the NEPDG would work to make the country less   dependent on foreign oil by encouraging domestic exploration of oil and gas,   especially on offshore zones and natural reserves. Cheney proposed to move   forward on federal lands, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in   Alaska, a clear setback for climate change.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bush tried to dismantle some programs created by   Clinton, as the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, which aimed to   produce cars with efficiency for 80 miles per gallon.

The reductions should be   achieved through voluntary actions by private sector without government   interference.

The text also highlighted EPA competence to regulate GHG emissions and carbon   credits trade.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The initiative received support from 61 groups of   interest, including Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, One Sky, Clean   Water Action, American Rivers and the Environmental Defense Fund. Its critics   comprised, among others, Greenpeace, American Farm Bureau Federation, Friends   of the Earth, Rainforest Action Network, Public Citizen, and Murray Energy   Corporation.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is noteworthy that the eclectic composition of the   second group includes environmentalists, fossil industries and associations of   consumers and taxpayers. Greenpeace, for example,<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><sup>23</sup></a> believed that the proposal would benefit capitalist interests at the expense of   environment by allowing the purchase of carbon credits by the most polluting   industries. Members of oil industry criticized the law precisely because it   would oblige them to acquire government permissions to offset carbon emissions,   leading to increase in production costs. Finally, taxpayers feared rising of   energy prices.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On June 26, 2009, Waxman-Markey bill was finally   passed in the House of Representatives with a tight margin of 219 votes   (including eight Republicans) against 212. Although the resistance to climate   policies is usually attributed to Republicans, the Democratic majority did not   vote consensually.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the proposal had a short life in Congress since   Senate chose to discuss its own projects, such as the Clean Energy Jobs and   American Power Act (S.1733), introduced by Senators John Kerry (D-MA) and   Barbara Boxer (D-CA). Despite suggesting a 20% reduction on 2005 emissions, the   initiative was considered as more lenient than Waxman-Markey because it made   greater concessions to industries. But the majority leader, Harry Reid (D-NE),   chose not to include Kerry-Boxer bill in the agenda.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kerry rehearsed a new tripartite project with Joseph   Lieberman (I-CT) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to reduce by 17% the GHG emissions   in 2020 over 2005 rates, and 83% by 2050. This second attempt did not receive   support from the majority leader, who preferred to undertake efforts in matters   of immigration, a topic that would be most crucial for his reelection in 2010.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><sup>24</sup></a> The campaign by right-wing groups, like Tea Party and Fox News, also led   conservative Graham, one of its authors, to abandon the initiative.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>25</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since then, many Republicans emphasized their   skepticism about the veracity of climate change as a result of global warming.   The power of this argument among conservatives has been such that a   pre-candidate in Republican primary in 2011/2012, Newt Gingrich, sought to   delink his image from his own past statements.</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I had a dialogue with Senator John Kerry recently and I     started by saying let's stipulate that it is &#91;a&#93; problem that global warming is     going on, that it is conceivable that humans have a role and therefore as a     matter of prudence we ought to have less carbon loading of the atmosphere.     (Gingrich 2007)<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>26</sup></a> </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Social sectors wonder at what moment the Republican   Party so firmly embraced this denial.</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's deeply troubling. It's one thing when people     disagree on the effectiveness of different approaches to fix a problem; it's     worse when they refuse even to believe that a problem exists &#150; despite an     overwhelming scientific consensus that says it does. One of America's major     political parties has, in effect, adopted denial as policy. How did we get     here?<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>27</sup></a> </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides, the resistance against any sort of state   intervention in the economy and the connection with traditional energy sectors   characterize most conservative Congress members. Republicans and moderate Democrats   do not believe either that clean industry generates a significant number of   jobs.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Compared to its predecessor, it can be said that Obama   has taken over the issue in a positive way. The President and his advisers on   matters of energy and climate officially declare their acceptance of scientific   findings and are keen to discuss the matter. Between rhetoric and practice,   however, there is a polarized Congress, the largest fiscal deficit in the   history of the country and the largest economy in the world to reheat.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Obama administration believes that the adoption of   a clean energy model would not only solve climate change, but also economic   problems arising from the loss of competitiveness in recent years. Taking the   lead in innovation and green technology can be a key factor for the US to   maintain its economic and political supremacy.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In discussions on green economy, a strong criticism   that arises in relation to neoclassical theory is that its conception of   production mode does not take into account that natural resources are finite.   Albeit in a cautiously way, it is possible that Obama's team tries to   incorporate the absorption of elements of green economy in a liberal   perspective.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US role in international negotiations on global   warming is profoundly determined by domestic political factors. The greatest   difficulty is to overcome the resistance of political and economic groups, who   see the idea of an international regime to combat climate change as a threat to   economy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides, limits on carbon emissions and energy   efficiency standards are seen as state interference in the largest economy in   the world market. As clean energy industries still demand government incentives   in its initial phase, the change of paradigm faces a strong resistance among   the political class.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, the country's political system allows groups   of interest to influence Congress. Given the seniority of fossil lobbies and   the connection of many Congress members with some states and districts that   produce traditional energy, the enactment of climate laws becomes turbulent and   difficult. Another obstacle to be overcome is the disbelief in scientific   conclusions, including those developed by the IPPC.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More recently, the climate change issue has been   considered as a variable in the competition among countries and regions. EU   uses environmental issue as an important instrument to strengthen its soft   power. Brazil has gained greater respectability, as well as responsibility.   China intervenes in the debate, presenting itself as a country that fosters its   green industry.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The policies experimented by Bill Clinton and Barack   Obama, though shy, showed some progress in these directions. That clearly   indicates greater affinity with the theme among Democrats. However, the rise of   radical political forces became a challenge for Obama's reelection. Moreover,   the emergence of these forces complicates multilateral agreements on climate   change. The US position risks its international prestige, which ends up   impacting the interests of the country in the world.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bibliographic references</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Climate Change 2001:   Synthesis Report.

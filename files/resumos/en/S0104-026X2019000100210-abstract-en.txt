Abstract: In this article, my goal is to tense up the conceptions about sexual exploitation by taking this discussion beyond the victimization-blaming dichotomy. Semi-sctructured interviews were carried out with two highly experienced professionals in attending sheltered youngsters, and documented materials were analyzed - specifically, a police inquiry about a 17-year-old teenager. Girls who are sexually exploited deal with complex issues between the limits of living in a society that at once stimulates consumerism and moralizes their body, gender e sexuality. The challenge here is to consider protection apparatuses that can deal with the vast nuances involved in sexual exploitation, considering the young girls&#8217; own decisions and strategies to deal with situations, without falling into blaming and punishment.

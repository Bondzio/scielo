Abstract This essay discusses the female suicide from gender relations that circumscribe this event. In a historical bias confront female suicides of classical antiquity and the present. The purpose of this essay is multidisciplinary and proposes join two apparently distinct areas of research: one linked to gender issues and the permanence of cultural traits of antiquity in modern society and another on the transgressive essence of suicide today. This essay points to the similarity between the women of classical antiquity, portrayed in the tragedies, and contemporary women in the design of the voluntary deaths.

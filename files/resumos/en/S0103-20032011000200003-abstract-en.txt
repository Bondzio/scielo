The main objective of this study is to evaluate which factors are the determinants of the transportation costs of the Brazilian exports of green coffee, one of the major export products of Brazil. Additionally, it intended to evaluate the impacts that these factors have over the exports of this commodity. First of all, a "type-gravity" model was used, which considered, among other variables, different measures of the variable distance, to find the determinants of the costs of transports of green coffee. In second place, an analysis was accomplished adding to the basic gravity model those variables used to determinate transportation costs. For both estimates, the Tobit method was used with panel data, from 2000 to 2006. Results, as expected, indicated that the expenses with transportation in the green coffee exports are sensitive to distance between Brazil and their commercial partners. In other words, the higher the distance, the higher the transportation costs. In the analysis of green coffee exports, the distance between countries and the absence of a coast in importing countries have affected more the transportation costs, becoming barriers to green coffee exports.

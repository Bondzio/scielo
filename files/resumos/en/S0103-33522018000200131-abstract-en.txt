Abstract This article analyzes the interactive public hearings promoted by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, based on the direct monitoring of the audiences during the year 2015 through the internet. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with the teams responsible for the management of interactive audiences and a survey of participating citizens. The theoretical framework focuses on specific aspects of political sociology and political science, favoring approaches to online deliberation. The data show the predominance of the interactions between the citizens themselves, with little parliamentary interlocution. In addition, the research reveals that the interactions focused on the deliberation itself are in the background, with the predominance of elements typical of everyday conversation. Nonetheless, the poll conducted with citizens shows their enthusiasm for participation. The discussion shows that public interactive audiences go beyond the informational function identified in the literature. The results indicate new contributions from the audience in the virtual format, such as the formation of communities of interest, exchanges of opinions and experiences among the interacting citizens and citizen vigilance on the activities of the parliament.

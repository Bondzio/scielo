The present work sets up an interdisciplinary attempt of reflection about use and potentialities of life history as generative source of qualitative information. They give necessary information to connect migratory performances of students that enter into Mar del Plata&#8217;s National University (Argentina) with their profesional representation and their cultural consumption as a guide to make decisions to begin on an urban territorial mobility. We understand the representation as the ways that students know and think the reality according to the position they occupy in the social space and they work as a guide of their behavior. Life story instrumentation will give us the possibility to understand how the representations are built, which is their conformation and which functions they fulfill, through the way the migrant themselves live the objetive conditions and build the world in which their life cicles have been gone by and, in a specific moment, they have been led to the migrate&#8217;s decision.

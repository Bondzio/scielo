Abstract During 36 years, Evaristo de Moraes Filho has actively engaged in the life of the University of Brazil, today Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). As a student of the National School of Law from 1933 to 1937, he was heavily influenced by marxist professors. In times of great political and cultural effervescence, Evaristo was a major participant in the cultural and political life of Rio de Janeiro, especially in the demonstrations against integralism. In 1939, he entered the Faculty of Philosophy, graduating in 1949. His activities as a teacher began that same year. Later he became a distinguished scholar in the Faculty of Philosophy and in the Faculty of Law. Lecturer in Sociology and Full Professor in Labour Law, Evaristo was one of the creators of the Institute of Social Sciences, which in 1968 would merge with the Faculty of Philosophy to form the current Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Retired by Institutional Act 5, in 1969, Evaristo refused to return to the University after the amnesty in 1979. In 1984, he was elected to the Brazilian Academy of Letters (ABL).

Abstract: I explore the symbolic keys of the Spanish bullfight, as well as those embedded in the growing anti-bullfight movement. Notwithstanding their rampant antagonism, bullfight lovers and bullfight haters share a stand against the &#8220;modern&#8221; nature/culture (animal/human) divide. They both build, albeit in a divergent fashion, an identification between the humans and their chosen animals. This identification, that in bullfight redirects to the classical anthropological theme of sacrifice &#8211; is grounded on sex and gender conceptions.

In a context where the oral tradition is so present as at Rio Grande do Sul Campaign, Argentina and Uruguai boarders, the observation of the performance of tellers of &#8220;causos&#8221; allows the consideration that they are inserted in a complex narrative event (Bauman, 1989), where the different tellers incorporate and reproduce (incorporated knowlewdge &#8211; Harstrup, 1994), in action itself of telling, the group memory aspects. This memory comes up not only in terms of the narrative contents &#8212; in the referred imaginary &#8211; but through their own corporal intrinsic vocalization and action to the transmission of those narratives (Zumthor, 1993, 1997). To analyse the performance of those tellers through the relationship between memory and corporeality, I was selected four ways. The first one seeks to identify in which way the characterized cultural interchange of this that is a border region which is manifested in the body and voice of the tellers. The second way is regarded to tellers body formation in their everyday work. The third analyze seeks the relations between the corporeality and environment (landscape) and the last one shows the tellers corporeality constitution of the cases from the historical experience emphasized in the region and in the war.

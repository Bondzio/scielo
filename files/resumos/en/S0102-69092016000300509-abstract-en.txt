This article offers a contribution to the comparative study of social and political thought elaborated in the global periphery. By tracing parallels and exploring divergent positions, the objective is to analyze the thought of José Carlos Mariátegui, Léopold Sédar Senghor e Kwame Nkrumah, arguing that their trajectories as politically committed intellectuals in the global periphery brought to them similar theoretical challenges. Three main issues are presented as keys for such comparison, given their centrality in each of the authors&#8217; work: a project of emancipation based on socialism, an idea of modernity that is articulated with pre-colonial societal elements from Latin America and Africa, and the necessity of a regional identity that served as base for a sense of community alternative to the colonial legacy. These elements will be discussed along the three sections that structure the text.

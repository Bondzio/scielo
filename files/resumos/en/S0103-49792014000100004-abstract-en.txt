This paper aims to establish a dialectical connection between the concept of immaterial labor and the cycle of material labor in the production and reproduction of capital and in bourgeois society. In the same way, its purpose is to consider some hypotheses related to the way that immaterial labor affects the shaping of social classes - and their struggle - in contemporary capitalist society.

ABSTRACT This article analyzes a social inclusion policy, the Welcome Rooms policy, and its relationship with the Urban Projovem program (National Youth inclusion program). Such a policy refers back to the present debate on the care economy, particularly as regards the participation of cheap female workforce that would involve affects and services akin to domestic ones, dubbed as &#8220;women&#8217;s work, albeit with specific characteristics since it also involves the issue of professionalization via children&#8217;s education. This study is based on research undertaken in 15 Brazilian municipalities, between 2013 and 2015, which deals with Welcome Rooms for the children (aged 0 to 8) of the Urban Projovem students, in order to facilitate their participation in the program. It combines empirical analysis and the current discussions on care economy and gender.

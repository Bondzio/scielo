Preliminary Observations</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">May I at first express a firm warning against    the negative effects of the fact that, in a "globalized" world &#150; the new euphemism    <I>en vogue</I>, &#150; frontiers are opened to capitals, goods and services, but    regrettably not to human beings. National economies are opened to speculative    capitals, at the same time that the labour conquests of the last decades erode.    Increasing segments of the population appear marginalized and excluded from    material "progress". Lessons from the past seem forgotten, the sufferings of    previous generations appear to have been in vain. The current state of affairs    appears devoid of a historical sense. To this <I>de-historization</I> of the    lifetime are added the idolatry of the market, reducing human beings to mere    agents of economic production (ironically, amidst growing unemployment in distinct    latitudes).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a result of this new contemporary tragedy    &#150; essentially a man-made one, &#150; perfectly avoidable if human solidarity were    to have primacy over individual egoism, there emerges and intensifies the new    phenomenon of massive flows of forced migration, &#150; of millions of human beings    seeking to escape no longer from individualized political persecution, but rather    from hunger and misery, and armed conflicts, &#150; with grave consequences and implications    for the application of the international norms of protection of the human person.    One decade ago, in a study I prepared for the Inter-American Institute of Human    Rights (in Costa Rica, in 1998), published in 2001 in Guatemala, I propounded    a human rights approach for the phenomenon of forced migratory fluxes, &#150; distinctly    from the classic studies on the subject (pursuant to a strictly historical,    or else economic, approach), &#150; and with attention focused on human beings experiencing    great vulnerability<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><sup>1</sup></a>. On the    occasion, I saw it fit to warn that:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"The advances &#91;in this domain&#93; will only be      achieved by means of a radical change of mentality. In any scale of values,      considerations of a humanitarian order ought to prevail over those of an economic      or financial order, over the alleged protectionism of the market of work and      over group rivalries. There is, definitively, pressing need to situate the      human being in the place that corresponds to him, certainly above capitals,      goods and services. This is perhaps the major challenge of the "globalized"      world in which we live, from the perspective of human rights"<a name="tx02"></a><a href="#nt02"><sup>2</sup></a>.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this article, I shall retake the subject,    which has become a topical one, with the purpose of identifying and gathering    the elements, accumulated in recent years, that would allow to advance further    the aforementioned new approach, proper to human rights, to the consideration    of the contemporary phenomenon of forced migrations. To this end, I shall seek    to portray the drama of uprootedness and the growing need of protection of migrants,    and to identify the basic principles applicable in this new domain of protection    of the human person; and shall review the growing international case-law on    the matter (of both the European and the Inter-American Courts of Human Rights,    as well as other initiatives of protection at the United Nations and regional    levels, the implications of the whole issue for the responsibility of States,    and its importance for the international community as a whole. The path will    then be opened for the presentation of my final reflections on the matter.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>II. The Drama of Uprootedness and the Growing    Need of Protection of Migrants</b></font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been rightly warned that humankind can    only achieve true progress when it moves forward in the sense of human emancipation<a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><sup>3</sup></a>.    It is never to be forgotten that the State was originally conceived for the    realization of the common good<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><sup>4</sup></a>.    No State can consider itself to be above the Law, the norms of which have as    ultimate addressees the human beings; in sum, the State exists for the human    being, and not <I>vice versa</I>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Paradoxically, the expansion of "globalization"    has been accompanied <I>pari passu</I> by the erosion of the capacity of the    States to protect the economic, social and cultural rights of the persons under    their jurisdictions; hence the growing needs of protection of refugees, displaced    persons and migrants, in this first decade of the XXIst. century, &#150; what requires    solidarity at universal scale<a name="tx05"></a><a href="#nt05"><sup>5</sup></a>.    This great paradox appears rather tragic, bearing in mind the considerable advances    in science and technology in the last decades, which, nevertheless, have not    been able to reduce or erradicate human egoism<a name="tx06"></a><a href="#nt06"><sup>6</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tragically, the material progress of some has    been accompanied by the closing of frontiers to human beings and the appearance    of new and cruel forms of human servitude (clandestine traffic of persons, forced    prostitution, labour exploitation, among others), of which undocumented migrants    are often victims<a name="tx07"></a><a href="#nt07"><sup>7</sup></a>. The increasing    controls and current hardships imposed upon migrants have led some to behold    and characterize a contemporary situation of "crisis" of the right of asylum<a name="tx08"></a><a href="#nt08"><sup>8</sup></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Migrations and forced displacements, increased    and intensified from the nineties onwards<a name="tx09"></a><a href="#nt09"><sup>9</sup></a>,    have been characterized particularly by the disparities in the conditions of    life between the country of origin and that of destination of migrants. Their    causes are multiple, namely: economic collapse and unemployment, collapse in    public services (education, health, among others), natural disasters, armed    conflicts generating fluxes of refugees and displaced persons, repression and    persecution, systematic violations of human rights, ethnic rivalries and xenophobia,    violence of distinct forms<a name="tx10"></a><a href="#nt10"><sup>10</sup></a>.    In recent years, the so-called "flexibility" in labour relations, amidst the    "globalization" of the economy, has also generated mobility, accompanied by    personal insecurity and a growing fear of unemployment<a name="tx11"></a><a href="#nt11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Migrations and forced displacements, with the    consequent uprootedness of so many human beings, bring about traumas. Testimonies    of migrants give account of the sufferings of the abandonment of home, at times    with family separation or disaggregation, of loss of property and personal belongings,    of arbitrarinesses and humiliations on the part of frontier authorities and    security agents, generating a permanent feeling of injustice<a name="tx12"></a><a href="#nt12"><sup>12</sup></a>.    As Simone Weil warned already in the mid-XXth century, "To be rooted is perhaps    the most important and least recognized need of the human soul. It is one of    the hardest to define"<a name="tx13"></a><a href="#nt13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time and in the same line of thinking,    Hannah Arendt warned for the sufferings of the uprooted (the loss of home and    of the familiarity of day-to-day life, the loss of profession and of the feeling    of usefulness to the others, the loss of the mother tongue as spontaneous expression    of feelings), as well as the illusion to try to forget the past<a name="tx14"></a><a href="#nt14"><sup>14</sup></a>.    Also in this line of reasoning, in his book <I>Le retour du tragique</I> (1967),    J.-M. Domenach observed that one can hardly deny the<I> roots</I> of the human    spirit itself, since the very form of aquisition of knowledge on the part of    each human being, &#150; and consequently his way of seeing the world, &#150; is to a    large extent conditioned by factors such as the place of birth, the mother tongue,    the cults, the family and the culture<a name="tx15"></a><a href="#nt15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In his novel <I>Le temps des d&eacute;racin&eacute;s</I>    (2003), Elie Wiesel<a name="tx16"></a><a href="#nt16"><sup>16</sup></a> remarked    the former refugees continue somehow to be refugees for the rest of their lives;    they escape from one exile to project themselves into another, everything looking    provisional, and without feeling at home anywhere. They always keep on remembering    where they originally come from<a name="tx17"></a><a href="#nt17"><sup>17</sup></a>,    cultivating their memories as a means of defending themselves of their adverse    condition of uprooted persons. But the "celebration of memory" has also its    limitations, as the uprooted are deprived of horizons, and of the sense of belonging    to somewhere<a name="tx18"></a><a href="#nt18"><sup>18</sup></a>. They always    need help from others. The drama of the victimized seems to be overlooked and    forgotten as time passes by, and the uprooted end up by having to learn to live    with the slow and ineluctable diminution even of their own memories<a name="tx19"></a><a href="#nt19"><sup>19</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In my Separate Opinion in the case of the <I>Moiwana    Community versus Suriname</I> before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights    (Judgment of 06.15.2005), I dwelt upon precisely the projection of human suffering    in time of the migrants of that Community (some of whom had fled to French Guyana)    who survived a massacre (perpetrated on 11.29.1986 in the N'djuka Maroon village    of Moiwana, in Suriname). I charaterized the harm they suffered as </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">a spiritual one. Under their culture, they      remain still tormented by the circumstances of the violent deaths of their      beloved ones, and the fact that the deceased did not have a proper burial.      This privation, generating spiritual suffering, has lasted for almost twenty      years, from the moment of the perpetration of the 1986 massacre engaging the      responsibility of the State until now. The N'djukas have not forgotten their      dead (par. 29).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Only with the aforementioned Judgment of 2005,    almost two decades later, they at last found redress, with the judicial recognition    of their suffering and the reparations ordered. In the framework of these latter    stands the securing by the State of their voluntary and safe return to their    native lands<a name="tx20"></a><a href="#nt20"><sup>20</sup></a>. This was not    the first time that I addressed the issue of the projection of human suffering    in time and the growing tragedy of uprootedness; earlier on, I had also done    so in my Concurring Opinion (pars. 1-25) in this Court's Order of Provisional    Measures of Protection (of 18.08.2000) in the case of the <I>Haitians and Dominicans    of Haitian Origin in the Dominican Republic</I>, as well in my Separate Opinion    (pars. 10-14) in the <I>B&aacute;maca Vel&aacute;squez versus Guatemala</I>    case (Reparations, Judgment of 02.22.2002)<a name="tx21"></a><a href="#nt21"><sup>21</sup></a>,    and retook the point at issue the more recent <I>Moiwana Community</I> case<a name="tx22"></a><a href="#nt22"><sup>22</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact, the projection of human suffering in    time (its temporal dimension) has been properly acknowledged, e.g., in the final    document of the U.N. World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination,    Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (Dunbar, 2001), its adopted Declaration and    Programme of Action. In this respect, it began by stating that:</font></p>     <blockquote>        ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are conscious of the fact that the history      of humanity is replete with major atrocities as a result of gross violations      of human rights and believe that lessons can be learned through remembering      history to avert future tragedies (par. 57).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It then stressed the "importance and necessity    of teaching about the facts and truth of the history of humankind", with a view    to "achieving a comprehensive and objective cognizance of the tragedies of the    past" (par. 98). In this line of thinking, the Durban final document acknowledged    and profounding regretted the "massive human suffering" and the "tragic plight"    of millions of human beings caused by the atrocities of the past; it then called    upon States concerned "to honour the memory of the victims of past tragedies",    and affirmed that, wherever and whenever these occurred, "they must be condemned    and their recurrence prevented" (par. 99). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Durban Conference final document attributed    particular importance to remembering the crimes and abuses of the past, in emphatic    terms:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We emphasize that remembering the crimes or      wrongs of the past, wherever and whenever they occurred, unequivocally condemning      its racist tragedies and telling the truth about history, are essential elements      for international reconciliation and the creation of societies based on justice,      equality and solidarity (par. 106).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It at last recognized that "historical injustices"    had undeniably contributed to the poverty, marginalization and social exclusion,    instability and insecurity affecting so many people in distinct parts of the    world (par. 158).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As well pointed out by Jaime Ruiz de Santiago,    the drama of refugees and migrants, &#150; of the uprooted in general, &#150; can only    be properly dealt with in a spirit of true human solidarity towards the victimized<a name="tx23"></a><a href="#nt23"><sup>23</sup></a>.    Definitively, only the firm determination of reconstruction of the international    community<a name="tx24"></a><a href="#nt24"><sup>24</sup></a> on the basis of    human solidarity<a name="tx25"></a><a href="#nt25"><sup>25</sup></a> can lead    to mitigating or alleviating some of the sufferings of the uprooted (whether    refugees, internally displaced persons, or migrants).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>III. Basic Principles on Internal Displacement</b></font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In the last three decades, the problem of internal    displacement has challenged the very bases of the international norms of protection,    demanding an <I>aggiornamento</I> of these latter and new responses to a situation    not originally foreseen at the time of the drafting or elaboration of the relevant    international instruments. These latter have revealed flagrant insufficiencies,    such as, for example, the original lack of norms expressly directed to overcome    the alleged non-applicability of the norms of protection no non-State actors,    the non-tipification of internal displacement under the original norms of protection,    and the possibility of restrictions or derrogations undermining protection in    critical moments. Such insufficiencies have generated initiatives of protection    at both global (United Nations) and regional (Latin American) levels, &#150; initiatives    which have sought a conceptual framework which allows the development responses,    at operative level, to the new needs of protection. It is quite proper to move    on to a brief review of those initiatives.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>1. Global (United Nations) Level</b></font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">At global (U.N.) level, one decade ago, in the    first trimester of 1998, the former U.N. Commission on Human Rights, bearing    in mind the reports by the U.N. Secretary-General's Representative on Internally    Displaced Persons (F.M. Deng)<a name="tx26"></a><a href="#nt26"><sup>26</sup></a>,    at last adopted the so-called Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement<a name="tx27"></a><a href="#nt27"><sup>27</sup></a>,    despite the persistence of the problem of internal displacement along mainly    the last two decades. The basic purpose of the <B>Guiding Principles</B> is    that of reinforcing and strengthening the already existing means of protection;    to this effect, the proposed new principles apply both to governments and insurgent    groups, at all stages of the displacement. The basic principle of <I>non-discrimination</I>    occupies a central position in the aforementioned document of 1998<a name="tx28"></a><a href="#nt28"><sup>28</sup></a>,    which cares to list the same rights, of internally displaced persons, which    other persons in their country enjoy<a name="tx29"></a><a href="#nt29"><sup>29</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The aforementioned 1998 Guiding Principles determine    that the displacement cannot take place in a way that violates the rights to    life, to dignity, to freedom and security of the affected persons<a name="tx30"></a><a href="#nt30"><sup>30</sup></a>;    they also assert other rights, such as the right to respect for family life,    the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to equality before the    law, the right to education<a name="tx31"></a><a href="#nt31"><sup>31</sup></a>.    The basic idea underlying the whole document<a name="tx32"></a><a href="#nt32"><sup>32</sup></a>    is in the sense that the internally displaced persons do not lose their inherent    rights, as a result of displacement, and can invoke the pertinent international    norms of protection (of both International Human Rights Law and International    Humanitarian Law) to safeguard their rights.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a significant resolution adopted in 1994,    the then U.N. Commission on Human Rights, bearing in mind in particular the    problem of internally displaced persons, recalled the relevant norms of, altogether,    International Human Rights Law and International Humanitarian Law, as well as    International Refugee Law, of pertinence to the problem at issue<a name="tx33"></a><a href="#nt33"><sup>33</sup></a>.    Resolution 1994/68, adopted by the Commission on 03.09.1994, further recalled    the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (adopted by the II World    Conference on Human Rights), which called for "a comprehensive approach by the    international community with regard to refugees and displaced persons"<a name="tx34"></a><a href="#nt34"><sup>34</sup></a>.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It stressed the "humanitarian dimension" of "the    problem of internally displaced persons and the responsibilities this poses    for States and the international community"<a name="tx35"></a><a href="#nt35"><sup>35</sup></a>.

The first one, the Declaration of Cartagena,    was motivated by urgent needs generated by a concrete crisis of great proportions;    to the extent that this crisis was being overcome, due in part to that Declaration,    its legacy began to project itself to other regions and subregions of the American    continent.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second Declaration was adopted amidst a distinct    crisis, a more diffuse one, marked by the deterioration of the socio-economic    conditions of wide segments of the population in distinct regions. In sum, Cartagena    and San Jos&eacute; were product of their time. The<I> aggiornamento</I> of    the Colloquy of San Jos&eacute; gave likewise a special emphasis on the identification    of the <I>needs of protection</I> of the human being in any circumstances<a name="tx38"></a><a href="#nt38"><sup>38</sup></a>.    There remained no place for the <I>vacatio legis</I><a name="tx39"></a><a href="#nt39"><sup>39</sup></a>.    The 1994 Declaraci&oacute;n of San Jos&eacute; gave a special emphasis not only    on the whole problem of internal displacement, but also, more widely, on the    challenges presented by the new situations of human uprootedness in Latin America    and the Caribbean, including the forced migratory movements originated by causes    differents from those foreseen in the Declaration of Cartagena. </font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">The 1994 Declaration recognized that the violation    of human rights is one of the causes of forced displacements and that therefore    the protection of those rights and the strengthening of the democratic system    constitute the best measure for the search of durable solutions, as well as    for the prevention of conflicts, the exoduses of refugees and the grave humanitarian    crises<a name="tx40"></a><a href="#nt40"><sup>40</sup></a>.

Yet, the problem of forced migrations has a wider dimension, and    presents a considerable challenge nowadays to the international community as    a whole. Only along the nineties the larger problem of the fluxes of forced    migrations was identified and began to be dealt with as such, in a systematized    way.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>IV.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The causes of forced migrations are not fundamentally    distinct from those of populational forced displacement: natural disasters,    chronic poverty, armed conflicts, generalized violence, systematic violations    of human rights<a name="tx50"></a><a href="#nt50"><sup>50</sup></a>. In the    former U.N. Commission on Human Rights, it was pointed out that, in the mid-nineties,    the challenge presented by this new phenomenon should be examined in the context    of the reality of the post-cold war world, as a result of the multiple internal    conflicts, of ethnic and religious character, repressed in the past but irrupted    in recent years precisely with the end of the cold war<a name="tx51"></a><a href="#nt51"><sup>51</sup></a>.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To these latter is added the growth of chronic    poverty<a name="tx52"></a><a href="#nt52"><sup>52</sup></a>. To face this new    phenomenon of forced migrations, the U.N. General Assembly approved, on 12.18.1990,    the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant    Workers and Members of their Families. Such important Convention, which at last    entered into force on 07. 01.2003, has, however, received very few ratifications,    &#150; 36 so far (beginning of April 2007), &#150; and has not yet been sufficiently dwelt    upon by contemporary doctrine, despite its considerable significance. The 1990    Convention established the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All    Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families as its supervisory organ (Article    72), entrusted with the examination of State reports (Articles 73-74) as well    as inter-State and individual communications or complaints (Articles 76-77).    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the mid-nineties, the then U.N. Centre for    Human Rights identified the caused of contemporary fluxes of migrant workers    in extreme poverty (below subsistence level), search for work, armed conflicts,    personal insecurity or persecution derived from discrimination (on the ground    of race, ethnic origin, colour, religion, language or political opinions)<a name="tx53"></a><a href="#nt53"><sup>53</sup></a>.    The basic idea underlying the International Convention on the Protection of    the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families is that <I>all</I>    migrant workers &#150; thus qualified thereunder &#150; ought to enjoy their human rights    irrespective of their legal situation<a name="tx54"></a><a href="#nt54"><sup>54</sup></a>.    </font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Hence the central position occupied, also in    this context, by the principle of <I>non-discrimination</I> (as set forth in    its Article 7). Not surprisingly, the list of protected rights follows a necessarily    holistic or integral vision of human rights (comprising civil, political, economic,    social and cultural rights). The Convention took into account both the international    labour standards (derived from the experience of the ILO &#150; cf. <I>infra</I>),    as well as those of the U.N. Conventions against discrimination<a name="tx55"></a><a href="#nt55"><sup>55</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">The protected rights are enunciated in three    of the nine parts which conform the Convention: Part III (Articles 8-35) lists    the human rights of <I>all</I> migrant workers and the members of their families    (including the <I>undocumented ones</I>); Part IV (Articles 36-56) covers other    rights of migrant workers and members of their families "who are documented    or in a regular situation"; and Part V (Articles 57-63) contains provisions    applicable to "particular categories" of migrant workers and members of their    families<a name="tx56"></a><a href="#nt56"><sup>56</sup></a>. </font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">The basic principle of <I>non-discrimination</I>,    which has a rather long history and to which so much importance was ascribed    in the drafing process of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights<a name="tx57"></a><a href="#nt57"><sup>57</sup></a>,    and which subsequently became the main object of two important Conventions of    the United Nations (CERD, 1966, and CEDAW, 1979), &#150; which cover only some of    its aspects, &#150; has, only in recent years, been dwelt upon to a greater depth    in its wide potential of application, as in the Advisory Opinions ns. 16 and    18 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, on <I>The Right to Information    on Consular Assistance in the Framework of the Guarantees of the Due Process    of Law</I> (1999), and on <I>The Juridical Condition and Rights of the Undocumented    Migrants</I> (2003), respectively.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As, in the view of States, there is no human    right to immigrate, the control of migratory entries is made subject to their    own "sovereign" criteria, also to "protect" their internal markets<a name="tx58"></a><a href="#nt58"><sup>58</sup></a>.    Furthermore, instead of devising and applying true population policies bearing    in mind human rights, most States have been exerting the strictly police function    of "protecting" their own frontiers and controlling migratory fluxes, and sanctioning    the so-called "illegal" migrants. The whole issue has been unduly and unnecessarily    "criminalized".</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is thus not surprising that inconsistencies    and arbitrarinesses ensue therefrom. These latter are manifested in "democratic    regimes", the administration de justice of which, nevertheless, does not achieve    to free itself from old prejudices against immigrants, even more so when they    are undocumented and poor. The programs of "modernization" of justice, with    international financing, do not dwell upon this aspect, as their main motivation    is to ensure the security of investments (capitals and goods).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This provides a revealing picture of the (reduced)    dimension which public authorities have conferred upon human beings at this    beginning of the XXIst century, placed in a scale of priority inferior to that    attributed to capitals and goods, &#150; in spite of all the struggles of the past,    and all the sufferings of previous generations. The area in which most incongruencies    appear manifest nowadays is in effect the one pertaining to the guarantees of    the due process of law. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet, the reaction of Law has become prompt and    manifest in our days, as demonstrated, for example, by the pioneering Advisory    Opinions ns. 16 and 18 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, on <I>The    Right to Information on Consular Assistance in the Framework of the Guarantees    of the Due Process of Law</I> (1999), and on <I>The Juridical Condition and    Rights of the Undocumented Migrants</I> (2003), respectively. The Advisory Opinion    n. 16 has placed the right to consular notification, set forth in Article 36(1)    (b) of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in the conceptual universal    of International Human Rights Law. It has indeed conferred a human rights dimension    to some postulates of classic consular law, as I pointed out in my Concurring    Opinion (pars. 1-35)<a name="tx59"></a><a href="#nt59"><sup>59</sup></a> in    the Court's aforementioned 16th.

<body><![CDATA[<p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Since it was issued by the Court, the 16th.    Advisory Opinion, besides inspiring the international case-law <I>in statu nascendi</I>,    has had a considerable impact on international practice in the American continent    (more particularly, in Latin America<a name="tx60"></a><a href="#nt60"><sup>60</sup></a>.    Yet, there is much need of greater and genuine international cooperation to    secure assistance to, and protection of, all migrants and members of their families.    Legal norms can hardly be effective without the corresponding and underlying    values, and, in the present domain, the application of the relevant norms of    protection does require a fundamental change of mentality.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In relation to the subject at issue, the norms    already exist, but the proper acknowledgment of values seem to be still lacking,    as well as a new mentality. It is not mere casuality that the International    Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members    of their Families, despite having entered into force on 07.01.2003, as already    pointed out, has not many ratifying States so far<a name="tx61"></a><a href="#nt61"><sup>61</sup></a>    (cf. <I>supra</I>). Despite the identity of the basic principles and of the    applicable law in distinct situations, the protection of migrants requires,    nevertheless, a special emphasis on one and the other aspect in particular.    The starting-point seems to lie on the recognition that every migrant has the    right to enjoy all the fundamental human rights, as well as the rights derived    from the employments occupied in the past, irrespective of his juridical situation    (whether irregular or not).</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Here, once again, a necessarily holistic or    integral vision of all human rights (civil, political, economic, social and    cultural) applies. Just as the principle of <I>non-refoulement</I> constitutes    the cornerstone of the protection of refugees (as a principle of customary law    and, furthermore, of <I>jus cogens</I>), applicable in other situations as well,    in the matter of migrants (mainly the undocumented ones) it assumes special    importance, beside the due process of law (<I>supra</I>); thus, the fundamental    human rights and the dignity of irregular or undocumented migrants ought to    be preserved also in face of threats of deportation and/or expulsion<a name="tx62"></a><a href="#nt62"><sup>62</sup></a>.    Every person in such a situation has the right to be heard by a judge and not    to be detained ilegally or arbitrarily<a name="tx63"></a><a href="#nt63"><sup>63</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">The International Convention on the Protection    of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families prohibits    measures of collective expulsion, and determines that each case of expulsion    ought to be "examined and decided individually" (Article 22(1)), in accordance    with the law. Given the great vulnerability which accompanies the migrants in    situation of irregularity, the countries of both origin and admission should    take positive measures to ensure that all migrations take place in a regular    way<a name="tx64"></a><a href="#nt64"><sup>64</sup></a>. This is a challenge    to all countries, and even more forcefully to those which purport to be "democratic".    Last but not least, the 1990 Convention ought to be properly appreciated in    conjunction with the <I>1966 U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</I>,    as well the relevant <I>I.L.O. Conventions</I> on the matter<a name="tx65"></a><a href="#nt65"><sup>65</sup></a>.    </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>V.

European Human Rights System</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The theme of aliens or migrants has marked its    presence in the normative and operational levels of the European system of human    rights protection. Thus, Protocol n. 4 (of 1963) to the European Convention    on Human Rights effectively prohibits the collective expulsion of foreigners    (Article 4). And even in individual cases, if the expulsion of a foreigner generates    a separation of the members of the family unit, it brings about a violation    of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights; accordingly, the States    Parties to this latter no longer have total discretionality to expell from their    territory foreigners who already have established a "genuine link" with them<a name="tx66"></a><a href="#nt66"><sup>66</sup></a>.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The limits of State discretionality as the treatment    of any persons under the jurisdiction of the States Parties to human rights    treaties were stressed, e.g., in the well-known early cases of the <I>East African    Asians</I>. In those cases, the old European Commission of Human Rights concluded    that 25 of the complainants (who had retained their status of British citizens    after the independence of Kenya and Uganda to see themselves free from migratory    controls) had been victimized by a new British law which put an end to the right    of entry of British citizens who did not have ancestral links with the United    Kingdom. In the understanding of the old European Commission (Report of 1973),    this law constituted an act of racial discrimination which characterized a "degrading    treatment" in the terms of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights<a name="tx67"></a><a href="#nt67"><sup>67</sup></a>.    </font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Years later, the same European Commission confirmed    its position on the matter, in the case <I>Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali    versus United Kingdom</I> (1983), wherein it warned the State discretionality    in the matter if immigration has its limits, as a State cannot, e.g., implement    policies based upon racial discrimination<a name="tx68"></a><a href="#nt68"><sup>68</sup></a>.    The case was referred to the European Court by the Commission, as the three    applicants (Mrs. Abdulaziz, Mrs. Cabales and Mrs. Balkandali, lawfully and permanently    settled in the United Kingdom, had been refused to join their husbands in that    country). On its turn, the European Court, in its Judgment (1985) found a violation,    not of Article 8 <I>per se</I>, but of Article 8 (respect for private and family    life) together with Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination), by reason of    discrimination on the ground of sex<a name="tx69"></a><a href="#nt69"><sup>69</sup></a>.    </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition, in the case <I>Abdulaziz, Cabales    and Balkandali</I>, the Court further established a violation of 13 of the Convention,    for lack of access to justice; the Court pondered that</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"the discrimination on the ground of sex of      which Mrs. Abdulaziz, Mrs. Cabales and Mrs. Balkandali were victims was the      result of norms that were in this respect incompatible with the Convention.      In this regard, since the United Kingdom has not incorporated the Convention      into its domestic law, there could be no "effective remedy" as required by      Article 13"<a name="tx70"></a><a href="#nt70"><sup>70</sup></a>.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In his Concurring Opinion in the <I>Abdulaziz,    Cabales and Balkandali</I> case, Judge R. Bernhardt aptly argued that:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"Article 13 must, in my view, be given a meaning      which is independent of the question whether any other provision of the Convention      is in fact violated. Whenever a person complains that one of the provisions      of the Convention itself or any similar guarantee or principle contained in      the national legal system is violated by a national (administrative or executive)      authority, Article 13 is in my view applicable and some remedy must be available"<a name="tx71"></a><a href="#nt71"><sup>71</sup></a>.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In spite of the fact that the European Convention    itself did not contemplate the right not to be expelled from on the States Parties,    very soon in the operation of the European Convention it was accepted that there    were limits to the faculty of the States Parties to control the entry and departure    of foreigners, virtue of the obligations contracted under the Convention itself,    as illustrated, e.g., by those pertaining to Article 8 (on the right to respect    for private and family life). Thus, although there does not exist a general    definition of "family life", very soon a protecting case-law was developed in    this respect, in the light of the circumstances of each concrete case. Such    case-law, bearing in mind, <I>inter alia</I>, the principle of proportionality,    has stipulated restrictively the conditions of expulsion<a name="tx72"></a><a href="#nt72"><sup>72</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">A study of the protection of migrant workers    in the International Law of Human Rights has recalled that, on several occasions,    the European Court found "an infringement of the right to respect for family    life in cases involving second-generation migrants, who had either been expelled,    or were under threat of expulsion, because they had been convicted of criminal    offences in their country of residence"<a name="tx73"></a><a href="#nt73"><sup>73</sup></a>.    Although in each case the expulsions, or threatened expulsions, aimed at preventing    disorder or crime, they constituted &#150; the study went on, recalling <I>inter    alia</I> the Court's Judgments in the cases of <I>Beldjoudi versus France</I>    (of 03.26.1992) and <I>Moustaquim versus Belgium</I> (of 02.18.1991), &#150; "a disproportionate    means of achieving this aim given that the affected individuals had spent most    of their lives, together with their immediate families, in the countries concerned    and had little or no ties with their country or origin"<a name="tx74"></a><a href="#nt74"><sup>74</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">The <I>Beldjoudi</I> and the <I>Moustaquim</I>    cases, together with the <I>Lamguindaz versus United Kingdom</I> case (1992),    are nowadays regarded as leading cases in this particular respect. As forcefully    argued in another study on the matter, given the links (such as family and social    ties, schooling, understanding of culture and language) between second-generation    migrants and their (new) country of residence, they are <I>de facto</I> citizens,    and their deportation or expulsion would amount to a violation of their right    to private and family life (Article 8 of the European Convention)<a name="tx75"></a><a href="#nt75"><sup>75</sup></a>.    The protection of the human rights of migrants, under given circumstances, has    thus found judicial recognition in the European human rights system. It has    done so also in the inter-American human rights system, which has gone even    further than the European one in this respect, as it will be indicated next.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>2.

Both Opinions were pioneering in contemporary international    case-law (<I>infra</I>), and represent the reaction of Law to situations of    violations of human rights in large scale, of persons who at times find themselves    in total defencelessness. It is thus proper to review, at this stage, the contribution    of those two remarkable Advisory Opinions to the safeguard of the human rights    of undocumented migrants.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>a) The Advisory Opinion on the <I>Right to    Information on Consular Assistance in the Framework of the Due Process of Law</I>    (1999).</b></font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">The Inter-American Court delivered, on 10.01.1999,    the sixteenth Advisory Opinion of its history, on the <I>Right to Information    on Consular Assistance in the Framework of the Due Process of Law</I>. In that    sixteenth Advisory Opinion, of transcendental importance, the Court held that    Article 36 of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations recognizes to    the foreigner under detention individual rights, &#150; among which the right to    information on consular assistance, &#150; to which correspond duties incumbent upon    the receiving State (irrespective of its federal or unitary structure) (pars.    84 and 140).</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">The Inter-American Court pointed out that the    evolutive interpretation and application of the <I>corpus juris</I> of the International    Law of Human Rights have had "a positive impact on International Law in affirming    and developing the aptitude of this latter to regulate the relations between    States and human beings under their respective jurisdictions". The Court thus    adopted the "proper approach" in considering the matter submitted to it in the    framework of "the evolution of the fundamental rights of the human person in    contemporary International Law" (pars. 114-115). The Court stated that "human    rights treaties are living instruments, whose interpretation ought to follow    the evolution of times and the current conditions of life" (par. 114). The Court    made it clear that, in its interpretation of the norms of the American Convention    on Human Rights, it should aim at extending protection in new situations on    the basis of preexisting rights.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Court expressed the view that, for the due    process of law to be preserved, "a defendant must be able to exercise his rights    and defend his interests effectively and in full procedural equality with other    defendants" (par. 117). In order to attain its objectives, "the judicial process    ought to recognize and correct the factors of real unequality" of those taken    to justice (par. 119); thus, the notification, to persons deprived of their    liberty abroad, of their right to communicate with their consul, contributes    to safeguard their defence and the respect for their procedural rights (pars.    121-122).

The Court in this    way linked the right at issue to the evolving guarantees of due process of law,    and added that its non-observance in cases of imposition and execution of death    penalty amounts to an arbitrary deprivation of the right to life itself (in    the terms of Article 4 of the American Convention on Human Rights and Article    6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), with all the    juridical consequences inherent to a violation of the kind, that is, those pertaining    to the international responsibility of the State and to the duty of reparation    (par. 137)<a name="tx79"></a><a href="#nt79"><sup>79</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This 16th.

This historical Advisory Opinion n. 16, furthermore, reveals the impact of the    International Law of Human Rights in the evolution of Public International Law    itself, specifically for having the Inter-American Court been the first international    tribunal to warn that, if non-compliance with Article 36(1) (b) of the Vienna    Convention on Consular Relations of 1963 takes place, it occurs to the detriment    not only of a State Party but also of the human beings at issue<a name="tx83"></a><a href="#nt83"><sup>83</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In the same line of thinking, Advisory Opinion    n. 18 opens new ground for the protection of migrants, in acknowledging the    character of <I>jus cogens</I> of the basic principle of equality and non-discrimination,    and the prevalence of the rights inherent to human beings, irrespective of their    migratory States. Its advisory proceedings counted on an even greater mobilization    (with 12 accredited States, in addition to the UNHCR, several non-governmental    organizations, academic institutions and individuals), the greatest in the whole    history of the Court to date.

In the course of the corresponding advisory    proceedings, which counted on the greatest public participation in the whole    history of the Court, the Court celebrated two public hearings, the first in    its headquarters in San Jos&eacute; of Costa Rica, in February 2003, and the    second outside its headquarters (for the first time in its history), in Santiago    of Chile, in June 2003. The advisory procedure counted with the participation    of twelve accredited States (among which five States intervening in the hearings),    the Inter-American Commission on Human Righs, one agency of the United Nations    (the U.N. High Commission for Refugees &#150; UNHCR), and nine entities of the civil    society and academic circles of several countries of the region, besides the    Central American Council of Human Rights Ombudsmen &#91;Attorneys-General&#93;.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On 17 September 2003 the Inter-American Court    of Human Rights delivered its 18th Advisory Opinion (requested by Mexico), on    the <I>Juridical Condition and Rights of Undocumented Migrants</I>, wherein    it held that States ought to respect and ensure respect of human rights in the    light of the general and basic principle of equality and non-discrimination,    and that any discriminatory treatment with regard to the protection and exercise    of human rights generates the international responsibility of the States. In    the view of the Court, the fundamental principle of equality and non-discrimination    has entered into the domain of <I>jus cogens</I>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Court added that States cannot discriminate    or tolerate discriminatory situations to the detriment of migrants, and ought    to guaranteee the due process of law to any person, irrespective of her migratory    status. This latter cannot be a justification for depriving a person of the    enjoyment and exercise of her human rights, including labour rights. Undocumented    migrant workers have the same labour rights as the other workers of the State    of employment, and this latter ought to ensure respect for those rights in practice.    States cannot subordinate or condition the observance of the principle of equality    before the law and non-discrimination to the aims of their migratory or other    policies.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition, Individual Opinions were presented    by four Judges, all of them being, significantly, Concurring Opinions. In his    extensive Concurring Opinion, the President of the Court, Judge A.A.

It propounds the same the dynamic or evolutive    interpretation of International Human Rights Law heralded by the Inter-American    Court, four years ago, in its pioneering 16th Advisory Opinion, on <I>The Right    to Information on Consular Assistance in the Framework of the Guarantees of    the Due Process of Law </I>(1999)<a name="tx85"></a><a href="#nt85"><sup>85</sup></a>,    which has ever since been a source of inspiration for the international case-law    <I>in statu nascendi</I> on the matter.

The Protection of Migrants in <I>Rapporteur</I>    Systems</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The protection of the human rights of migrants    has indeed become a key issue in the international human rights agenda of this    first decade of the XXIst. century. This is hardly surprising, given the growing    awareness of the relationships between the intensification of migratory fluxes    (from the late eighties onwards), the speedy internationalization of capitalism,    and the growing labour exploitation (generated by the "requirements of capital",    and with the high human costs of unemployment and underemployment, "informality"    in labour relations, search for cheap manpower, impoverishment of livig conditions    of large segments of the population, and concentration of wealth and income    in world scale)<a name="tx86"></a><a href="#nt86"><sup>86</sup></a>. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was all too expected that, in the nineties,    the theme was to become object of increased attention on the part of international    organizations at both universal (United Nations) and regional (Organization    of American States) levels. At global level, lucid voices from within the Office    of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) warned that the UNHCR could    no longer work for the protection only of refugees, but should also take into    account the denial of human rights of internally displaced persons as well as    migrants, and work for their protection, together with that of refugees<a name="tx87"></a><a href="#nt87"><sup>87</sup></a>.    In this connecion, it should not pass unnoticed that the UNHCR actually intervened    in the oral hearings before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, in the    advisory proceedings that led to the adoption by the Inter-American Court of    its Advisory Opinion n. 18 on <I>The Juridical Condition and Rights of the Undocumented    Migrants</I> (of.09.172003)<a name="tx88"></a><a href="#nt88"><sup>88</sup></a>.    </font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, international organizations, prompted    by the new phenomenon of the intensification of fluxes of forced migrations,    have decided &#150; both the United Nations and the Organization of American States    &#150; to insert it into the scheme of work of their respective <I>rapporteur</I>    systems. The mandate of the U.N. Special <I>Rapporteur</I> on the Human Rights    of Migrants was created in 1999, by resolution 1999/44 of the former U.N. Commission    on Human Rights (par. 3). The resolution entrusted the Special <I>Rapporteur</I>    with the tasks of elaboration of reports and undertaking of country visits,    and further requested the Special <I>Rapporteur</I> to examine "ways and means    to overcome the obstacles existing to the full and effective protection of the    human rights of migrants"<a name="tx89"></a><a href="#nt89"><sup>89</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Resolution 1999/44 drew attention to the "large    and increasing number of migrants in the world" in a "situation of vulnerability",    and stressed "the need for a focused and consistent approach towards migrants    as a specific vulnerable group"<a name="tx90"></a><a href="#nt90"><sup>90</sup></a>.    In pursuance of that mandate, a series of reports have been prepared and presented    by the Special <I>Rapporteur</I>, who, in the period 2000-2005, has also undertaken    country visits to Canada, Ecuador, Philippines, border Mexico/United States,    Mexico, Spain, Morocco, Iran, Italy, Peru and Burkina Faso. </font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In 2005, the then U.N.

It urged States to put    an end to arbitrary arrests and deprivation of liberty of migrants (par. 15),    to prevent the violation of the human rights of migrants while in transit (par.    18), and to combat and prosecute international trafficking and smuggling of    migrants (endangering their lives and entailing "different forms of servitude    or exploitation" &#150; par. 19)<a name="tx94"></a><a href="#nt94"><sup>94</sup></a>.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>VII. Social Justice and the Prevention of    Forced Migrations: The Legacy of United Nations World Conferences</b></font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">A trend of contemporary European legal writing    has invoked the doctrine of the international responsibility of the State in    order to declare the State practice generating refugees &#150; and displace persons    &#150; as constituting a internationally wrongful act (mainly in the presence of    the element of <I>culpa lata</I>)<a name="tx98"></a><a href="#nt98"><sup>98</sup></a>.    The conceptual basis for this doctrinal construction can be found in the work    of the U.N. International Law Commission on the theme of State responsibility<a name="tx99"></a><a href="#nt99"><sup>99</sup></a>.    A justification for this doctrinal elaboration lies in the fact that the international    intruments of protection of refugees have limited the provision of obligations    only on the part of receiving States, but not in relation to States of origin,    of refugees; as from this finding, a customary norm of Humanitarian Law prohibiting    the generation of fluxes of refugees is invoked<a name="tx100"></a><a href="#nt100"><sup>100</sup></a>.    Therefrom the consequences are established of the internationally wrongful act    of generating fluxes of refugees &#150; which would apply <I>a fortiori</I> to sudden    migratory fluxes, &#150; also for the effects of reparations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Such doctrinal endeavours disclose, in my view,    both positive and negative aspects. On the one hand, the enlarge the horizon    for the examination of the matter, comprising at a time both the receiving State    as well as that of origin, and seeking protection of human rights in both. On    the other hand, they move on to the ambit of reparations with a private law    approach, attempting to justify sanctions to States that are not the only responsible    for forced migratory fluxes. In a "globalized" world such as that of our days,    full of profound iniquities among and within States, how to identify the origin    of so much socio-economic cruelty, how to draw the dividing line, how to single    out States (precisely the poorer) responsible for forced migrations, so as to    justify sanctions or reprisals? </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> This, in my understanding, does not appear to    be the path to follow. The problem of forced population fluxes ought to be treated    as a truly <I>global</I> issue, concerning the international community as a    whole. It cannot be properly approached from an outdated and strict bilateral    outlook (focusing only on the receiving State and the State of origin) or a    merely inter-State perspective. Being a <I>global issue</I>, it brings to the    fore the obligations <I>erga omnes</I> of protection of the victimized migrants.    The conceptual development of such obligations &#150; and of the juridical consequences    of their breach &#150; remains a high priority of contemporary legal science.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Is has been argued that, in face of the contemporary    phenomenon of forced migrations, the responsibility of individual States cannot    be dissociated from the (subsidiary) responsibility of the international community    of States as a whole<a name="tx101"></a><a href="#nt101"><sup>101</sup></a>.    As the causes of such forced migrations may, in certain circumstances, amount    to gross and massive violations of human rights, a reassessment of the conceptual    basis of refuge may lead to a needed and gradual configuration of the right    to survival of the affected or endangered segments of the population<a name="tx102"></a><a href="#nt102"><sup>102</sup></a>.    More than survival only, what is here at issue is the <I>right to live</I> with    dignity<a name="tx103"></a><a href="#nt103"><sup>103</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">The whole issue brings to the fore the imperatives    of social justice, at universal level. And a special emphasis ought to fall    upon the prevention of forced migrations. In this connection, at United Nations    level, the system of <I>early warning</I> may be recalled: it was born out of    a proposal, in the early eighties, by the Special <I>Rapporteur</I> on the question    of human rights mass exoduses. Subsequently the theme was related to that of    internally displaced persons<a name="tx104"></a><a href="#nt104"><sup>104</sup></a>.    In 1997, the U.N. High-Commissioner for Human Rights observed that, in the context    of mass exoduses and human rights,</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"the term "prevention" is not to be interpreted      in the sence of impeding that persons abandon a zone or a country but rather      in the sense of impeding that the situation of human rights deteriorates itself      to such a point that the abandonment is the only option and also of impeding      (...) the deliberate adoption of measures to displace by force great numbers      of persons, such as mass expulsions en mass, internal displacements and house      eviction, forced resettlement or repatriation"<a name="tx105"></a><a href="#nt105"><sup>105</sup></a>.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Furthermore, the final documents of the recent    cycle of World Conferences of the United Nations of the nineties contain additional    elements which allow us to approach adequately the issue of population fluxes    as a truly global issue, situated in the conceptual universe of human rights<a name="tx106"></a><a href="#nt106"><sup>106</sup></a>.    Thus, e.g., the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by    the II World Conference of Human Rights, urged all States to guarantee the protection    of human rights of all migrant workers and members of their families (part II,    par. 33). The final document of the Vienna Conference further asserted the importance    to create conditions that promote greater harmony and tolerance among migrant    workers and the rest of the society of the receiving State (par. 34). At last,    it urged States to ratify as soon as possible the International Convention on    the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families    (par. 35).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The International Conference on Population and    Development (Cairo, 1994) approached of course the matter at issue, having called    for a global approach to the migratory phenomenon at world level (chapter X    of the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action). The Cairo Conference examined the causes    of migrations, and urged the adoption of provisions relating to documented and    undocumented migrant workers<a name="tx107"></a><a href="#nt107"><sup>107</sup></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>

The 1995 Beijing    Platform of Action, adopted by the Conference, called upon States to recognize    the vulnerability in face of violence and other forms of ill treatment of migrant    women, including women migrant workers (chapter IV.D)<a name="tx110"></a><a href="#nt110"><sup>110</sup></a>.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On its turn, the II World Conference on Human    Settlements (Habitat-II, Istambul, 1996) pointed out the relevant role of human    settlements in the realization of human rights, in particular, <I>inter alia</I>,    the human right to adequate housing and the right to development. In this respect,    the 1996 Habitat-II Programme formulated recomendations pertaining to "the legal    security of tenancy, the prevention of expulsions, the fostering of refuge centres    and of support rendered to basic services and to the units education and health    in favour of displaced persons, among other vulnerable groups"<a name="tx111"></a><a href="#nt111"><sup>111</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last but not least, the U.N. World Conference    against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance (Dunbar,    2001) also devoted special attention to migrant workers, in particular to the    discrimination they suffer. The 2001 Declaration and Programme of Action adopted    by the Dunbar Conference urged States to fight against manifestations of generalized    marginalization of migrants, of xenophobia and racist prejudices, thus abiding    by their obligations pursuant to international instruments of human rights,    irrespective of the situation in which migrants find themselves (pars. 24 and    26). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Recently, the aforementioned resolution 2005/47    (of 04.19.2005) of the former U.N.

The recommendation    devotes a whole section (IV) to "access to citizenship" (pars. 13-17), and further    addresses the issues of prevention and redress of problems faced by "non-citizen    workers" (par. 34), as well as of ensuring "the access of victims to effective    legal remedies" and their "right to seek just and adequate reparation" for the    wrongs suffered (par. 18). </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>VIII. Final Reflections on the Matter</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a true global issue, the phenomenon of forced    migrations requires greater concertation at universal level to secure the prevalence    of the rights of migrants and their families. A relevant role is reserved to    public policies, as well as to mobilization of entities of the civil society    to mitigate their sufferings and improve their conditions of day-today life.    Such entities can, at first, help the organs of assistance and protection in    the identification itself of the distinct characteristics assumed by the migratory    phenomenon in different countries<a name="tx114"></a><a href="#nt114"><sup>114</sup></a>.    Secondly, they can denounce situations of flagrant violations of the human rights    of migrants<a name="tx115"></a><a href="#nt115"><sup>115</sup></a>. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thirdly, they can assist in emergency action.    Fourthly, they can help to foster the institutional strengthening to face the    migratory phenomenon, and to empower the persons affected<a name="tx116"></a><a href="#nt116"><sup>116</sup></a>.    And fifthly, by means of the education in human rights, they can help to erradicate    xenophobia and other existing prejudices in national societies. Advances in    this domain will be achieved, as already pointed out, in an atmosphere of human    solidarity. Under this perspective, recent "constructions" of the type of "irregular"    &#150; or, worse still, "illegal" &#150; migrants are quite negative<a name="tx117"></a><a href="#nt117"><sup>117</sup></a>,    and do not assist at all in seeking durable solutions to the problems faced    by migrants worldwide. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Human beings are not deprived of the rights inherent    to them as such, as a result of their migratory status or any other circumstance;    one can envisage the human rights of the uprooted, and, &#150; contrary to what some    would appear to try to make one believe nowadays, &#150; the principle of non-refoulement    belongs to the domain of <I>jus cogens</I><a name="tx118"></a><a href="#nt118"><sup>118</sup></a>.    The discretionality of States has its limits, and their policies on deportation    and expulsion ought to abide by the imperative norms of international law. </font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">On the positive side, there is nowadays a greater    <I>consciousness</I> of the pressing needs of protection of migrants worldwide.    The United Nations World Conferences along the nineties and in the passage of    the century have contributed decisively to create this new awareness. They have    placed due emphasis on the needs of protection of persons and segments of the    population in situations of <I>vulnerability</I>. Nowadays, seminars and meetings    of non-governmental and governmental experts are convened more and more often,    in the search for solutions bearing in mind the imperatives of protection of    migrants<a name="tx119"></a><a href="#nt119"><sup>119</sup></a>. Yet, greater    concertation at universal level is much needed, as the protection of migrants,    in increasing numbers from distinct parts of the world, has become a <I>legitimate    concern of the international community as a whole</I>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is reassuring that the 2000 United Nations    Millenium Declaration was attentive enought to include (par. 25) a call:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"to take measures to ensure respect for and      protection of the human rights of migrants, migrant workers and their families,      to eliminate the increasing acts of racism and xenophobia in many societies      and to promote greater harmony and tolerance in all societies".</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Half a decade later, in September 2005, the U.N.    document 2005 World Summit Outcome, also in a reassuring way, enlarged the express    reference to the issue of migrations (pars. 61-63), relating migration to development    (par. 61), and reaffirming "our resolve to take measures to ensure respect for    and protection of the human rights of migrants, migrant workers and members    of their families" (par. 62).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Advances in this domain, however, will only be    achieved amidst a radical change of mentality, and a greater consciousness of    the pressing needs to protect the basic rights of migrants. In any scale of    values, considerations of a humanitarian order ought to prevail over those of    an economic or financial order, over the alleged "protectionism" of the "work    market", over group rivalries. There is, definitively, a pressing need to situate    the human beings in the place that corresponds to him, certainly above capitals,    goods and services. This is one of the major challenges of the "globalized"    world wherein we live, from the perspective of human rights.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">May I conclude this article by reasserting what    I have sustained, two years ago, in my <I>General Course on Public International    Law</I>, delivered at the Hague Academy of International Law, to the effect    that, in my understanding, advances in Law are ultimately due to <I>human conscience</I>,    the ultimate <I>material</I> source of all Law<a name="tx120"></a><a href="#nt120"><sup>120</sup></a>.    It took many centuries for human beings to become aware of the problem of time,    for them to acquire a "historical conscience"<a name="tx121"></a><a href="#nt121"><sup>121</sup></a>.    And, since the heroic imes of <I>The Iliad</I> of Homer in ancient Greece, it    took a few more centuries for human beings to acquire an "ethical conscience",    that is, to realize that they were responsible for their own conduct (each one    being the inner "judge" of his own conduct) and for the way they treated others,    their fellow human beings.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">In this connection, in the XXVIII Immanuel Kant    used to conceptualize "conscience" as the "internal tribunal" of each person    as a "moral being"<a name="tx122"></a><a href="#nt122"><sup>122</sup></a>. Centuries    earlier, the emergence of human conscience helped to face with some reason the    so-called "struggle for existence"<a name="tx123"></a><a href="#nt123"><sup>123</sup></a>,    the old struggle for survival. The <I>recta ratio</I> present in the writings    of the so-called "founding fathers" of the Law of Nations in the XVI and XVII    centuries (such as F. de Vitoria, F. Su&aacute;rez, H. Grotius, among others),    in envisaging the <I>civitas maxima gentium</I>, in supporting the <I>jus communications</I>    worldwide, and in propounding the essential <I>unity of the humankind</I>, &#150;    such <I>recta ratio</I> of scholastic thinking and writing, had its roots going    back to the ancient Greeks (Plato and Aristotle), corresponding to their <I>orthos    logos<a name="tx124"></a></I><a href="#nt124"><sup>124</sup></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>

This article aims at demonstrating the possibility of criticism about the criminal law (Lei 9.099/95) from two perspectives seen as marginal within penal law studies: the legal feminism and the penal criticism (garantismo). Taking into account the victim's condition and the defendant's rights during the criminal proceedings, such discourses are linked to show the inefficacy of that law towards both the victim and the defendant.

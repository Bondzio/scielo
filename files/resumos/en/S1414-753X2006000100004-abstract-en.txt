This paper focuses on the contemporary debate between epistemological conditions of knowledge and social and cultural understanding of these conditions, considering the mutual influences given by the historical context in which both occur. First of all, the traditional view of science is supported by the disciplinary system that reinforces the fragmented conception about social and natural things or ideas; on the other hand, we observe a strong opposition against that former standpoint from supporters of a new philosophical, political and epistemological vision about social and environmental issues, attached to a thought of complexity.

The present research examines the environmental matter in the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) of the Delta of the Parna√≠ba River, focusing on the ambient licensing value. Technical visits to all companies installed in the area until the first semester of 2004 and non-structured interviews were carried out; the existing legislation was raised; and the environmental studies and reports of technical inspections performed by IBAMA were evaluated. The conclusion was that the adjustment made by IBAMA in the ambient licensing process of what is an Area of Permanent Preservation (APP) in the mangrove is the critical point to the carciniculture activity.

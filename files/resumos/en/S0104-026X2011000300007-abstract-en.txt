Child culture is increasingly more permeated by a gendered quotidian, i.e., most of the cultural processes and products portray content where the gender issue is insistently treated in a binary form and, consequently, excluding. The purpose of this paper, therefore, was to study Marcelo Romagnoli's children's theater and the Children's Band (Banda Mirim), whose plays are designed to take apart and question the stereotypes that dichotomize boys´ and girls´ lives. Watching the staging of Felizardo and O menino Teresa and analyzing the context of the texts, it was found that the characters propose a model for boys and girls that goes against the standard and official culture, encouraging new gender social relations among children, contributing, therefore, to the achievement of the "goals of the millennium" as proposed by the UN and adopted by Brazil, especially as equality between the sexes is regarded.

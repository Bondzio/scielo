Abstract The study of the thought of the French Dominican priest Louis-Joseph Lebret seeks to reflect on the developmentalists strategies formulated in Brazil during 1950 and 1960. It highlights a line of Catholic thought, little studied in the history of developmentalist thinking in the country. The focus on the trajectory and praxis of Lebret, involving the reception of his thought by the Catholic left and the first generations of urban planners, throws light on the historic importance and validity of the cleric thought up to present times. In this sense, there is the report on the industrialization of Pernambuco. This report was the first effort of regional development policy planning, it was considered the inaugural landmark of the Industrial and Port Complex of Suape, one of the largest centers of industrial investment ever made in the region.

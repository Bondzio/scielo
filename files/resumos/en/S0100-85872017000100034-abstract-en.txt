Abstract We intend to show the complexity of &#8220;prostitution&#8221;, as a social phenomenon, specifically in its relations with religion, in two contexts: in the historical institution of sacred prostitution and in the case of prostitutes converted to Pentecostalism nowadays. The intention is to understand how &#8220;prostitution&#8221; and the figure of the &#8220;prostitute&#8221; accumulate distinct, distant and even paradoxical layers of meaning. In this way, its rich constitution will not be well translated if you conceive this phenomenon in a flat or simplified form, like a morally condemned activity/identity. Religions, as moral matrices, guide constructions of meaning regarding prostitution that extrapolate this understanding of moral condemnation. Based on sources of different natures (historical, theological, ethnographic), I indicate ways in which this religious appropriation of the theme takes place.

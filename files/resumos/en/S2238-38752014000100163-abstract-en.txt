Abstract This paper discusses an aspect that is not always regarded in art - the sale -, pondering on the ways whereby it is linked to creation processes and to several atributes that usually add to artists' identity, such as originality , which is individualised and not interested in commercialising with products. By analysing a situation in which plastic artists work at a handicrafts market in Fortaleza, state of Cear√° - Brazil, we discover that the similarities and differences between, on the one hand, the artist/art categories and the craftworker/handicraft ones, on the other, play a role when pondering on the variable meaning of procedures associated to selling products, the conditions in which it is done and how much it leads to distinguishing plastic artists, not only from other artists but also among them.

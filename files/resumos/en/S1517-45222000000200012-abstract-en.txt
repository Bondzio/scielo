This work falls within the studies of gender, growing and dynamics of the informal sector an the increase or decrease of the propensity to work in informal conditions, whether it happens because of the nature of the contract (precariousness); for lack of payment (usually called "en gris" o "en negro" - "grey" or "black" - because of its undocumented (illegal) nature, or because it takes place in informal economic units. In the Argentinean economic context of the 90s, with the new measures building a new profile of the work market, the determinants of that work market without contributions are examined, using data from a table of propensity to informal labor, based on a method of analysis of non-observables applied to multiple-cause and multiple-consequence phenomena. The map regarding the whole country, in a previous investigation is the basis to a deeper exam of the Argentinean northwestern area, one of the countrys most underprivileged and one where the rise in informal labor is higher, in contrast with the whole country.

This article deals with the production of specialized knowledge about the female body between the 19th and 20th centuries. Its main goal is to analyze the production of images displayed in obstetrics treatises and manuals published in Europe and used by Brazilian medical students and doctors. It seeks to understand the realism of the medical-scientific images of the female body as a means of expression of a new relationship between doctors and women, resulting from the investigation methods used in anatomy-pathology laboratories and in the clinical examination of pregnant women.

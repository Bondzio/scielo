The analysis of secondary data is one of the "oldest" strategies that sociologists have used to work with the phenomena of social reality when the available information was prepared by others. This study intends to establish a systematic reflection on the use of secondary information in the processes of qualitative social research. The article is divided into four parts: the first works on a definition of data and secondary analysis; the second part discusses advantages and disadvantages of the use of qualitative information; the third asks how, why and what for is the reuse of qualitative information; and finally the fourth part presents some proposals for discussion. The aim is to establish clear criteria that would facilitate the use and analysis of information produced by others and/or in different contexts of production.

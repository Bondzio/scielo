Feminine writing is one of the strategies used to confront the patriarchal mechanisms that have been set up by occidental logic. In light of this proposal, various voices of the other have risen. In a transdisciplinary exercise, feminine writing has taken this in, so as to promote its lines of expression and enrich its discussions and debates. This is the case of the crossroads between culture and bisexual writing and some of their representations in contemporary theatre. The cultural and postcolonial contexts that nourish the relations between gender and culture stimulate the theatrical creators and motivate them to display that dialogic exchange in their pieces of work. Thus, the objective of this work is to observe how these crosses are brought to the theatrical text - as feminine writing - by the British contemporary playwright Caryl Churchill.

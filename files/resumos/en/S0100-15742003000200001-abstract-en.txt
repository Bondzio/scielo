Development and the official character of international assessments surveys and national standards of school performance favour the coexistence of a double institutional definition of success at school. The usual ones take into account the curriculum effectively taught, adapt itself to the levels of the pupils and present a rather doubtful reliability. The second one is more objective, but gives a too great weight to what can be measured through standardised tests: the cognitive more than the socio-emotional, the capacities and the knowledge more than the competencies and the relationship to knowledge. Both assessment and ordinary school evaluations are now in conflict. Necessary regulations could move them closer to the ideal, if they employed in order to consider the success at school, all the components of the formal curriculum and them only.

From a historical-critical perspective, this article deals with the trajectory of the basic cycle in São Paulo State school system from the moment of its creation till the 1990s. It also discusses the actions and reactions brought about by the proposal and by the curricular reorganization of the middle school resulting from this initiative. The documental study starts from the motivations that guided the education policy at a moment of political opening, when the first elected government took office in the State of São Paulo, after the long period of military regime. The varied reactions from education professionals and from civil society, most of which were against the measures set forth, are then analyzed. What are the reasons that have systematically led to the failure of proposals committed to ensure regular education for people on the lowest incomes? The discussion highlights the strong presence of a conservative thought that permeates pedagogical culture in Brazil, that is against proposals that, similar to the one of basic cycle, are committed to the democratization of education.

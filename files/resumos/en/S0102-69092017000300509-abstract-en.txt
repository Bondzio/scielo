ABSTRACT Real estate market has reached during the last decades a huge transcendence in economic, political, and social levels in most of the developed economies. The objective of this paper is to study this sector having as its scope the advertisement. For this, and as part of a greater project, we will discuss the construction of a theoretical event based on a hermeneutic revision that recovers the existing and more updated necessary knowledge that is composed of the knowledge and the researches from different branches of the Social Sciences. It proposes to be a theoretical framework with an interdisciplinary approach that includes economic, social, anthropological, political, cultural, and mediatic aspects. Through the later empirical study, it will serve to delineate the discursive mechanisms of real estate advertisement in Spain during the recent peak of real estate property, whose results could serve as a reference in other geographic scopes that face similar socioeconomic situations.

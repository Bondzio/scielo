The objective of this study is to understand the experiences of deaf students who attended bilingual schools and identify with the deaf culture. The starting point was field research with three young women and two young men, between 21 and 27 years old, who were enrolled in undergraduate courses for at least three semesters. The work consisted in semi-structured individual interviews, conducted by a deaf female scholarship-holder and recorded on video, which were later translated into Portuguese and analyzed for their content. The results show how challenging it is to adapt to a world of people who for the most part have normal hearing, the difficulties of moving between sign language and Portuguese, the need to maintain identity's points of reference that are valued for those who hear normally, as well as the importance of reorganizing the teaching strategies and evaluating the involvement of the Libras [Brazilian sign language] interpreter.

In 1994, the Catholic Pope, Juan Pablo II, founded the Pontifical Academy for Life due to the new scientific developments in genetics, contraception, in vitro fertilization and abortion. The main objective of this academy was to defend and promote human life by means of studying and monitoring science and law progress. At the end of the 1990s, In Argentina, some catholic movements began training lays, especially health professionals, in bioethics so that they could spread their ideas and beliefs in the territory, where the baptized people are. This work will treat the identity production strategies of some catholic bioethics' leaders of a group whose work is to teach bioethics to lays during 2008.

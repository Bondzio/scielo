The objective of this paper is to define the notion of "Pentecostal Architecture", to reveal and understand the spatial, formal, symbolic, material and territorial elements which help to identify the qualities of the "Pentecostal" Temples in Chile. First, the articles present the material dimension of these Temples, emphasizing the biblical idea of "Temple" implicit in the doctrinal speech. And then, the paper presents milestones in the historical development of the "Pentecostal Architecture" in Chile, to understand how history and the socialeconomical insertion of the Pentecostal movement, is related with the theological conception of "Temple". Finally, upon the study of some selected buildings, an interpretation of the Pentecostal architecture is proposed.

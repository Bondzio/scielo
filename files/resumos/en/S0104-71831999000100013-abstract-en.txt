Abstract Addressing &#8220;The Future of Ethnocentrism&#8221;, this article starts from the premiss that, although globalization may have, in many cases, diminished the differences which separate peoples, the prejudice and forms of discrimination which accompany these differences have not diminished. Furthermore, cultural diversity, in this scenario, is not confined to clearly delimited ethnic and national groups but includes other factors such as gender, generation, sex and class. In such a context, the pragmatic acceptation of one&#8217;s own parochialism or even the passive tolerance of distant modes of life are attitudes which are not only intellectually dishonest but morally reprehensible. It is in the uncomfortable encounters of variant subjectivities within his own society that the anthropologist defines his role.

During the 1990s, neoliberal policies were implemented in Argentina, which increased unemployment and poverty. In this context, part of the poor population became even more impoverished and resorted to informal waste collection as a survival strategy. In this situation, public space became not only a space for circulation, but also one for reproduction of living conditions, and, since the activity is carried out in full view of all, they had to set up "fa√ßades" so that to get recognition from others. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze the interactions between these individuals and other actors, and how these waste pickers use public space in the city of Mar del Plata, an intermediate seaside city in Argentina. The research was conducted drawing on in-depth interview and observation, and also on City newspapers. The major findings concern the techniques they use to gain self-esteem and recognition from others.

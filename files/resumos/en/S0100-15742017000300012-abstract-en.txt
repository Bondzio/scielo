ABSTRACT The aim of this article is to understand how cultural diversity and the new communication ecosystem emerging from digital cultures are represented within the discourses that frame Information and Communication Technology - ICT - policies in education, in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. It is a qualitative study that employed discourse analysis procedures to understand the results and social cartography as a way of representing the intertextual field. Discursive perspectives are mapped based on the relationship between cultural diversity and digital culture. The article emphasizes the need for cultural relevance in ICT education initiatives, as well as for recognizing digital culture as a component of cultural diversity in the design of educational policies.

Abstract This article compares the reception of Pierre Bourdieu's with that of Alain Touraine's within the Brazilian social sciences. At the time when Brazilian social scientist became acquainted with Bourdieu's work, Touraine's ideas already belonged to the international circulation of ideas and scholars between France and Brazil. The trajectory of both French sociologists in regard with the field of Brazilian social sciences is an interesting lead for understanding the position of this same field within the international circulation of ideas and scholars. The sociologists of the University of SÃ£o Paulo invited Touraine, with his intellectual background in industrial sociology, at the time when studies about the industry in the metropolis were flourishing. By contrast Bourdieu's work was appropriated by subsequent generations of scholars. When Bourdieu acquired fame in Anglo-American countries in the nineties he was already well known by Brazilian specialists. Some of his research tools were appropriated by within these new generations of the social sciences' field.

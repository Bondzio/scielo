This article discusses work process rationalization in civil construction, particularly in the subsector of buildings, as well as its difficulties, taking into account the sector's heterogeneity and specificities. A field study conducted in a construction site sought to present its day-to-day reality, as well as the changes in course, particularly from the point of view of its workers. In order to understand the ordinary, tacit forms of working and the day-to-day relations involving the work environment, as well as the possible impacts of these transformations on workers, we chose to conduct an ethnographic survey. It is worth stressing that, besides technical characteristics, such as the successiveness of constructive stages, which strongly induces labor turnover, work management we also analyzed management strategies, which include reducing labor and pension scheme expenses. We also found that, besides informality in work agreements, subcontracting and traditional work and labor management forms stand out.

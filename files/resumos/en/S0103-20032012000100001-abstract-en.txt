This article assesses the new mechanisms of regulation on rural sector implemented in Brazil during the last decade. Based on the approach of Economic Sociology and the New Institutional Economics, it was analyzed the different phases which the agro-industrial complexes went through. It was possible to prove that we are seeing a new period regarding the organization of rural sector, as the example of sugarcane and orange juice complexes showed. In the sugarcane case, the Consecana system has been successful, except for some situational disruption of some farmers. In the same way, the Consecana has allowed the whole sector to advance on further subjects, such as the spreading of a new agricultural and industrial pattern, the rural workers remuneration and the sugarcane land prices. As for the citrus case, the proposal system named Consecitrus is now under discussion, but due to the low legitimate of representation and the historical disputes, there would be much more difficulties to its implementation.

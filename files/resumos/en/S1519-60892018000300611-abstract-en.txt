Abstract: This paper aims to discuss Axel Honneth's book, The idea of socialism, published in 2015, considering John Dewey's Liberalism and social action (1935) and Democracy and education (1916). It will be examined a possible approximation between Honneth's socialism and Dewey's defense of a renascent liberalism. It will be suggested that Honneth's proposal is problematic due to an insufficient appropriation of Dewey's ideas, particularly those related to the role of education within the democratic will formation, upon which social cooperation rests.

This paper analyzes the main welfare policies developed by the leftist government in Uruguay, in the first two years of its term, trying to identify the areas and sectors that were prioritized, the predominant orientation and the role that the State plays in the provision of the social protection. The preliminary results indicate the configuration of a moderate statism in general regarding public policies and, in particular, in the social field. However, the persistence of a group of strategic social services is verified, such as the system of social security, that continue in a semiprivatization regime, such as was established in previous governments. This coexistence of different options, in the social field, opens a group of political issues on the system of emerging social politics.

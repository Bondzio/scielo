Abstract This essay analyzes images and representations of Eva Perón combining theories of corporeality and affection with theories of the photo-image proposed by WJT Mitchell, Roland Barthes and Susan Sontag. It aims to revise the myths related to Eva Perón and her physical and emotional representations, from the perspective of an analysis of her corporeality and her relation with the pre-peronist imagery around women, politics, beauty and consumerism.

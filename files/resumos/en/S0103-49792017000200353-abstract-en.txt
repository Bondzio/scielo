This article presents a discussion about the identity resignifications that occurred in a remaining Quilombo community called Kalunga, located in northeast of the state of Goi√°s, Brazil, ranging from its formation and from the recognition of these communities by the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988. The recognition adds new identity problems that appear in the way in which the group experiences and organizes the territory. Considering an ethnographic study, I try to demonstrate that the ethnicity of the group is based on its own social and territorial organization, and that it is not possible to identify an object of limited contours &#8211; neither color, &#8220;race&#8221; or African culture, nor Quilombo origin &#8211; in which the individuals face each other and from which they inaugurate their identity.

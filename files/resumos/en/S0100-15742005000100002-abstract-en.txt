Based on concepts of citizenship and human rights, this article aims to show how inclusive education policies, notwithstanding the progressive legislation, are limited by the lack of an effective elementary education policy. The three stages of elementary education do not form a universal path, since kindergarten and high school are not universal. Besides, the presence of Brazil on the international scene, associated with its historical uneven distribution of wealth, stimulate targeted compensatory policies rather than public policies that would ensure equal opportunities. The traditional efforts made by educators and intellectuals are not enough, only a vigorous social movement can assure the effectiveness of these rights.

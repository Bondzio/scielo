This paper aims to analyze the relationship between events of violence against boys from eight to fifteen years in Altamira, Par√°, and the subsequent actions organized by their families. Narrating their trajectories of mobilization, the victims' relatives create their "fight" as a "thorny path", punctuated by disappointments. However, this is just painful walk that provokes the feeling of closeness with their sons and brothers. The mobilization appears as a resource found to "do something" for their children, thus preventing the crimes could be repeated and so that the victims were never forgotten. The analysis will focus on the dimension of speech in its curative potential, but is also capable of reviving, in the bodies and feelings of mothers, sister and fathers of victims, sufferings and pains described as the worst of their lives.

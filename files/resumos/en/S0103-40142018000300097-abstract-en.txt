ABSTRACT The Historical-Investigative approach (HI) has been built over the last two decades in the context of the search for strategies to encourage students&#8217; motivation, engagement, and argumentation in the classroom. HI provides relevant scientific skills, makes students more active and participatory in the learning process, and contextualizes school knowledge. This approach is characterized by the use of investigative experimental activities, guided by cases from the history of Science. The activities are student-centered and teacher-oriented, and aim to create teaching and learning situations that foster reflection on specific scientific and meta-scientific contents, experimental practice, and argumentation. This paper discusses the pedagogical and epistemological foundations, objectives and contributions of the historical-investigative approach to Science teaching.

This study aims at to identify the values found in school and to verify which interactions favor the construction and/or maintenance of moral values, especially self-respect. Departing from the theoretical approach of sociohistorical Psychology, the investigation is based on the studies on morality conducted by Jean Piaget and Yves de la Taille, and has come to the conclusion that interactions promoting and not promoting the construction of moral values coexist in school, the second being the most frequent.

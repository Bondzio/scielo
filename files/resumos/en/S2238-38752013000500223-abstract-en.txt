Abstract This article aims to examine the recent situation of labor union affiliation in Brazil in order to explain the lack of dynamism of unionization in the 2000's, despite the tendency of declining unemployment and increasing occupation in the formal labor market. Regarding the causes of stability in the rates of unionization over the past decade, the article's main analytical foci are the strong segmentation of the labor market and socioeconomic inequality, especially concerning the incomplete process of employment, the heterogeneity of the condition of job placement and the partial regulation of labor relations. Based on a national data survey, this paper discusses the perspectives for union representation in the near future.

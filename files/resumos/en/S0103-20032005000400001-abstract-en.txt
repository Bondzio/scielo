Farmers' relative efficiency evaluation can be useful to aid decision-making in agriculture. The use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in this context allows the identification of inefficiencies sources and benchmark units. This paper used DEA to measure the efficiency of farmers' sample from Holambra, a SÃ£o Paulo State municipality. Cultivated area, employment and machinery usage are the inputs and net income is the output. DEA BCC is used in two models: global and by groups.

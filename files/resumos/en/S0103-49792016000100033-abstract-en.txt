Brazil actively participates in the international cooperation and development in many different areas, but with special emphasis on agriculture and food. Brazil is an international reference in these areas due to the relative success of internal assistance programs (Bolsa Fam√≠lia, Fome Zero, etc.) and to the possibility of transferring these experiences to other countries. On the other hand, it is a key sector for Brazilian companies, for which agribusiness is one of the bases for their accumulation of capital. Food is, then, at the same time, a basic right that must be secured and protected and a commodity that can be exchanged at high profits in the commodities market. The tensions created around these two views are the reason for this article, which analyzed the practices of the South-South Cooperation with African countries in the field of food with an approach towards the coherence of policies with development.

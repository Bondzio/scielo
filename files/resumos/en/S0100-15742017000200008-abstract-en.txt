ABSTRACT This article aims to present the results of an investigation into the Programa do Livro Did√°tico para o Ensino Fundamental1 do Instituto Nacional do Livro - Plidef/INL. It was a co-edition system between the public and private sectors from 1971 to 1976. Based on the field concept of the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, we sought to define what the historical and social conditions were which allowed the existence of the Plidef/INL field. Data were collected from documents of the executive and legislative branches, as well as reports from national journals. The results indicate sometimes troubling relations between the Plidef/INL field and the political, literary and educational spheres of influence.

Based on the Industrial Economics theory, this study aimed to analyze the soybean processing industry structure, corporate conduct and performance in Brazil. Considering the relevant market of soybean processing industry, it was analyzed the concentration index of soybean processors with sales and strategies determinants of the plants location of major companies that process soybean (Bunge, Cargill, ADM and Louis Dreyfus), analyzing changes from 1990 to 2010. To analyze the sector performance in Brazil, matrix correlation and multiple regression method of weighted least squares statistical analyses were used. Overall, in Brazil, there is still an increase trend in the number of soybeans processing plants. However, in 2010, the number of non-operating plants was higher, showing that not all processors are fully using resources. It was found that the concentration of soybean processors is not limiting the performance of the sector, but the costs have not been fully transferred by soybean producers to prices.

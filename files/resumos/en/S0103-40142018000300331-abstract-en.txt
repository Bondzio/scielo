ABSTRACT The teaching of Science was incorporated into school curricula only in the nineteenth century. In Imperial Brazil, the teaching of the natural sciences was incipient, although, since the creation of the Col√©gio Pedro II in 1837, Science was already part of the curriculum of secondary education. But only in the second half of the last century the earliest courses in Geosciences (Geology, Geophysics, Meteorology, and Oceanography) began to be created. Currently, there are courses in these modalities across the country. However, there are serious obstacles for teaching to evolve in keeping with the current needs of the professional market and the trends imposed by technological advances. In this work, we analyze obstacles and professional gaps in Higher Education, and highlight some educational practices capable of improving learning and which could be universalized. It is no longer possible to put off the expansion of the area of Geosciences in teacher training and qualification courses for Basic Education. This article brings together some essential factors to achieve this goal.

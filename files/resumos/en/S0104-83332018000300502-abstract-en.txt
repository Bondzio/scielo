Abstract This article is part of a broader study about the labor circulations of international migrant women in the Argentine care sector. Specifically, it focuses on the analysis of the trajectories of two women who work as nurses. In-depth interviews are used to understand the labor trajectories and their relationship with migratory projects, the ties with the work of care (paid and unpaid) and the representations of the women about their career.

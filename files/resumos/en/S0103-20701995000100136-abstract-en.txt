Based on an interview given by Foucault where he acknowledges the work of Heidegger and Nietzsche as the two main pillars of his own thought, the essay explores one way of approximating Heidegger and Foucault: the understanding of ethics as dwelling and inhabitation. The renewal of thought on ethics which takes place in the latest works by Foucault, through a sharp separation between ethics and moral philosophy and through an analysis of ethics as procedures and techniques of subjectivation - as technologies of self - are being here analysed from the point of view of ethics as dwelling and inhabitation. Finally, Foucault's last message, his proposition of ethics understood as an new esthetic of existence is here recuperated and discussed.

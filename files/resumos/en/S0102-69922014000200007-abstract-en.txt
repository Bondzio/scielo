Contrary to evocations about the demise of the feminist movement, it is possible to identify its constant presence in Brazilian society, characterized by a wide range of political identities, different degrees of institutionalization and various ways of expression. The aim of this paper is to explore, based on the analysis of the Brazilian Slutwalk, the contrasts and continuities between different generations of Feminists, especially in relation to how the issue of diversity and inclusion of gender, race, sexuality and generations has been treated.

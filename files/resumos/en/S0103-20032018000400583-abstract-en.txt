Abstract: This study analyzes the determinants of cashew nuts exports from Guinea-Bissau to India (1986-2011), by using the Bergstrand&#8217;s (1985)gravity model. The reported results of the panel data model (OLS-pooled) suggest, on the one hand, that the flow of cashew nuts exports is negatively related to the transport cost and, on the other hand, positively related to the exchange rate and gross incomes and per capita incomes, which is consistent with the theoretical assumptions of gravity models and the seminal studies of the economic literature with application of these models.

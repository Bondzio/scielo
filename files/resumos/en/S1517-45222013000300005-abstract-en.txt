We propose a transdiciplinary dialogue between the sociological analysis of representations and the critical interpretation of aesthetic practices (literature and video) in order to bring up a singular gaze on social violence. In particular, we take note of various contemporary aesthetic practices involving the theme of Spanish Political Transition (1973-1985), which build quite contrasting discourses. The current discourses on the Transition tend toward two extremely opposed positions: a critical view and a celebratory view. In the light of this, we comment in detail some recent works that present a critical perspective of the Transition. We take, in particular, two recent crime fiction novels that set their action in the years of the Transition, and also two contemporary video essays that challenge the celebratory view, the hegemonic discourse on the political transition. Finally, we evaluate the relevance of such kind of transdisciplinary approach for inquiring on the open debates involving the practice of violence.

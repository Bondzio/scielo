Abstract The paper examines a new painting movement led by indigenous artists born and schooled in the Amazon who migrated to Lima, the Capital of Peru, where their works of art obtained outstanding recognition. The study focuses upon two eminent painters of this scene, Rold√°n Pinedo and Enrique Casanto, analysing the connections between their paintings and their socio-cosmological surroundings. The text highlights the political scope of their visual proposals and argues that Amazonian artists introduce new modes of conceiving images and their relationships with plants, defying the perception of the forest and indigenous peoples imposed by the city.

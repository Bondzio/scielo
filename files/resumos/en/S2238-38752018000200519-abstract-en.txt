Abstract This paper analyises some results deriving from research on trajectories of northeastern men and women migrants who came to the state of SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil) between the 1960s and 1970s. During interviews we found there to be a significant difference in the speech of men and women in the way that life histories were brought to light. Men usually recite their life histories taking job experiences as reference points, whereas women tell stories about events related to the private sphere. This difference is apprehended here not only as a matter of gender identities, but also with reference to the meanings attributed to the family.

This study uses data from 21 fourth grade parents in 8 Brazilian state pre- and primary schools in Belo Horizonte - MG, Brazil, to examine their views about parental involvement and others issues related to their children's school education. The data has been collected through using Epstein's typology (in Brandt, 1989). This typology has already been validated in the past and it was created to summarise many of the kinds of parental involvement practices that any level of school education - from nursery years to secondary level - may develop. A different pattern of the parents and the schools relationship emerged from the parents' data analysis if put in contrast with Epstein's parental involvement typology (1987). The pattern can be unfolded in three variations described as help, involvement and communication. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to conduct the interview with the parents. This article does not intend to analyse the present situation of the contemporary family but we acknowledge the fact that there are different family structures in our modern world and that they may influence parental involvement results.

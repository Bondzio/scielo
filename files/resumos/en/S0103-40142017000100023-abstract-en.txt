Abstract The current Brazilian recession is worrisome, but even more so is the country's very slow economic growth over the last 35 years. The causes are multiple, but a frequently ignored one is emphasized here, namely, Brazil's extremely feeble participation in world trade. This paper proposes a program to integrate the country into the international productive chains, based on three pillars: reduction of the so-called Brazil-cost, substitution of competitive exchange rates for import tariffs, and trade deals.

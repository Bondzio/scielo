This paper aims to do a comparison between workers of the clothes and accessories making sector in two different cities: the capital from São Paulo and small Toritama, located in Pernambuco hinterland. Only the immigrants from Ceará that work in that sector were considered in the city of São Paulo, which number was close to that of the total of employed people in the same activity in Toritama. Microdata of the Census of 2000 were used. In general, informality was expressive in both contexts, although a little higher in Toritama. This paper shows that most of the workers in cholthes making, in the two cities, were badly paid, had work days above the pattern, weren't registered, and few contributed to Social Welfare. Considering the monetary non monetary and costs of life in the capital from São Paulo, it was not evident that the immigrants from Ceará studied were in better situation than the workers of Toritama.

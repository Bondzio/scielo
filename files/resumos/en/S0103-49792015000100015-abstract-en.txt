More than half a century after the publication of Alberto Guerreiro Ramos&#8217;s &#8220;The Sociological Reduction&#8221;, it is still a milestone in social sciences, especially for sociology in Brazil. However, some things still must be made clear on the social and intellectual context in which the work was produced, as well as its critical reception in that moment. There are also some aspects to be analyzed from the current perspective, that is, a review must be made of the importance of this work in Brazilian culture and what parts are out of touch and what parts remain relevant nowadays.

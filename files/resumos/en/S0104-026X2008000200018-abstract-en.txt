This essay will analyze some of the debates around abortion in the National Congress due to the Constitutional Amendment Bill - PEC25/95, by Deputy Severino Cavalcanti (PPB/PE), where the main issue was precisely life defense. The discursive blocks that present the debate in relation to pregnancy interruption, the religious principles or biological determinism on which those debates are based, and the ways in which such discourses are maintained will be identified. Distinct understandings of life, as a result of the points used in such discourses, which are aligned with the position of the Catholic Church and the Feminist Movement - the social actors of this debate- are also discussed here.

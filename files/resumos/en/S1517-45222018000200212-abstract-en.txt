Abstract This article discusses, although not exhaustively, the components of sociological thought of Georg Simmel and Max Weber that allow to identify the performance of a tragic sensitivity in the analysis of the processes that constitute the modern culture. In the first author, we identify the &#8220;tragic point of view&#8221; as ambivalence and the assumption of a fundamental self-contradiction embedded in the processes and phenomena that constitute the modern life style. In the second author, we try to reveal how the tragedy arises, in a surprising, ironic and undesirable way, from the unpredictable and unintentional consequences of the actions of agents.

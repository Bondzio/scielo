ABSTRACT This article analyzes the class, race, and gender voting patterns that propelled Trump&#8217;s 2016 victory, highlighting his popularity among non-college-educated white voters, and especially white males, including many union members and others in labor union households. White working-class disaffection from the established political system was among the many byproducts of the neoliberal economic transformations that unfolded over the previous four decades, especially the rapid de-unionization that took off in the late 1970s. Against the background of Trump&#8217;s success in attracting white working-class support, the second half of this article analyzes the plight of the U. S. labor movement and the formidable challenges it faces in the Trump era.

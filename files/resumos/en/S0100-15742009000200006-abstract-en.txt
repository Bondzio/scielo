The objective of this article is to discuss, in light of the approval of the Official Opinion number 38/06 by the National Council of Education which made teaching Philosophy and Sociology mandatory in high school, the relevance of teaching Psychology, particularly in the state of São Paulo, where this subject has been increasingly losing space. The debate is grounded in an ethnographic survey consisting of two case studies carried out in teaching institutions, one public and the other private, in the city of São Paulo. Psychology classes were attended, and observation of issues related to teaching it were analyzed. The characteristic aspects of each school has led us to reflect about the inequalities within the São Paulo state education system, and to discuss teaching Psychology and its contribution, as a science, in this setting.

Abstract This is a brief discussion on the area of sociology of literature internationally, bringing a synthesis of the conflicts and uncertainties that mark its institutionalization, as well as the resurgent academic production of the area as of the 1990s on, to introduce and contextualize the dossier Literature and sociological knowledge. This dossier is intended to be taken as part of a set of recent works that have been trying to redefine the scope of the sociology of literature. It comprises articles focused on a specific topic: the relationship between literature and sociological knowledge, which highlights a reflection on the nature of knowledge that can be drawn from each of these forms of reconstruction of the social world.

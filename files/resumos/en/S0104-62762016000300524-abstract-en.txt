Abstract This paper analyzes the determinants of retrospective sociotropic economic evaluation in the 2014 presidential race in Brazil, based on: a) the knowledge that the voter has from objective information of the economy; b) the knowledge that the voter has from their lived experience/feeling of social mobility; c) their party affectivity; d) their ideological identity. Our contribution consists of showing that: a) having knowledge of/objective information about the economy has no impact on one&#8217;s assessment of the economy; b) knowledge through lived experience, identified here as a sense of social mobility, has no impact on one&#8217;s assessment of the economy in the expected direction&#8212;the greater the rise, the more positive the evaluation of the economy; c) party affectivity, in turn, has a strong impact on evaluations of the economy. The article uses data from CSES/Eseb &#8211; Brazilian Electoral Study.

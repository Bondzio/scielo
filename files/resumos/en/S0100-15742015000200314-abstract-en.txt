This article deals with the importance of the issue of the subject in social representations. In order to do this, it analyzes some models of social psychology and alludes to the new perspectives on the subject which were developed in the social sciences and humanities. After a brief overview of the use of the category of subject in the history of this discipline, especially its return to the social sciences in the 1990s, and the related notions such as "actor" and "agent", the need to work with the notion of "subjectivation" emerges in researches that consider subjectivity without losing the social dimension in the study of representations considered in two levels: the subjective and the trans-subjective.

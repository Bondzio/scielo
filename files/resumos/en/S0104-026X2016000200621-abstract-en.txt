Abstract: This articles aims at discussing some concerns addressed by the recent UN Report named Progress on the WorldÂ´s Women 2015-2016 - Transforming Economies, Realizing Rights. The UN Report rightly draws attention to the persistence of gender asymmetries in our contemporary world. Moreover, it examines how orthodox macroeconomic policies reinforce gender inequalities by promoting cutbacks in public spending as well as by narrowing the scope of universal policies.

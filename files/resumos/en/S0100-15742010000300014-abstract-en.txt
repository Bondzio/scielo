The article presents a new experience of participative and deliberative municipal education planning in four Chilean municipalities of the Región de los Ríos and de los Lagos. What we presented is a different practice from the centralized one, non inclusive and traditional, that insists on three scopes, generally controverted and forgotten in the local planning: the inclusion of other actors (besides the municipal ones), the joint responsibility in the proposed tasks and the shared monitoring and evaluation of the planned things; pillars for the generation of confidences, for a landed planning and for the shared conformation of a communal educational horizon. We want, basically, to emphasize that in the local decision making "many are better than few" and that these spaces harness an austere planning, but not less complex, in collaborative agreements, that can remain in the long term and generate the inclusion and shared decisions in the municipal education.

The authors recognize that the discussion about genetically modified organisms (GMOs), presented by Brazilian scientific literature as well as the media is, in general, highly biased towards approval of these products. Very few articles go deeper into questioning the effects of a possible introduction of these genetically modified organisms in Brazil, be it from a technical, social, economic, or political viewpoint. The general objective of the article was to try, based on the existing literature on the subject, to fulfill some of these omissions, considered extremely important to the evaluation process. The authors also tried to point out some of the ways of bias used by the media with respect to GMOs. The main conclusion of the study was that, although the presented arguments in favor of GMOs can be easily rejected from a technical viewpoint, the transformation of GMOs into a commercial reality depends, above all, upon a social order commanded by capital, presently represented mainly by large corporations and their allies, beginning with the State. This is the most important cause for the bias found in the media.

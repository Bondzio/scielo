Abstract: This article aims to analyze from a singular perspective the context in which Lima Barreto was admitted in hospita, in 1914. On one side, across different documents produced by the author at the time, as short stories, diaries, interviews, stories and their own entry reports into the hospital. On the other, from the comparison of records of patients admitted to the Hospital at the same year. To that end, the article explores social markers of difference - race, gender, social status, origin -showing how using and handling them helps to understand the very speeches given by internals and experts. Finally, from the interpretation of the photographs and the use of a dialogical method, as practiced by Bakhtin and Ginzburg, I seek to recover clues and traces, as well as understand the patients not only as "victims" but as "actors" in a certainly uneven situation.

Abstract The interviews of Roberto DaMatta and Yvonne Maggie enlighten the fruitful dialogue established by Brazilian anthropologists with Victor Turner's work. Rituals' prominent role in social processes and the inclusion of Western societies in anthropological research deeply influenced DaMatta's own work, which renewed Brazilian social sciences as a whole. The concept of social drama, in turn, inspired Maggie's research, which broke new grounds in the anthropology of religion and urban anthropology. The interviews tell us about a lively anthropology based not only in field research, but also in many intelectual interchanges shared with teachers and colleagues. They tell us about the insights that drove rich research processes as well as little-known but remarkable aspects of a highly innovative moment of anthropology in Brazil.

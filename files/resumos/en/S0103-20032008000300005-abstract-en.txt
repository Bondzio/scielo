The aim of this dissertation is to identify the causal relation between rural child labour and health. The analysis utilized the PNAD, a Brazilian household survey, from 1998 and 2003. The econometric modeling was based on the pseudo-panel approach and was considered the children from 5 to 15 years old in 1998 and from 10 to 20 years old in 2003. The results show that work and work in risky jobs in the agricultural sector do not differ from those impacts of other sectors. It was also presented, for all individuals that work in the agricultural sector does not impact the health capital and work in the non rural sector impact negatively the health capital. So, the government intervention in rural areas should be different from the one implemented on the urban area to mitigate the impact of child labour on health and also, the government intervention should be implemented in parallel with the improvement of the access to the health system, drugs policies, maternal health education program.

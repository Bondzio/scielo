Abstract This essay deals with the theoretical framework that underlies a conception of the subject as a plural and reflexive agent. Our intention is to present some authors and strands that have contributed to the formulation and understanding of the plurality and reflexivity of the subject. Based on a critical review of literature, we discuss aspects presented in various researches as evidence that - whatever the theoretical strands of referred authors - several scholars have pointed to the reflexivity and plurality as constitutive of social actors. We finally argue that (a) the multiple pluralities present in contemporary society allow to imply the plurality of subjectivation processes concerning to social subjects; (b) several authors point out the centrality of this reflexive subject in the social processes in which he is inserted.

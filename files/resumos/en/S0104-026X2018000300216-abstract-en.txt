Abstract: Materialist feminism is one of the main theoretical currents of French feminist thought. This reflection, promoted by authors like Christine Delphy, Colette Guillaumin, Nicole-Claude Mathieu and Monique Wittig emerges amidst intense feminist mobilizations in the 1970s in France and produces inescapable contributions to the feminist debate in that country. This article proposes to present the emergence of these theorizations and some of their central ideas. Starting from different types of sources such as pamphlets, texts from militant magazines and other unpublished materials, the objective is to address such theories in the historical and theoretical context in which these analyzes have emerged.

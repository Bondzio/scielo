Abstract: A "gender equality" discourse and new references around the meanings of the feminine and masculine have been established in Chile since the 1990s. These have been accompanied by a displacement of the "gender question" toward a spectrum of women who do not come from the feminist world, but raise demands for more equal conditions in relation to men in the areas in which they operate. This article presents a reflection on the characteristics acquired by this 'discourse of equality' to which the transformations in the economic field have contributed, exploring the gender conceptions that emerge from the proposals of one of the female organizations that arise in the early 2000s, oriented to the world of business and entrepreneurship.

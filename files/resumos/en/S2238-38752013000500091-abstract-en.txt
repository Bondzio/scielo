Abstract This article seeks to recuperate the economic sociology of Pierre Bourdieu which entails a critique of the neoclassic theory based upon a wealth of empirical materials. In his studies on Algerian economy it is possible to observe the genesis of the concept of habitus and of symbolic capital and to examine their applicability to capitalist economy. Both concepts underscore a relational mode of thinking and of conceptualizing field. Field articulates a socially construed space in which agents, far from being interchangeable, confront each other using different resources and interacting to produce change, maintain or transform prevailing relations of force. Objecting to an universal economic rationality ascribed to human nature, Bourdieu foregrounds the historicity of economy. Thus the history of the process of differentiation and autonomization includes the constitution of a specific game: the economic field complies with its own rules.

This paper aims at analysing the contribution of feminist theories for the epistemology and methodological practices of the social sciences, namely of social psychology. Departing from the presentation of Third Wave feminist proposals and from the dialogical epistemology of social representations, we discuss the possibilities for a conceptualisation based on situated knowledges, for the development of emancipatory scientific knowledges. Hence, we will debate the way how situated knowledges and the challenges they pose can change scientific praxis in social psychology and in social sciences.

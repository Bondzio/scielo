ABSTRACT The aim of this article is to analyze the jurist as an agent of social transformation and law as the motor driving such transformation. The analysis presupposes a reconstruction of Bourdieu which could overcome the criticism that the author had a theory of social "determination" that did not allow the consideration of possibilities of social "transformation", especially through law. The first query is how law can contribute to social emancipation, then how the jurist can become an agent of social emancipation and finally what kind of research in the sociology of law is inspired by Bourdieu. This should allow the reader to consider the specific form of the political struggle in which jurists can participate through law in what Bourdieu calls the historical construction of reason.

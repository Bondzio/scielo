Abstract In this seminal essay, Jeffrey Alexander presents some of the foundations of his iconic turn. The proposed analytical shift is based on an understanding of the aesthetic and moral content of materiality, which is synthesized in the notion of iconic consciousness: the process in which an observer articulates the aesthetic surface of a materiality to a certain moral structure of social values.

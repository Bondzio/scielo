This paper intends to systematize and deepen the questioning regarding the space of Education Pedagogical, Didactic, Methodological, and Practical manuals, used in courses for future teachers, in the national and international production and circulation of pedagogical and professional discourse. The reflection continues previous studies by the authors from a comparative socio-historical perspective, within a more far-reaching project entitled: Comparative study on school: Brazil and Portugal (Nineteenth and twentieth centuries), financed on the Brazilian side by the agreement Capes-ICCTI. This collaboration is also within the scope of Prestige, a program financed by the European Union. The article presents a reasonably extensive study on the literature produced on school manuals for teachers, analyzing the predominance of certain topics and specific research guidelines in the area. These elements help understand how productions on the object of study have been generated and circulated, collaborating to build the history of the history of pedagogical manuals and of the educational discourse.

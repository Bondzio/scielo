Urbanization is an irreversible global process and the number of people living in cities is estimated to reach 67% of the world population by 2050. In low- and middle-income countries, 30% to 40% of the population currently lives in slum areas, under risk of several diseases. Even though 84.3% of the Brazilian population already lived in urban areas in 2010, no consistent initiatives have been implemented to address urban health issues. We discuss here the epidemiological features of communicable diseases that are relevant to public health (dengue, HIV/aids, leptospirosis, leprosy and tuberculosis) in Brazil's 17 metropolitan areas since 2000 to help clarify the current role of infections in the context of Brazilian urban health.

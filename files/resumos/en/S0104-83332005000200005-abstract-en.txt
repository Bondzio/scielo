When academics and social agents use categories such as prostitution, sex tourism and 'trafficking', they erase the diversity of projects and impulses that are found among people who travel to work, who facilitate travels to work and who live from the sex trade. This erasing in turn reproduces stigmatizing and controlling discourses that justify interventions by those who want to 'help' but who understand very little of what actually goes on in the ground during migration processes. These discourses also fail to examine how Europeans participate in migration questions: tourists who want to enjoy their holidays, who may become fond of 'natives' and who more and more often wish to pay others for domestic, caring and sexual services in Europe.

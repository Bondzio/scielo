Abstract: This paper proposes to understand how women scientists are embedded in the production of scientific and technological knowledge in specific federal public universities in the Northeast of Brazil. The interviews and direct observations in daily life scientific work made possible the construction of reflections grounded on the social experiences of women scientists belonging to two knowledge's branches: humanities and supposed "hard sciences". Through this partial and situated approach, about insertion and permanence of women in contemporary science, we could observe the conservation of old issues that remain as important for feminist and gender studies of science.

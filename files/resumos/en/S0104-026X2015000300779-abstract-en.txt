This article investigates how gender norms mark the functioning of the pedagogical discourse of Medicine in a curriculum of medical training. From participant observations added to a line of action inspired by the analytic discourse of Michel Foucault, it is argued that the curriculum of Medicine consists of a set of discourses that position gendered bodies articulating them around a medicalization of morality sex as a sexual moralizing Medicine. When connecting reproduction, cognitive abilities and processes of health care in gendered relationship matrix, this paper explores, thus, how discourse strategies supplement and transform the medical horizon conceived as homogeneous and stable in a set of meanings that indicate that Medicine, or at least medical education, perhaps not be as biomedical as well.

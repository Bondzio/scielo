Abstract: Under the bias of multicultural feminism, the concepts of relationality, discourse positioning and intersectionalities of oppressions are instrumental for a better understanding of the multiple perspectives that inform current feminist practices, anchored in post/decolonial knowledges and aesthetics. Our discussion aims to address political practices and aesthetics adopted by women from very diverse social and geographic places. The artistic/cultural production that is developed through varied languages and narratives promotes possibilities to foster poetics of gender resistance and decolonization that challenge our traditional understanding of the aesthetic, political, and epistemological.

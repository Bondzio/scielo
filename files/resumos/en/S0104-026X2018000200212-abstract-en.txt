Abstract: This article presents a genealogy of the Christian discourse on the "gender ideology" developed in our society during the preceding years and which has influenced a number of bills in the Brazilian Congress. This discourse has been developed by Catholic intellectuals in the 1990 decade as a reaction to the initiative of feminist groups that managed to include the gender category in the documents of the United Nations social Conferences. Next, the article analyses how this Christian discourse has been spread in the political sphere and in the civil society by Catholic and Evangelical actors who reject the adoption of the gender category in public policies. In the final considerations, the challenges to be faced by feminist and LGBTT movements in the next years are reviewed.

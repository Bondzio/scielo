ABSTRACT The poetry of Manuel Bandeira, one of the most prolific Brazilian poets of the twentieth century, drew the attention of the literary criticism of both Mário de Andrade and Sérgio Buarque de Holanda. The aim of this article is to analyze the criteria that support the critical approaches of Andrade and Holanda to the poetry of Manuel Bandeira, using as a starting point the poet&#8217;s sincere artistic trajectory. In the case of Mário de Andrade, this concept seems to reconsider the reflections on the technique of poetry developed systematically in &#8220;O artista e o artesão&#8221;. In the case of Sérgio Buarque, the concept seems to figure as one of the fuels of the revolution against Brazilian &#8220;cordiality&#8221;, as defined in Roots of Brazil.

When the agrarian world seemed just to have stepped into the agroindustrial stage, with high technology application and inexorable population displacement, the issue of land and the access to it, as well as the struggle to keep it become top-level problems in neoliberal policy-stricken Latin America. This work shows that this new centrality of the struggle for land is a typical situation of the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st Century, allowing for conceptions about these new times. In order to do that, it reviews mid-20th-century approaches and presents new post-structuralist conceptualizations. However, the new nonclass conceptualizations might allow us to consider that any agrarian struggle is a struggle for a fairer and more egalitarian society. The work is based precisely on actions by Uruguayan and Argentinean small farmers, whose demands are corporative and cannot be equaled to those by subordinate sectors for their lost or never acquired rights. In the Argentinean case, new rural workers' movements are added as well as those by indebted small farmers, who in the 90s heralded the great rebellions of late 2001 - the "new agrarian protest".

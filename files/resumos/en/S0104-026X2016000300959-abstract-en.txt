Abstract: The Cape Verdean migration to São Tomé e Príncipe, which started in the early 20th century (from 1900 to 1970) in a scheme of hired work to the coffee and cocoa farmsteads, was and is still being built in the Cape Verdean social imaginary as a portrait of "forced emigration" and "bad emigration". With the arts of making tchabeta and the musical narratives of the groups Ouro Verde and Raiz di Tera, I discuss hereby the work of creation of this Cape Verdean territory in São Tomé e Príncipe by the Cape Verdeans in the fields, as a place (among others) from where they speak and create these counter-narratives. Likewise, as a locus from where they speak and postulate narratives of protests inscribed in a project of writing their own stories related to the conditions of the women in the São Tomé and Príncipe society.

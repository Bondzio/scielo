Based on cultural studies and employing some notions derived from gender studies, this article focuses on the resignification carried out by a specific community of male teachers in relation to a magazine article announcing the emergence of a "new man". We discuss the media's important role in shifts that have recently taken place in social relationships, as it represents and amplifies the meaning of these changes under way, with a high level of interest in issues related with masculinities. Based upon a characterization of masculinity as a cultural historical construct we analyze how, in a permanent negotiation set in the day to day lives of the subjects, new repertoires of behaviors and habits are rehearsed and reinforced.

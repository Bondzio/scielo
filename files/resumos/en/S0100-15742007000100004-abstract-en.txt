This article addresses the discussions about the definition of curricular guidelines for the Pedagogy Course, as well as the oppositions to them, which occurred after the passage of the National Educational Guidelines and Framework Law of 1996. It focuses the process of mobilization and resistance of the institutions in the educational area in order to ensure teaching as the basis for this course and the overcoming of the dichotomy between teacher certification (licenciatura) and bachelor degree in its interior. The analysis indicates that the central issue is the opposition to the education model of Higher Education Institutes and Higher Basic Education Teacher Education Programs, created by the education reform in the 1990s, which is inserted in a context of neoliberal policies. It also shows that the recent passage of the curricular guidelines for the Pedagogy Course (Official Opinion CNE/CP 5/2005 and Resolution CNE/CP 1/2006) and its definition as a teacher education program that educates the teacher both for the pre-primary school and for the initial grades of primary school, is a solution negotiated between the institutions and the National Council of Education.

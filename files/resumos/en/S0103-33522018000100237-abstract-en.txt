Abstract: This study presents the proposal of unifying the corruption concepts. For methodological reasons the paper is divided into three parts. The first part deals with a list of concepts found among the main scholars in the subject and I present a critical analysis of such concepts. The second part encompasses the presentation of new methodology of concepts, the criteria for structuring concepts, the explanation of &#8216;Min-Max&#8217; strategy and the multidimensionality of the concepts in three levels. The third part introduces the new concept of corruption along with its schematic outline, and finally a quality testing of the concept through the methodology presented in the previous section. The conclusion shows that the new concept has a broader usefulness and is more operational compared to the previous ones.

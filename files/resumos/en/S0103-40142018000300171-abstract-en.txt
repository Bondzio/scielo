ABSTRACT The teaching of Algebra has been restricted to technical and operational issues, often leaving aside the development of concepts and so-called algebraic thinking. We believe that this approach underlies the deficiencies diagnosed in various government surveys and assessments. In this text, we present how concepts that were relevant to the development of Algebra over the centuries can and should participate in the process of teaching Algebra.

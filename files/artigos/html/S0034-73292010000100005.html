It reviews   Turkish capabilities, namely its military capabilities, which could provide   the EU with valuable defense assets. There are differences related to Turkey's   relations with the EU, which have increasingly spilled over into the NATO,   hindering the development of cooperation over crisis management operations.   The article then delves in the implications of Turkey's strategic geographical   location to EU policies. It reviews how far the EU and Turkey may have convergent   interests in some of the neighboring regions, especially in the Middle East. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Key-words:</b> Turkey; European Union; European Security and Defense Policy; Islam.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">O presente artigo analisa o impacto da poss&iacute;vel  ades&atilde;o da Turquia &agrave; Uni&atilde;o   Europeia (UE) em termos da pol&iacute;tica externa, de seguran&ccedil;a e defesa.

Turkey finally began talks on joining the   European Union in October 2005, more than 40 years after it first began to   woo the European bloc: Turkey applied for associate membership of the EEC<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><sup>1</sup></a> back   in 1959. On October 3, 2005, the European Union formally initiated accession   negotiations with Turkey. Unfortunately, the membership prospects have dimmed   since the Brussels decision.<a name="tx02"></a><a href="#nt02"><sup>2</sup></a> Turkey's EU membership bid has stalled. The disagreement   comes against a background of prominent politicians in several EU countries&#32;&#150;&#32;namely   France and Germany&#32;&#150;&#32;questioning whether the predominantly Muslim country should   ever become a member because of its different culture (Fernandes, 2007). An   important reason behind the European Council 2004 decision's to elevate Turkey's   status to that of candidate country is the EU's evolving security and defence   role. EU's policies towards Turkey are shaped by the calculus of the potential   benefits of Turkey's inclusion into the EU's Common European Security and Defense   Policy (CESDP) and the costs entailed by its exclusion. This motive does not   preclude the existence of other rationales, such as the EU's desire to influence   Turkey's politics in a positive direction and to resolve the problem over the   Cyprus division (M&uuml;ft&uuml;ler-Bac, 2000, 489). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With the end of the Cold War, Turkey has a set of new foreign policy options&#32;&#150;&#32;in   the Balkans, Middle East, Caucasus and Black Sea&#32;&#150;&#32;which are both an asset   and a source of concern, either for itself, and for the EU. The demise of the   bipolar system radically changed the strategic dynamics in the Middle East,   creating a window of opportunity for improved relations and co-operation between   Turkey and major actors in this region. The 11 September attacks contributed   to further changing the underlying dynamics of international politics in the   region. Within some circles in EU countries, there is increasing recognition   that, in the post-11 September, post-Iraq war international environment, Turkey   is indeed a pivotal country. In the current international setting, Turkey's   strategic importance has increased. Turkey today stands at the nexus of several   geopolitical areas of critical importance to the EU states. In each of these   areas, Turkish cooperation is essential for achieving EU policy goals.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>Turkey's assets</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When one reflect on Turkey's contribution to Europe's security, it is important   to bear in mind the following facts and figures:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#149;  it shares land borders with countries that are decisive for the security      of the Middle East: 500km with Iran, 330km with Iraq and 820km with Syria;</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#149;  its large population (72 million) and booming economy make it an important     regional power; </font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#149;  its army is the second largest standing military within NATO, the 9th largest     in the world, with over 515,000 active troops and an additional 380,000 reserves     (Globalsecurity.org). Membership in NATO and cooperation with the Israeli     military has helped it become the most powerful army of Europe, after Russia     and UK. It spends 5,3% of its GDP on defense; in comparison, the US spends     4%, the United Kingdom 2,3% and France 2,4% (Gomes, 2007);</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#149;  Turkey has the second-largest land forces in NATO after the USA, ranks 5<SUP>th</SUP> in     terms of naval forces and operates one of the largest combat aircraft fleets     of NATO undergoing a defense modernization program laid out in the final years     of the Cold War to develop a force capable of integrated airland battle as     part of NATO: it has 10,5% of NATO's fighter jets, 20% of cargo planes and     22,5% of inventory jets (Gasparini, 2004, 25). Ankara can be decisive in closing     the glaring capabilities/expectations gap affecting ESDP (European Security     and Defense Policy), which will continue to grow in the years to come. The     EU's declared goal of being able to deploy 60,000 soldiers&#32;&#150;&#32;the kind of force     that could serve as peacekeepers in hot spots like Bosnia and Kosovo&#32;&#150;&#32;will     require up to 200,000 soldiers because of rotation needs. In 2006, the European     allies, with two million soldiers on paper, had trouble fielding peacekeeping     forces in Lebanon, mustering barely half of the 15,000 troops called for by     United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolution 1701;</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#149;  the EU has shortfalls from the previous Headline Goal<a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><sup>3</sup></a> (for instance, gaps related     to strategic airlift and sealift) which are still considered to be a limiting     factor to the operability of the designated forces, especially in more demanding     crisis management operations. With twenty-six C130/C160 transport aircrafts     (and ten Airbus A400Ms to be delivered in 2010), the Turkish military can     deploy 50,000 troops to conduct joint operations on short notice. With air     refueling capability, the Turkish air force is also able to participate in     overseas operations. Turkey was among the few significant contributors to     the EU operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Operation Artemis,     providing the crucial airlift capability that is in short supply in the EU;</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#149;  Turkey has shown in the past, namely in the Western Balkans and Afghanistan,     that it is a reliable provider of troops to UN-backed international peacekeeping:     in Afghanistan in particular, Turkey took command of ISAF for a period of     eight months in 2002-2003 and again in February 2005. In practice, Turkey     has participated in all EU-led military operations, apart from the operation     in the Congo. Last but not least, Turkish contribution in the military-industrial     domain could be very useful, and the country's participation&#32;&#150;&#32;from the start&#32;&#150;&#32;in     the A400M programme is a sign of its commitment to the European defense industry     (Gomes, 2007).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>Turkey's participation in EU security</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The added value of Turkey for the EU in the field of security is well-known.   One of the useful ways to measure the future utility of Turkey for EU in the   field of security is to analyse its present behaviour. On the positive side,   one has to mention that the EU and Turkey have already begun to integrate their   foreign policies in the pre-accession period. In fact this process has begun   with Turkey's association with the EU's nascent security and defense policy   (Emerson and Tocci, 2004). Turkey could add&#32;&#150;&#32;and, in fact, already adds&#32;&#150;&#32;an   important set of diplomatic, cultural and political tools to the EU's external   action. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ankara's active participation in almost all ESDP missions is certainly laudable,   and indicates a commitment to a Europe of Defense: Turkey has offered troops,   aircraft and command structures to seven EU missions (three military operations   and four civilian missions) (Medina-Abell&aacute;n, 2008, 6). On the negative   side, EU-NATO cooperation has long been suffering from Turkey's intransigence   concerning ESDP (European Security and Defense Policy) as far as the the application   of the Berlin Plus arrangements<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><sup>4</sup></a> is concerned. Angered by the stalemate in EU   accession talks, Turkey has blocked the whole EU-NATO strategic partnership   and the conducting of military operations involving both organizations. There   are several reasons which account for Turkey's attitude: one is the recurrent   problem with Cyprus;<a name="tx05"></a><a href="#nt05"><sup>5</sup></a> the other is that it feels its rights as a third-participating   country in ESDP are not sufficient; and thirdly, the sense that it lost a privileged   position in the WEU (Western European Union).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Turkey has been an associate member of the Western European Union<a name="tx06"></a><a href="#nt06"><sup>6</sup></a> since 1992.   Associate membership was created to include the European countries that were   members of NATO but not of the European Union. The agreement on associate membership   allowed for a well-integrated role of associate (and observer) members into   the WEU structure,<a name="tx07"></a><a href="#nt07"><sup>7</sup></a> although without full decision-making rights in WEU.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In the finalization process of the ESDP, Turkey has been very reluctant to   give up the rights that it had acquired within the old Western European Union   framework, an organisation which was absorbed into the European Union after   2001. After the December 1998 Saint-Malo Summit,<a name="tx08"></a><a href="#nt08"><sup>8</sup></a> the EU has started to claim   a larger role in terms of defense. This initiative paved the way for the Cologne   Summit's decision of June 1999 to merge the WEU and the EU. At the December   1999 Helsinki Summit, the European Council adopted a number of measures to   advance the CESDP, stating its "determination to develop an autonomous   capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, to launch   and conduct EU-led military operations in response to international crisis" (European   Council, 1999). The EU members agreed to build, by 2003, a military force of   about 50,000&#150;60,000 troops capable of performing and sustaining the full range of Petersberg tasks. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">New institutions were created on 1 March 2000 for managing the EU's evolving   defense role. In November 2000, the WEU Council of Ministers meeting in Marseilles,   took a number of decisions relating to the transfer of its operational role   to the European Union. To Turkey's dismay, during the subsequent December 2000   Nice summit, the non-EU members of NATO were totally excluded from the decision-making   structures.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the aftermath of the announcement of the ESDP, Turkey said it was prepared   to take part in the ESDP and to provide 6,000 troops for the rapid reaction   force. In exchange, it said it wanted to have a voice in decision making and   planning processes and be treated as a full-fledged and equal partner on issues   that affected its security in the region. It would not acquiesce in the EU's   automatic use of NATO capabilities and assets, underlining that it was prepared   to consider the use of its veto if the situation required (Kuniholm, 2001).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In October 2002, an agreement was reached concerning the participation of   non-EU NATO allies in ESDP. These arrangements were elaborated further in the   context of the "NATO-EU Declaration on ESDP", agreed on 16 December   2002, and the Berlin Plus arrangements, adopted on 17 March 2003.   They have enabled the use of NATO assets and capabilities by the EU as part   of the ESDP operations. Ankara has sought assurances that it will be involved   in the planning and decisionmaking in EU crisis management operations, especially   those that directly affect its own security interests. This has only become   possible under the Ankara agreement of 2001, which stipulates that Turkey automatically   participates in EU-led military operations in the event that NATO assets and   capabilities are used. The agreement also assured that EU missions would never   be directed against an ally (Medina-Abell&aacute;n, 2008, 3; Haine, 2004, 3).   Berlin Plus respected Turkey's sensitivities on the exclusion of the Republic   of Cyprus (Fernandes, 2008): Cyprus remained outside the area of responsibility   of ESDP; a potential force would never be deployed in the Eastern Mediterranean   (Medina-Abell&aacute;n: 2008, 3; Dinela: 2002, 2). In a situation where NATO   assets and capabilities are not used&#32;&#150;&#32;a EU-only operation&#32;&#150;&#32;Turkey can only   participate if the European Council invites it. The EU also accepted Turkey's   involvement in the operational planning stage, provide it contributes with forces. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkey feels that the EU in recent years violated the Berlin Plus agreement   and tried to exclude Turkey from joint operations where NATO's capabilities   are used. It feels the elaboration of ESDP, due to the change of the pivotal   operational role from NATO to the EU, has amounted to the decline of Turkey's   role. Turkey retains its strong interest in European security arrangements   and in ensuring itself a continuing and pre-eminent role in NATO. What worries   Turkey about the creation of an EU defense force is that it is located in a   very volatile zone. The areas near Turkey's borders are those most likely to   be the location of EU future crisis management or peacekeeping missions. New   missions in defense of common interests are most likely to be performed on   the European southern and eastern periphery (in the Balkans or even farther   afield, such as Afghanistan and Iraq highlight). Already, most of NATO's current   planning scenarios involve contingencies in Turkey's neighborhood, many involving   Turkey itself (Lesser, 2000).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The latest crisis between Turkey and NATO occurred during ongoing negotiations   to sort out the modalities of an EU administrative mission including EU police   force to enable the smooth transition of Kosovo to independence&#32;&#150;&#32;European   Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo&#32;&#150;&#32;"EULEX Kosovo"&#32;&#150;&#32;(Council of   the EU, 2008). The EU administrative mission, which has also sought to include   a Greek Cypriot police force, took over from the UN mission which has performed   that function hitherto, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in   Kosovo. In Kosovo, NATO's military mission, KFOR and EULEX are therefore expected   to work together as the military and civilian arms of security. Turkey informed   Brussels that it would veto the EU's planned police mission to Kosovo to use   NATO capabilities due to the presence of the Greek Cypriots in the mission (Gürcanl&#305;, 2008).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkey blocked those plans in protest against a longstanding Cypriot veto   of closer defense ties between it and the EU. Cyprus refuses to allow Turkey   to join the EU's European Defense Agency (EDA), a body which is meant to streamline   EU defense procurement and planning, since it fears that this would give Turkey   access to its military secrets. A similar situation occured in 2007, when the   EU sent a police mission, including Greek Cypriots, to Afghanistan. Turkey's   stance has affected cooperation between NATO's 40,000-strong peace force in   Afghanistan and a much smaller EU police mission of around 150 staff.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The most negative consequence of Turkey's insistence that all contacts between   EU and NATO take place under Berlin Plus, is the exclusion of the two only   EU members that are neither NATO members nor members of the Alliance's Partnership   for Peace: Cyprus and Malta. Thus, the EU cannot come to terms with the fact   that Cyprus and Malta be excluded whenever terrorism, Afghanistan, Kosovo,   or Darfur are discussed, which means that NATO and the EU can only meet on   these issues informally, or staff-to-staff. Turkey's actions work as a serious   break on EU-NATO relations (Medina-Abell&aacute;n: 2008, 7-8), and, more importantly,   they put European, American, but also Afghan and Kosovar lives at risk, since   the two organisations are unable to seriously coordinate their actions in providing   security to their own people in uniform and to those living in the countries   they are trying to stabilize.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Making sure the right security arrangements are in place between ISAF and   the EU's police mission in Afghanistan, for example, has been an ordeal and   has seriously undermined the international community's reputation in the country.   If Turkey's defense establishment were truly committed to EU membership, they   would try their best to solve any ambiguities in the country's participation   in ESDP through patient negotiation.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Differences related to Turkey's relations with the EU have increasingly spilled   over into the NATO arena and affected Turkey's relations with the Alliance.   Currently, differences with the EU over Cyprus are hindering the development   of NATO-EU cooperation over crisis management and the application of the Berlin   Plus arrangements. While not opposed to the expansion of the EU's role in security   and defense matters, Turkey does not want the EU initiative to undermine the   impact of NATO and the transatlantic link and to erode NATO's deterrence power.   The possibility of EU-initiated operations and other activities might weaken   NATO's role, reducing Turkey's ability to infuence European security, and adversely   affect Turkey's security (Medina-Abell&aacute;n: 2008, 10). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The EU perception is that Turkey very often uses ESDP as a hostage of the   EU membership negotiations: "Turkey believes that its huge military capabilities,   its prominent role in European security and its involvement in ESDP are the   main backgate of its accession to the EU ()" (Medina-Abell&aacute;n:   2008, 10). Maybe it is not a coincidence that Turkey's announcement it was   downgrading its participation in ESDP, came immediately after Nicolas Sarkozy's   victory in the presidential elections. Every time Turkey uses its participation   in ESDP to pressure the EU and its supporters within the EU, it scuttles its   own case.<a name="tx09"></a><a href="#nt09"><sup>9</sup></a> Every time Turkey stands in the way of EU/NATO cooperation on Afghanistan,   Kosovo, or the fight against terrorism; every time it reacts to Cyprus' destructive   veto of Ankara's participation in the EDA with a counter-productive punishment   of the EU as a whole; every time it expresses its skepticism about ESDP generally,   Turkey is sacrificing a long-term goal that will endow it with true influence   over the future of the Europe of Defense&#32;&#150;&#32;EU membership &#150;, for a short-term vindication.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Arguably, Turkey's exclusion could impact Ankara's long-term commitment to   European defense, especially since ensuring Turkish integration into the European   security domain would anchor Turkey firmly to the West. That value, however,   is not without some qualifications. While Turkey's strategic value is widely   accepted within the EU, there are those who see it as an outsider to the European   mainstream, condemned to irresolvable difference from its western European   neighbors and with frontiers which are a liability. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>Turkey's pivotal position</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other hand, the evidence is there to suggest that Turkey's stability   and its Western alignment are advantageous for the EU since the anticipated   threats to the security of the Union originate from the Greater Middle East   and the Islamic world at large. The importance of the relations between Turkey   and the EU is best appreciated in the context of the new security environment,   of the plans for an international order in upheaval and the formation and implementation   of a coherent, global EU foreign policy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The arguments Turkey puts forward to make its case as a foreign and security   policy asset to the EU, have been set out by Prime Minister Recep Erdogan.   They include:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#150;  Turkey's accession would lead to an extended reach of the European Neighborhood     policy. Turkey's neighbors would have a border with the EU;</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#150;  Turkey has a geographical location that makes it a hub for regional cooperation;</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#150;  Turkey is an increasingly sought-after secure energy-transport hub for oil     from the Caspian, Middle East and Russia;</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#150;  Turkey is well situated to become a forward base for the EU's security and     defense policy, for military logistics and for asserting the EU's presence     in the region.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#150;  Turkey has valuable human resources to complement those of the EU for cooperation     programmes, ranging from business know-how to language skills (Emerson and     Tocci, 2004, 9).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One major argument that links up to this rationale is that, due to its location,   Turkey is a strong candidate to become one of the world's most important gas   and petroleum terminals in the short term. Through its proactive energy diplomacy,   the pipelines in Turkish territory indicate it has become a regional center   for energy transportation. Already a vital conduit for sending energy from   east to west, Turkey is set to grow in importance as more pipelines come on   stream. The most notable is Nabucco, a proposed 7.9 billion ($11.7 billion)   scheme to carry gas across Turkey from Azerbaijan and possibly Turkmenistan,   Iran, Iraq and Egypt. This should go some way to reducing Russia's influence   over the continent's energy supplies. Moscow now provides Europe with a quarter   of its gas needs (Day, 2009).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Emerson and Tocci have identified ten major theatres of operation in Turkey's   vicinity, which one can identify as representing the main common foreign and   security concerns of both the EU and Turkey. These consist of the set of Turkey's   neighbors, which may be taken as sub-regional groups or major states. The Balkans,   the Black Sea, South Caucasus, Central Asia, Russia, Mediterranean, the Middle   East, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. These regions also concern the   two other major powers that also have important interests in these regions&#32;&#150;&#32;Russia   and the United States. The authors have concluded that in most cases the interests   and policies may be respectively convergent and complementary. If Turkey and   the EU share the same vision and similar interests, that would raise the prospects   of jointly and more effectively tackling their shared objectives. In that sense, "future   Turkish and EU foreign policies could become complementary and mutually reinforcing" (Emerson   and Tocci: 2004, 10). Synergies could be materialised in practice, enhancing   the capabilities and credibility of the EU as a foreign policy actor and potentially transforming present challenges in future assets and mediation skills. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By setting an example of a modern, secular democratic state and society, capable   of coexisting in harmony with the Muslim tradition, Turkey could help ease   the tensions and play the role conventionally ascribded as a bridge between   the two civilisations. As Emerson and Tocci argue: "democratising Turkey   would be the bridgehead of a modern, multi-cultural Europe right up to and   alongside the ideological chaos and violence of the neighborhood beyond. Its   civilian, military and human resources could be integrated with those of the   EU and serve as a spearhead of the EU's soft and not-so-soft power projection   into the region" (Emerson and Tocci: 2004, 34). At a time, when the "global   war on terror" has created global tension and division, and where 11 September   created a backlash experienced by Muslims worldwide, Turkey's relations to the EU take on a broad geopolitical significance.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This security-based argument, by turning the tables on the stereotyped idea   that it would be undesirable for the EU to border Iran, Iraq and Syria as well   as a turbulent southern Caucasus, sees Turkey's accession as an asset for the   EU. Indeed, the harmonization of EU and Turkish foreign policy would be an   important qualification for the realisation of the Union's claim that it is   a global actor. Turkey's geopolitical location and military capabilities would   enhance the EU's standing as a global actor when it becomes a member. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Additionally, Turkey's neighborhood in the eastern Mediterranean, the Balkans,   the Middle East and Eurasian regions has become the main source of Europe's   security concerns: weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and illegal trafficking   of drugs and people. These were identified as priority areas in the European   security strategy adopted by the EU in December 2003 (Solana, 2003). Any meaningful   European role in the fight against the proliferation of WMD, terrorism and   drug trafficking, will have to include Turkey and its important diplomatic   ties and experience. Secondly, the EU's European Neighborhood policy (European   Commission, 2004), which would be extended naturally to the east with Turkey's   accession, would become to a large extent a Euro-Turkish Neighborhood policy.   Moreover, Turkey offers a number of specific potential assets for helping the   EU tackle these concerns, ranging from the concrete realities of location and   logistics, through to matters of language and culture, which would facilitate   contacts and exchanges with countries in the area.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkey's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's doctrine that Turkey must not   regard itself as a "bridge" country&#32;&#150;&#32;which sounds somewhat a given   fact of History&#32;&#150;&#32;but as a "center" country&#32;&#150;&#32;the key player in its   immediate area. Some anaysts consider Davutoglu's vision as "neo-Ottomanism" (Taspinar,   2008). Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan's has described Turkey's foreign policy   aim as "zero problems" vis-a-vis its neighbors. In the last years,   Turkey has opened channels of dialogue with almost all its neighbors (Aydintasbas,   2009; Djavadi, 2009). Turkish foreign policy strategy requires maintaining   neutral ties with the various, and some formerly, antagonists. Turkeys's "rising   star", to say it with expert Hugh Pope, has led it to strike a balance   between friend and foe and even to create a circle of friends through active   and unrelenting diplomacy (Pope, 2008). Yet, a reason for the success of AKP's   government approach, is that it takes place in the context of a regional power   vacuum. The late 2001 intervention of the U.S. and the EU into Afghanistan   and the undoing of Iraq, the potential players in the game and their relative   balance of power has changed. From this perspective, the new states of the   region sought to align themselves, economically, politically and militarily   with diverse partners in an environment largely established by the contest   of these various powers: Russia, the US, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China (Ferguson: 2007, 1).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The traditional Arab powers' influence is waning. The chaotic security situation   in Iraq partly explains Turkey's ascendance, bolstered by Ankara's election,   in late 2008, to the Security Council as a nonpermanent member. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In effect, Turkey is on its way to resolving its only disputed borders: one   is Armenia, the other is Cyprus. The most salient examples are the efforts   to restore normal relations with Armenia and with the Iraqi Kurdish. The process   of normalising Turkish-Armenian is the most important element of Turkey's new   policy towards the Caucasus (EurActiv, 2009). In October, Turkey and Armenia   have at last signed a historic accord. Under the agreement, Turkey and Armenia   are to establish diplomatic ties and reopen their shared border. This should   enable them to make peace and to close the contested matter of the Turkish   massacres perpetrated against the Armenians in the second half of the World   War I. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians died in 1915, when they were deported   en masse from eastern Anatolia by the Ottoman Empire. They were killed by troops   or died from starvation and disease. Armenia wants Turkey to recognise the   killings as an act of genocide, a situation described by many, in Europe and   in the US in those terms, but successive Turkish governments have refused to   do so. If the move succeeds (it still has to be approved in Parliament, overcoming   the likely opposition of Turkish nationalists and the pressures from Azrebaijan),<a name="tx10"></a><a href="#nt10"><sup>10</sup></a>  Turkey could reinforce its prestige as a broker, a regional peacemeaker with   a stabilising influence in a volatile region. This move could bolster Turkey's   case for EU accession and win back Ankara's reputation of reformist determination,   which has faded in the second mandate<a name="tx11"></a><a href="#nt11"><sup>11</sup></a> of the AKP-led government. The decision   will also help Armenia overcome its regional isolation and will open new commercial   gateways westward to the economy of landlocked Armenia.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the negative side, the reality is that Turkey faces a much more diverse   set of security threats and challenges: growing Kurdish nationalism and separatism;   increasing sectarian violence in Iraq that threatens to spill over and draw   in outside powers; an increasingly assertive Iran that may develop nuclear   weapons; and a weak, fragmented Lebanon dominated by radical groups with close   ties with Syria and Iran. Most of these threats are on Turkey's periphery with   the Middle East (Larrabee: 2008, 3). Although Turkey is certainly a potential   asset for the EU in the field of security, Europe is not willing to import   insecurity with the Turkish accession and demands that Ankara solves a number   of pending conflicts. In other words, as long as Turkey does not solve its   Kurdish problem; as long as its bilateral relationship with Iraq is not stabilized;   as long as it doesn't fully consolidate its relationship with Armenia; and,   as long as it doesn't withdraw its troops from Northern Cyprus, EU leaders   will be unable to sell Turkish membership as a security-plus to their citizens&#32;&#150;&#32;quite   apart from many other factors where Turkey has made significant inroads accession-wise.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>Turkey: drawn into an unstable Middle East neighborhood</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkish attention today is focused much more intensely on the Middle East   than in the past. As a result, the tension between Turkey's Western identity   and its Middle Eastern orientation is likely to grow (Larrabee: 2008, 3). This   is where the key challenges to Turkish security are located. Turkey is likely   to be drawn more heavily into the Middle East by the Kurdish issue, Iran's   nuclear ambitions, and other regional crisis. As a result, the tension between   Turkey's Western identity and its Middle Eastern orientation is likely to grow   (Larrabee: 2008, vii). Prime Minister Erdogan's government has worked intensively   to improve cooperation with Turkey's Middle Eastern neighbors. This year, efforts   recently took on momentum, with a growing number of high-level visits and cooperation   pacts being signed in a range of areas from culture to security, in what some   call a process of regional integration similar to the one in Europe. In the   past seven years the value of Turkey's exports to the Middle East and north   Africa has grown nearly sevenfold, reaching $31 billion in 2008 (The Economist,   2009). After all, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan party, the AKP (Justice and   Development Party) derives from a political Islam movement in Turkey. There   is a tendency among some observers to attribute changes in Ankara's foreign   policy to AKP's roots in Turkey's Islamist movement. Many analysts fear Turkish   relations with the Muslim world may come at the expense of Turkey's Western   orientation. They say that, as the AKP loses faith in the EU process, it will   lead to a stronger interest and involvement in the Middle East. Howeer, one   must take into account the structural changes in international politics that   coincide roughly with the two wars against Iraq and the changes in the regional   power balance (Cook: 2007, 28).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Currently, the most pressing issue on Turkey's agenda is its relationship   with Iraq. Turkey has its own interests in the evolving situation in Iraq and   is watching developments there with great concern. Ankara thinks the situation   has the potential to be highly destabilising if it deteriorates further. Civil   war or a fragmented Iraq, and the possible emergence of an independent Kurdistan   in the northwest, would impact strongly on Turkish foreign policy, especially   if Ankara feels compelled to intervene there to contain the fallout. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The most important external challenge Turkey faces today is Kurdish nationalism.   In the aftermath of the invasion, Iraq has degenerated into sectarian violence   and the Kurdish push for autonomy&#32;&#150;&#32;and eventual independence&#32;&#150;&#32;has been strengthened.   As a result, Turkey today confronts the prospect that an independent Kurdish   state will emerge on its southeastern border, which could strengthen separatist   pressures among Turkey's own Kurdish population. Since 2004, Turkey has faced   an escalation of PKK-led<a name="tx12"></a><a href="#nt12"><sup>12</sup></a> separatist violence. Turkey is also concerned about   the intention of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Northern Iraq to incorporate   the city of Kirkuk<a name="tx13"></a><a href="#nt13"><sup>13</sup></a> and adjacent areas under its control. Turkey fears that   Kurdish control of Kirkuk's oil wealth would enable the Kurds to create an   independent state (Larrabee: 2008, 7-11).<a name="tx14"></a><a href="#nt14"><sup>14</sup></a> Turkey wants Iraq to remain whole,   but it realizes that if tensions in Iraq devolve into all-out violence and   the country breaks apart, Turkey would be better off with a friendly partner   in Iraq's energy-rich north. In October, Turkey and Iraq took a giant step   forward to boost ties, signing more than 40 agreements. The deals were signed   at a meeting of the key government ministers of the two countries under the   High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (Kene, 2009). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Recently, the Turkish government, has undertaken a number of potentially significant   measures in a search for a solution to the country's long-standing "Kurdish   problem" (Ramonet, 2004) and to cement Turkey's expanding ties with the   Kurdish administration in northern Iraq. For decades, Kurdish nationalists   have demanded that Turkey end forceful assimilations and denial of even basic   rights of Kurds and recognise their legitimate cultural rights by creating   a dual educational system where classes are held in both Turkish and Kurdish.<a name="tx15"></a><a href="#nt15"><sup>15</sup></a>  The AKP aims to resolve the question by granting some basic individual and   cultural rights to the millions of Kurds. The AK has reversed decades of official   policy by trying to meet the demands of Turkey's large Kurdish minority (some 14 million in a total population of 72 million). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The initiative called "Kurdish opening" was a welcoming development:   it envisaged bringing members of the PKK back to Turkey from the organization's   bases in Iraq and cells in Europe through an unofficial amnesty. The return   of the 12,000 refugees in the UN-run camp at Makhmour, in northern Iraq, is   part of the Turkish government's plan to broaden freedoms for its Kurdish community   and secure an end to the 25-year violence by separatist Kurdish rebels, inside   and on Turkey's borders. It is also a calculated political move to cement Turkey's   expanding ties with the Kurdish administration in northern Iraq. Iraq's Kurds,   despite age-old tensions with Turkey, have also warmed their relations as trade   has boomed and the looming departure of the US troops, the Kurds' protectors,   raises the spectre of isolation. Unfortunately, the government has since backed   down, calling off its plan to bring more PKK members back to Turkey, when a   group of them, whom the Turkish government had allowed into the country from   Iraq, delivered fiery speeches in support of the terrorist group (Cagaptay, 2009a).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkey is opposed to isolating Iran and Syria or overthrowing the regimes   in either country. Rather, Ankara favors policies aimed at engaging Iran and   Syria and to encourage the United States to open dialogues with both countries.   Erdogan's government is strongly opposed to a military strike against Tehran,   which it believes could further destabilise the region. Turkey's interest in   good relations with Iran and Syria is in line with the European positions (Larrabee:   2008, 4). However, Turkey's outreaching should not be seen as undermining attempts   to pressure Iran or as giving cover to Syria's maverick behavior. During Prime   Minister Erdogan's visit to Tehran, he stressed Iran's right to nuclear power   for civil purposes, pointedly congratulated Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,   after his disputed election win in June (Uslu, 2009). He further said that   countries opposed to Iran's atomic program should give up their own nuclear   weapons and defines as 'arrogant' the sanctions imposed on Tehran. These declarations   threaten to stir fresh tensions between Turkey and the EU, after Turkish leaders   provoked a crisis in relations with Israel by banning it from participating   in joint military exercises. Turkey and Syria, two former enemies, have also   mended relations in late 2009 (Haddad, 2009). Relations have improved swiftly   after decades of mistrust based on Ankara's accusations that Damascus supported   Turkey's banned Kurdistan Workers' Party. Turkey boosted its ties with Syria   with a newly formed cooperation council. The new cooperation agenda called   for a series of meetings between respective ministers and the signing of diplomatic   and economic agreements (Al Jazeera, 2009).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rather than seeing Turkey's ties to Tehran and Damascus as a problem, Europe   should view them as an asset. The EU might spur Turkey to find a way to play   a bridge- building role between Iran and the international community in order   to end Tehran's nuclear ambitions. As Turkey increases its relationships with   states like Iran and Syria, which the United States and the EU, to a lesser   extent, regard as destabilizing elements in the region, Ankara's value to the   EU may increase further it it becomes a player in European-Middle Eastern rapprochement.   In fact, supporters of the AKP's new foreign policy argue that "Turkey   is finally finding its voice in international politics" (Abramowitz e   Barkey: 2009, 5).    It should go without saying that Turkish assertion should not undermine Turkey's   EU membership bid, nor jeopardize its credibility and the positive role it can play in the broader region.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One relevant aspect, involves Turkey's relationship with Israel. Since 1993,   Turkey has been engaged in extensive cooperation with Israel, formalised in   a range of agreements stretching from cultural to military matters. The initiation   of the Middle East peace process and the signing of the Oslo Agreement in 1993   created a conducive environment for the enhancement of relations between the   two countries. In 1996, the signing of the defense and co-operation agreement   signalled the emergence of new strategic co-operation. The agreements on military   cooperation brought Turkey and Israel together as true security partners in   the Middle East. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While relations in military co-operation, trade, and tourism flourished, this   new partnership proved to be mutually beneficial. In 2007, in the wake of the   Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert's visit to Turkey, Ankara started mediating   the Israeli-Syrian indirect peace talks. The 2008 Gaza offensive led to the   disruption of indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria. The offensive&#32;&#150;&#32;which   killed hundreds of civilians besides Hamas members&#32;&#150;&#32;and ongoing turmoil in   the Palestinian enclave contributed to Turkey's decision to freeze relations   with Israel.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, the escalating tensions in the Arab-Israeli conflict and the crisis   in Lebanon during the summer of 2006 have adversely affected the relations,   by negatively influencing Turkish public opinion towards Israel. Under the   current AKP government, the dynamics have started to change somewhat. Ties   have frayed as Turkish public opinion, which now counts for more, has turned   increasingly hostile to Israel. The bloodshed in Gaza outraged many Turks,   who praised Erdogan when he stormed out of a debate with Israel's president,   Shimon Peres, stormed out of the world economic forum in Davos, Switzerland   after a heated debate with Shimon Peres on Gaza,    earlier this year. In February, Turkey hosted leaders of the militant Palestinian   Islamist group Hamas, a visit that outraged Israel and the United States and   dismayed the EU and some Turkish political circles. In an interview with <I>The   Washington Post</I>, Erdogan called for recognition of Hamas which won a landslide   victory in Palestinian elections in 2006. He said isolating Hamas is the reason   for the ongoing tensions in the region (PressTV, 2009). In early October, Turkey   disinvited Israel from Anatolian Eagle, an annual Turkish air force exercise   that it had held with Israel, NATO, and the United States since the mid-1990s.    A day after it dismissed Israel, Turkey invited Syria to joint military exercises   and announced the creation of a Strategic Cooperation Council with Damascus.    As Cagaptay has pointed out, "Turkish-Israeli ties&#32;&#150;&#32;long a model for   how a Muslim country can pursue a rational, cooperative relationship with the Jewish state&#32;&#150;&#32;will continue to unravel" (Cagaptay, 2009).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another important development is that recently Turkey has begun playing a   new role in the Middle East: that of mediator. Turkey was one of the countries,   together with Qatar, that mediated an agreement between the U.S.-backed ruling   coalition and the Hezbollah-led opposition alliance in Lebanon's presidential   election process. It is mediating Iraq and Syria's recent dispute.   Iraq and Syria are entangled in a diplomatic dispute over demands that Damascus   extradite two suspects wanted in suicide attacks in Baghdad. Iraq says Syria   has been used as a launching pad for violence in Iraq (AP, 2009). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Drawing on its growing closeness to Iran, Syria and Iraq, Turkey is working   to position itself as a key regional mediator in the Middle East. Turkey's   bid might be part of a larger plan to improve its relations with neighbors   and take full advantage of its location and historical ties. Ankara is poising   to play a larger role than it has in previous decades. As the relations between   Turkey and the European Union follow an uneven course, Turkish foreign policy   trends have demonstrated a strategic shift toward the Middle East. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>Turkey: poised between East and West</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkish membership of the European Union has a variety of political implications.   Turkey's contribution to the EU's security and defense policy would bring numerous   benefits through Turkey's military capabilities and the positive role it could   play in its neighboring vicinity: the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Caspian area   and the Middle East. Turkey's military capabilities are vital for operations   in the expanded European security area. Its ability to affect EU operations   through its vote in NATO's Atlantic Council cannot be underestimated.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkey's strategic geographical location, its large Muslim population and   assets make it an important powerful player and will add to the already complex   set of alliances and foreign policy combinations that are possible. Turkey's   entry to the EU will shift the Union's borders to the southeast and increase   the Union's range of interests in these complex regions. The main immediate   threats to European security come from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan,   areas adjacent to Turkey. The EU's fight against the proliferation of WMD,   terrorism and drug trafficking, will have to include Turkey diplomatic ties   and experience with those problems.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With the Turkish neighborhood extending deeper into the southeastern periphery,   the EU and Turkey may have convergent interests in some of the neighboring   regions, but there are equally a number of areas where interests may part.   Overall, one may argue EU and Turkey are foreign policy actors with several   affinities, as far as the Middle East agenda is concerned. The Turkish Foreign   Minister has argued that Turkish foreign policy had been unbalanced, with an   overemphasis on ties with Western Europe and the United States to the neglect   of Turkey's interests with other countries, particularly in the Middle East   (Taspinar: 2008, 14). This diversification, as Larrabee points out, "is   on the whole healthy, and should be no cause for alarm. On the contrary, Ankara's   strong ties to the Middle East can be an asset for the West as Turkey can serve   as a bridge to the Middle East. But to play this role Turkey needs to maintain a firm anchor to the West&#32;&#150;&#32;and above all to Europe" (Larrabee, 2009).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkey is working to position itself as a key regional partner, mediator and   interlocutor in the Middle East and is in line with the AKP's "neo-Ottomanism" philosophy.   Turkey's bid is part of a larger plan to improve its relations with neighbours   and take full advantage of its location and historical ties. Ankara is poising   to play a larger role than it has in previous decades. Turkey's policy focus   is somewhat more multi-regional in focus than before (Ferguson: 2007, 3). It   is already now playing a new role as mediator and powerbroker in the Middle   East, namely in Lebanon, Israel, Syria and Iraq. Turkey's multidimensional   foreign policy (Abramowitz and Barkey: 2009, 5), does not preclude the maintenance   of the EU and the United States as key partners in Turkey's new Eurasian roles   (Ferguson: 2007, 3) Given its location, Turkey has strong regional interests,   but they not translate automatically into a pretension to be a major player   on all its areas of vicinity. It has turned its face toward the Middle East   and Arab countries, although, as of yet, there is not a clear vision of Turkey's real influence in the region. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a close neighbor with historical ties to the region, Turkey can act as   a useful interlocutor, especially at a time when U.S. ties to Iran and Syria   are strained. Rather than a "bridge" or a "buffer zone",   some analysts suggest that Turkey can and would act to some extent as an interpreter   or translator for the EU with the Middle East, in the sense that it could advocate   EU's interests in the region. Turkey could play a leading role in resolving   political conflicts; boosting economic cooperation and investment within the   region; and supporting political, economic, and social reforms. As the most   democratic Muslim country in the Middle East, one with rich experience dealing   with and adapting to Western institutions, Turkey is the best-suited Middle   Eastern country to lead the effort to advance regional stability and development.   Advocates of of Turkey's membership in the EU say the EU and the international   community should support Turkey in this role. Turkey's growing political ties   with Iran are an asset for the EU as it seeks to expand its influence and to   find a diplomatic solution to the international stand-off over Iran's nuclear   program. The access of AKP leaders to Iranian leaders, should strengthen the   arguments that Turkey is in a position to persuade the Iranian leaders not   to defy the demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency and risk international   sanctions and reproval. The improvements in the Turkey-Syria relationship takes   place as the EU is negotiating an Association Agreement with Damascus and amidst   a great interest the Syrians have demonstrated in getting closer to the EU.   Turkey and the EU should work together closely to draw Syria into a wider net   of international cooperation and reciprocal obligations. Damascus sorely needs   to break its diplomatic isolation. The EU can offer trade, know-how, technology,   and investment, all of which the Syrian enconomy is in desperate need. Turkey's   relatively constructive relationship with Israel, although undergoing a thawing,   could benefit the EU. As far as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is concerned,   Brussels and Ankara share the same objectives&#32;&#150;&#32;a similar vision of a two-state   solution&#32;&#150;&#32;and could complement their relative diplomatic clout to intervene   with the participants. The EU and Turkey could work together fruitfully on   Israel-Palestine trying to break the deadlock in the peace process (Everts: 2004, 5-7).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">During President Obama's visit to Ankara, he signaled Washington's support   for Turkey's entry in the EU and for Turkey's role in the Middle East. Turkey's   growing influence in the Middle East can be a sure way of enhancing its asset   value for the EU and facilitating Turkey's European bid. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkey could indeed perform that role, but to an extent that should not be   overestimated. Turkish efforts over the last two years to mediate between Syria   and Israel, the Lebanese groups, and, more recently, Palestinian organizations &#150;,   as well as its offer to mediate between Iran and the United States on the nuclear   issue&#32;&#150;&#32;have met with limited success so far. The AKP's more recent clumsy   foreign policy initiatives shows it apparently wants to boost ties with the   Islamic world even at the risk of undermining Ankara's traditional alliances.   The freezing of relations with Israel, the championing of Iranian-backed Hamas,   a militant group shunned by Israel and the West, are examples of moves that   could damage Turkey's international standing and its EU candidacy. Many analysts   also see in Ankara's hectic foreign policy bridge-building, the signs that   the AKP wants to remould Turkey's foreign policy along more Islamist lines.   The AKP's rise to power is the reflection of the revival of Islamic feeling   in Turkey after decades of enforced secularism, a trend which has swept the   neighboring Muslim region. Skeptics usually focus on AKP's Muslim political   background and tend to see a hidden Islamic agenda behind openings to the Arab   world. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other hand, it must be said that Turkey's mediating role will always   be limited by Turkey's inability to legitimately represent the Arab world.   The Turkish Republic is the culmination of a very particular historical development   and it is not clear that Turkish accession to the EU would be seen as an example   to follow by other Islamic countries (especially in the Arab world), which   cope differently with the twin challenges of democratic change and assimilating   the role of Islam in society. The strict secular nature of the Turkish Republic's   political system, puts it in a special position as far as its Muslim neighbors   are concerned. Moreover, unlike any other country in the region, Turkey has   a long-standing relation with the West: institutionally through NATO and to   a certain extent, already wih the EU, apart from a special link to the US and   privileged relationships with other states. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Turkish officials have been careful to explain that their renewed interest   in the Muslim East does not mean a chill towards the West. They argue that   such an Islamic agenda simply does not exist, mainly on the grounds that the   AKP is the most pro-European Union political party on the Turkish scene. Yet,   is cannot be ruled out that such an equidistance could change if Turkey's prospects   for joining the EU die. It is obvious that Turkey considers herself as a European   state and aims to be an equal and a major state within the EU (Ferguson: 2007,   3). For this reason, the basic and stable characteristic of Turkish foreign   policy is its tendency towards the West, as demonstrated by the early alliance   with NATO and the associate membership in the European Economic Community back   in the 1950s. What the trends analysed in this article portend is that Ankara   is now poised to embrace the West as much as the Islamic world. That means   that Turkey will pursue its EU endeavour, without giving up her intentions   to play a more independent and self-interested Middle Eastern role.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>Bibliography</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="verdana"><b>Primary sources</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Council of the European Union. 2008.

It was   enlarged several times. When the European Union (EU) was created in 1993, the   EEC became one of the EU's three pillars.    <br> <a name="nt02"></a><a href="#tx02">2</a> Little more than a year later, the EU suspended the talks in a slew of accession   dossiers, due to the rift caused by the Cyprus issue. The EU de-coupled the   question of Cypriot accession from a settlement on the status of the island's   northern third. However, it also underscored the fact that Turkey's own entry   would unavoidably be conditional on resolution of its bilateral disputes with   Greece. In December 2006, the EU Council voted to suspend eight out of 35 chapters   in the access negotiations, freezing the formal progress on chapters directly   connected with the bloc's customs union, as Turkey had failed to follow its   rules and open its ports and airspace to Greek Cypriots. Turkey had committed   under the 2004 Ankara Protocol to opening its ports and airports to Cyprus. These   obligations were later incorporated into Turkey's negotiating framework   for EU accession, making them an integral part of Ankara's EU bid. Since   then, Cyprus has informally blocked several other chapters. Ankara argued it   was not prepared to change its position on Cyprus if the EU does not fulfill   its commitment to ease the isolation of Turkish Cypriots in the north of the   island. Turks were referring to a political pledge made by the EU after Turkish   Cypriots supported a UN plan on the unification of the island in 2004, which   Greek Cypriots rejected. Greek, not Turkish Cypriots, vetoed the island's unification   The Turks say the EU should never have admitted a divided Cyprus after the   Greek Cypriots rejection of the UN peace plan. The cooling of political attitudes   towards Turkey is also fuelled by public fears of immigration and suspicion   towards Islam. The EU also says that Turkey's efforts to bring its laws into   line with European standards (the so-caled "Copenhagen criteria")   have slowed down. Until recently EU officials talked about possible Turkish   membership in 10 to 15 years. The Portuguese European Commission President,   Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, subsequently used the phrase "15 to 20 years" (BBC,   2006).    <br> <a name="nt03"></a><a href="#tx03">3</a> The Helsinki Headline Goal was a military capability target set for 2003   during the December 1999 Helsinki European Council meeting, defined as the   autonomous ability to deploy 60,000 troops in 60 days for an operation lasting   as long as one year to conduct the "Petersberg Tasks" of humanitarian   intervention, peacekeeping, and peacemaking. From the Petersburg task scenarios   envisaged, the EU generated the "Helsinki Headline Catalogue" which   specifies which capabilities are required in each of 144 capability areas.   As the Helsinki Headline Goal became fulfilled, the European Council of June   2004 approved to further develop the EU's military crisis management capability   and a new target was set: the "Headline Goal 2010". Capabilities   needed for upper level tasks, such as strategic airlift, will take several   years to develop and acquire.    <br> <a name="nt04"></a><a href="#tx04">4</a> The so-called "Berlin Plus" agreement provides the basis for NATO-EU   cooperation in crisis management operations, by allowing the EU to have access   to NATO's collective assets and capabilities for EU-led operations, including   command arrangements and assistance in operational planning. In effect, they   allow the Alliance to support EU-led operations in which NATO as a whole is   not engaged.    <br> <a name="nt05"></a><a href="#tx05">5</a> Turkey does not recognize the Greek Cypriot-led government on the divided   island of Cyprus and maintains 35,000 troops in the Turkish Republic of Northern   Cyprus (KKTC).    <br> <a name="nt06"></a><a href="#tx06">6</a> The Western European Union (WEU) is a European defence and security organisation,   established to implement the Treaty of Brussels (1948). Its main feature was   the commitment to mutual defence should any of the signatories be the victim   of an armed attack in Europe. The organisation was surpassed by the creation   of NATO in 1949. On 13 November 2000, WEU Ministers met in Marseille and agreed   to begin transferring the organisation's capabilities and functions to the   European Union, under its developing Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)   and European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). With the entry into force   of the Treaty of Lisbon, later this year, it is expected that WEU members will   decide to scrap the organisation altogether.    <br> <a name="nt07"></a><a href="#tx07">7</a> Concerning non-Article 5 activities, the common defense clause.    <br> <a name="nt08"></a><a href="#tx08">8</a> The St. Malo Declaration said that the European Union ought to have the capability   for "autonomous action backed up by credible military forces" as   part of a common defence policy. It laid the political foundation between France   and the Great Britain for the creation of a EU military force, which in turn   facilitated the launch of the European Security and Defence Policy.    <br> <a name="nt09"></a><a href="#tx09">9</a> He expressed his opposition to <I>Turkey's </I>EU membership bid.    <br> <a name="nt10"></a><a href="#tx10">10</a> Azerbaijan has vehemently protested against the agreement, insisting that   the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh must be resolved first. Armenia has controlled   Nagorno-Karabakh, which lies wholly within Azerbaijan, since a war was fought   over the landlocked region between 1988 and 1994. A ceasefire brokered by Russia   has held since 1994. After signing the agrrement, Turkey's Prime Minister Erdogan   said that Armenia must withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan to assure   his parliament's approval for the agreement, an assertion which may undermine   the chance to resolve the crisis.    <br> <a name="nt11"></a><a href="#tx11">11</a> The first was 2002-2007. The AKP won a second mandate in the July 2007 elections   with 46.6% of the vote.    <br> <a name="nt12"></a><a href="#tx12">12</a> The PKK, the Kurdistan Workers' Party is a separatist militant organization.   The group was founded in the late 1970s and it aims to create an independent,   Kurdish state in Turkey. Kurdistan is a widgeographical region that comprises   parts of southeastern Turkey, northeastern Iraq, northeastern Syria and northwestern   Iran, where Kurds are the majority. The PKK is listed as a terrorist organization   internationally by a number of states and organizations, including the United   States, United Nations, NATO and the European   Union.    <br> <a name="nt13"></a><a href="#tx13">13</a> Kirkuk is a city in northeastern Iraq. It is the centre of the northern Iraqi   petroleum industry. It is an historically and ethnically mixed city populated   by mostly Kurds, Assyrians, Turkmen and Arabs. Kirkuk's citizens&#32;&#150;&#32;specifically   its Kurds and Turkomen&#32;&#150;&#32;were victims of an ethnic cleansing, expulsion, and 'Arabization' campaign   carried out by the Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein during three and a half   decades of absolute rule. The status of Kirkuk is a critical issue for Iraq's   post-Saddam constitutional democracy. The process for resolving this status   is set in Article 140 of the Iraq Constitution: it calls for the normalization   of Kirkuk's status, including the proper restoration of its pre-1968 boundaries,   to be followed by a referendum on its unification with the Kurdistan Regional   Government (KRG). The Kirkuk referendum is the Kirkuk part of a plebiscite   that will decide whether the Kurdish regions within Iraqi governorates will   become part of the Iraqi Kurdistan region. The referendum was initially planned   for 15 November 2007, but has been delayed.    <br> <a name="nt14"></a><a href="#tx14">14</a> Larrabee's study.    <br> <a name="nt15"></a><a href="#tx15">15</a> The Kurdish language had long been banned in Turkey, and in 1967 the government   officially outlawed publishing books and other types of printed material in   Kurdish. It also made it illegal to record, sing or otherwise disseminate Kurdish   songs and music. It was only during the presidency of Turgut Ozal in the early   1990s that the Turkish government acknowledged the Kurdish language as an important component of the country's Kurdish identity.</font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

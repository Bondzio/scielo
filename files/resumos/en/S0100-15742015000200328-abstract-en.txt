In order to surround the construct "social subjectivity" and contribute with a conceptual element, which favours what Tedesco (2004) termed "subjectivity polices", this paper shows both theoretical and empirical efforts, in discussing issues related to teacher's professionalization. The debate begins showing elements that brought the investigated construct closer. With the aim to articulate teacher's social subjectivity and professionalization, the paper also intended to show how the research results has fed the analyses and has contributed to define more precisely the contours of the construct that the academic literature still presenting in a diffuse way. In this both efforts, the study tried to put in evidence that a psychosocial approach of social representations allows the construction of an interdisciplinary perspective of education.

Abstract: This paper seeks to analyze the relationship between the police and prosecutors in Brazil and France, through the comparison of two field surveys, contrasting their data. In Brazil, it is a field research on the organization of work in the office at the Prosecutor's Office of the State of Rio de Janeiro. The other research was the observation of criminal hearings in different forums of the French southeast. So we seek to understand how these institutions have different meanings in these countries: transparency and cooperation in the administration of justice produce trust between the actors in the French case whereas the opacity of the forms of production of opinions and institutional dispute for control over the facts characterized this relationship in the Brazilian case.

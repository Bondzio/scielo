The purpose of this paper is to study the degree of success and failure of Federation of Parana State Industry (Fiep) on the proposals submitted at the 16th Legislature (2007-2011) of the Legislative Assembly of Parana. To materialize this purpose, we analyze the convergence rate between the suggestions of Industry Federation of Paran√° and the propositions that were processed during the legislature, drawing on the methodology developed by Mancuso (2007) for the analysis of parliamentary action of entrepreneurs. We seek to demonstrate two basis hypothesis: (i) the degree of success of the entrepreneurs of Parana State is smaller than that observed by other authors in Federal Legislature, (ii) the businessmen of Parana State are characterized as a political actor with a low degree of purposeful but with high power veto over the propositions that contradict their interests. Thus, we seek to enter into the debate about the political entrepreneurial action in the post-1988 brazilian political system, highlighting some of its uniqueness and innovative ways of collective action at regional scale.

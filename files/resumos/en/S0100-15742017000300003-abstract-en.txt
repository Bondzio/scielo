ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to discuss the conceptions of exact science faculty members in relation to the implementation and maintenance of affirmative actions in higher education. Data were produced through interviews with faculty and managers in mathematics and engineering courses, and were organized and analysed using content analysis from the theoretical perspective of critical inquiry. For analysing the data, we used content analysis&#8217; analytical tools, having critical inquiry as theoretical perspective. Results can be summarized in four themes: assistentialism; affirmative action students&#8217; singularities, particularities and academic achievement; the permanence issue; and the value given to teachers involved in practices aimed at promoting the permanence of students who were the beneficiaries of affirmative action.

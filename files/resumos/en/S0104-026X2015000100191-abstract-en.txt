This article contextualizes chicana cyberart in the decolonial conception of the region of Aztl&#225;n, confirming clearly that "Latin America is not entirely in the territory which carries its name" (CANCLINI, 2008). This 'territorial' appropriation is also temporal: it is performative of decolonial temporality as it dethrones the colonialist regime of chrononormativity which disqualifies non-eurocentric epistemes by mapping them onto the past. Specifically, the article addresses how chicana cyberart decolonizes temporality by refusing the transcendentalist or post-social version of the cyborg narrative. Discussing specific ways in which chicana cyberart queers the chrononormative prescription of the future as high technology over the past as its low-tech residue, the article affirms Afrofuturism's broader conception of technology (which acknowledges its residue as its own suppressed supplement) as an effective threat to the chronic biopolitics of straight temporality.

This article touches upon the feeding routine within daycare institutions; the data was collected via an ethnographic approach. The results reveal that feeding times fall within a context in which the body is the primary aspect of disciplinary processes, directed at civilizing and controlling the conduct of each individual based on an over-emphasized, biological impulse of survival to maintain the body's "healthiness". This belief sees the human body as merely a biological instrument of the natural act of consumption.

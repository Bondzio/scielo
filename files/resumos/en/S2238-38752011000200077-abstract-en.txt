Abstract: In D. Quixote in America, Anne-Christine Taylor addresses the paradox of Lévi-Strauss' Americanist identity. The general and abstract range of Lévi-Strauss' work and the little theoretical and empirical expressivity of Americanism at the time of his first and short field experiences could suggest that the region where the author became an anthropologist had no influence on the theoretical development of his work. The paper shows, on the contrary, that if he became Americanist almost by chance, the influence of Amerindian experience and thought over the structuralism of Lévi-Strauss was such that one can speak of an "Indianization" of his scientific imaginary even when his goal is the universal.

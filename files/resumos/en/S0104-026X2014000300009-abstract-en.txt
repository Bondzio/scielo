The article unfolds from a survey conducted with managers and technicians related to municipal secretariats involved with the implementation of policies and programs of social inclusion, in a city of the Metropolitan area of Porto Alegre/RS. From the perspective of gender studies and post&#45;structuralist cultural studies, we discuss a movement of genderification that we have named "feminization of social inclusion", focusing on the employment situation and working conditions, the infrastructure of services and the ways in which professionals/technicians perceive themselves on the implementation of policies. We argue that promoting social inclusion presupposes to develop and play a set of capabilities represented as being from 'the order of the feminine', that are constitutive of the feminization incorporated and made by policies.

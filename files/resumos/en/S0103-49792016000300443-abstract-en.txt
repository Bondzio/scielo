The objective of this reflection is to comprehend the transformation of the dynamic of the process of internationalization of the globalization using as a theme the gastronomy. This theme is thought as a cultural field (Bourdieu) and using as clippings the chefs, the restaurants and the gastronomic guides analyzed under the sociohistorical perspective. Considering the balance between the penetration of the gastronomic culture in contexts more apart from each other, besides being diverse among themselves, the proposal of this article is to discuss how the consolidation of a gastronomic global market is in contrast with the continuous exercises of affirming the localities and the particular identities.

The objective of this study was to measure the technical efficiency of 228 plots of coffee from the regions of the Brazilian Savannas (Cerrado) and South of Minas Gerais and to identify the determining factors of that efficiency, considering irrigated and non-irrigated crops. The analyses were carried out using both Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and an econometric Tobit model. The results show that most of the coffee crops present technical inefficiency and among the most inefficient are the non-irrigated crops.

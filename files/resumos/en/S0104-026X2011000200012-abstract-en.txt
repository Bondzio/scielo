This paper aims to analyze the way in which gender is related with physical educations class. This analysis was based on answers to open-ended questions by state school teachers from the metropolitan area of Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo in 2009. The analysis contemplated two main points: the curriculum design and class content selected by the teachers; open and hidden conflicts. The teacher's views about gender showed to be varied and only some of them consider sex difference in curriculum design. Differences in the performance of boys and girls appear as the main source of conflicts. Mixed classes were seen to contribute for eliminating stereotypical views of femininity and masculinity and for showing that not all boys prefer team sports and that girls enjoy playing them as well.

This article is based on fieldwork among the Awa-Guaj&#225; people, a small indigenous group of Tup&#237;-Guaran&#237; speakers inhabiting the eastern portion of Brazil's Amazon region. Aiming for an ethnographic definition of kinship, this article engages in issues related to the figure of the "owners" in the Amazon, proposing a dialogue with a seldom discussed aspect of this subject, namely, its relation to conjugality. I argue that relationships included in the universe of "familiarity" and "mastery" are not only coextensive with the field of kinship; they also reveal a very particular conception of conjugality. The process of Aw&#225;-Guaj&#225; kinship, where the spouse is transformed through a very particular system of actions, can only be understood if we move beyond the issue of Amazonian affinity, and articulate it with certain aspects of the familiarity and mastery theme

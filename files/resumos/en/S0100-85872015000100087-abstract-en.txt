Abstract In this article, I analyze the space created by the social projects of Catholic entity Venerable Third Order of St. Francis of Penance (VOT) during the reurbanization of Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s port region. Discursively attuned to government actions to combat the supposed degradation and misuses of the region, the Franciscans have proposed the salvation of his &#8220;marginalized population&#8221;. Moreover, after the removal of former residents, they converted several houses in examples of &#8220;beauty, cleanliness, order and protection&#8221; to shelter their schools and professionalizing courses, promoting a &#8220;school community&#8221; that was contested by other inhabitants with different notions of materiality and morality.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nationalism has been on the rise in Latin America    during the last few years. Nationalizations of energy resources in Evo Morales’    Bolivia and the fiery anti-American and anti-imperialist rhetoric of Venezuela’s    president Hugo Ch&aacute;vez are the most notable examples of this tendency.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Brazil, a number of analysts of the country’s    foreign relations see this development as highly problematic and have argued    that it may well lead to a crisis of Mercosur. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been argued that even though it seems    plausible that leftist governments in South America will have a propensity to    support South American regionalism politically there is a possible structural    conflict involved in the cooperation between South American governments headed    by the political left and the nationalist developmental ideology and policies    that characterize this type of government.<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><sup>1</sup></a>    Others have argued that, contrary to the Brazilian government’s upbeat rhetoric    about the success of Mercosur and South American regional integration, Mercosur    is actually facing a crisis.<a name="tx02"></a><a href="#nt02"><sup>2</sup></a>    Inside Brazil, the government’s regional policy has created strong controversy.    Critics find that the Brazilian policy towards countries such as Bolivia, Argentina    and Venezuela is costly and based more on the government’s ideological position    on the political left than on a rational approach to defending the national    interest. The ideological position is seen as hurting Brazil’s relations to    the United States<a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><sup>3</sup></a> and potentially    as a threat to Mercosur’s cohesion.<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><sup>4</sup></a>    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The question raised in this paper is therefore    if the new nationalist turn in South America will get in the way of regional    integration? In the analysis I emphasize Brazil’s relations to the other Mercosur    members and to Bolivia that may soon become a member of Mercosur. The wider    South American integration project is also brought into the analysis.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The reason for the focus on Brazil is that it    is the most powerful member in Mercosur. It has a GDP that represents more than    50% of total South American GDP, a population and a territory about half the    regional total.<a name="tx05"></a><a href="#nt05"><sup>5</sup></a> Brazil is    furthermore actively promoting a regional leadership role for the country and    also sees this as away to gain a more prominent role in the world.<a name="tx06"></a><a href="#nt06"><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Conceptual clarification</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The concept of nationalism is used in a conventional    fashion in the present analysis, i.e. as a strong inclination towards jealously    guarding national autonomy and taking actions that fall short of a cooperative    attitude towards foreign actors, e.g. by nationalizing private companies. In    this way it is possible to distinguish governments on a scale from very nationalist    to internationalist. Used in this way, nationalism is often considered a negative    force. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nationalism can also be understood in another    much broader sense denoting a predisposition to defend the national interest.    This is less controversial. In fact, it is widely seen as what one should expect    from one’s government. From this view it is obvious that when a country joins    a regional grouping it does so exactly to defend the national interest.<a name="tx07"></a><a href="#nt07"><sup>7</sup></a>    The nationalist interest can be pursued in very different ways, however, either    by pursuing strongly nationalist policies or more internationalist policies    of integration in the global economy. Understood in this way, nationalism is    a complex theme. It is a complex and ambiguous task to define national interests    and since the definition of the national interest is permanently contested,    but a state and its people are the only ones who can defend national interests    in the international sphere. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">How then is the national interest defined? There    are two ways of accounting for this process. One approach emphasizes state autonomy    arguing that political elites define national interests. The second perspective    argues that the definition of the national interest, although it is formulated    at the level of political elites, ultimately depends on the constellation of    social forces in society and on perceptions of how national interests are best    defended in a context of globalization. This position builds on a relational    theory of the state.<a name="tx08"></a><a href="#nt08"><sup>8</sup></a> The    analysis developed in this article takes the last position. In practice the    approach taken is to emphasize ideas at the level of political elites while    taking into consideration the social and political context in which policy making    elites develop and implement their strategies.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Context and background</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The recent interest in nationalism in Latin America    runs parallel to the interest in Latin America’s recent turn to the political    left. In recent years leftist governments have won elections in most of South    America. This fact has implications for their development strategies and therefore    also for South American regional integration. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a tendency amongst analysts to divide    these leftist governments into two different types. One type is exemplified    by the Brazilian government led by the Workers’ Party (PT) and Lula or the Chilean    government. This type is considered as pragmatic, sensible and realist. It has    moderated the traditional anti-Americanism of the Latin American left wing and    focuses instead on substance and the achievement of concrete development results.    The other type is exemplified by the Bolivian government of Evo Morales and    the Venezuelan government of Hugo Ch&aacute;vez.. Casta&ntilde;eda argues that    this type of leftist government has roots in populist or nationalistic parties    and movements and is characterized by an aggressive rhetoric against the United    States. According to Casta&ntilde;eda the leaders in this type of government    focus more on gaining power and on populist rhetoric than on the achievement    of concrete development results.<a name="tx09"></a><a href="#nt09"><sup>9</sup></a>    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This dualist approach seems overly one-sided    and un-nuanced. A more nuanced approach should not rule out that Casta&ntilde;eda’s    "bad left" may be successful in promoting development goals effectively.    It does not simply assume opportunistic motivations of leaders of the "bad    left" but instead focuses on partisan motivations. Finally, a more nuanced    approach should seek to explain why the left-wing governments in South America    take the concrete and varied forms that they do. One should look for answers    to this by looking at the historical background that led to the election of    leftist governments, and it is relevant to consider structural characteristics    of different national economies and of their international insertion when one    wants to explain the form taken by concrete governments. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is largely the emergence of the more radical    second type of leftist governments that has led to the sudden interest in nationalism    in Latin America. New left-wing governments with radical change-oriented agendas    have emerged. It is uncertain what economic model they aim at. Will they turn    into communist authoritarian states like Cuba, or are they moving towards some    other model? Will they have success or will they falter as predicted by Casta&ntilde;eda?    Recently, countries such as Venezuela and Argentina have had strong economic    growth while pursuing policies far from the neo-liberal model.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cuba and Venezuela have started ALBA, the Bolivarian    Alternative for the Americas and has been joined by Bolivia and Nicaragua after    left-wing governments won elections in these countries. ALBA is presented as    an alternative to US-sponsored neo-liberalism and to the Pan-American Free Trade    Area of the Americas (FTAA). According to ALBA’s internet site<a name="tx10"></a><a href="#nt10"><sup>10</sup></a>    ALBA is the people’s project in opposition to the FTAA that is the project of    capitalist elites and it emphasizes the need to reduce existing asymmetries    in Latin America. This is conceptualized with the concept of "cooperative    advantage" as a guiding principle in opposition to the principle of "comparative    advantage" defended by liberal economic theory. The current Brazilian government    with its national and global change agenda of "humanism and solidarity"<a name="tx11"></a><a href="#nt11"><sup>11</sup></a>    thus has elements in common with the ALBA project. However, its main objective    is to strengthen the unity of South America. Mexico’s entrance in NAFTA has    been important in Brazil’s strategy of creating a strong South America with    Brazil as a leading force. However, the overall strategy of the Brazilian government    is a kind of intermediate position on the scale from ALBA to FTAA (ALCA). It    pursues an intermediate strategy of "competitive advantage" and managed    globalization. An important expression of this is found in the formulation of    its industrial policy where the government points out seven sectors of strategic    importance to the Brazilian economy that should be supported actively through    state policies.<a name="tx12"></a><a href="#nt12"><sup>12</sup></a> Today the    ideal of liberalism has lost ground, and after the late 1990s with their financial    crises in the developing world a post-liberal agenda has gained pre-eminence    at the international level.<a name="tx13"></a><a href="#nt13"><sup>13</sup></a>    This tendency is clear in much of South America and also in Brazil. The model    that inspires Brazil today seems largely inspired by the successful development    experiences in China and much of Asia, particularly South-East Asia. These countries    have built their successful development models through strategic state involvement    in the economy<a name="tx14"></a><a href="#nt14"><sup>14</sup></a>, with an    emphasis on industrialization and international competitiveness. This has led    to the strengthening of beliefs in a more active and strategically oriented    state involvement in the economy and a state engaged in providing public goods.<a name="tx15"></a><a href="#nt15"><sup>15</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Why has there been a leftist turn in South    American politics in recent years?</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to explain this question it is useful    to briefly look at developments that preceded the shift.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the 1980s to early 1990s Latin American countries    embarked on liberal market-led reform. Neo-liberal reforms were however not    particularly successful in assuring sustainable development and several countries    faced major development crises again around the turn of the century. GDP stagnated    or fell and poverty and inequality rose in a context of financial crisis similar    to the context in which neo-liberal reforms had first been introduced. This    experience had an impact in perceptions of which development oriented policies    may be useful in the globalization context. Maybe neo-liberal policies of free    trade, financial deregulation, privatization and fiscal stringency were not    necessarily the right solution.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Argentina and Uruguay saw their GDP fall by almost    11% in 2002 alone<a name="tx16"></a><a href="#nt16"><sup>16</sup></a>. In Bolivia    the poverty rate was at 62.4% in 2002, and the percentage of poor was substantially    higher in the rural areas dominated by indigenous groups. Neo-liberal policies    in the period from 1985 to 2005 at the end of the day did not produce desired    results.<a name="tx17"></a><a href="#nt17"><sup>17</sup></a> In 2002, Brazil    faced stagnation and its risk rating rose to record high levels during the presidential    election in 2002 as financial investors worried about a possible victory of    the leftist PT led by Lula who criticized neo-liberal policies and the US vision    for the FTAA during his campaign.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time, development problems were on    the rise in a number of countries and fostered political instability. Paulo    Roberto de Almeida recently argued that the situation in a number of Andean    countries including Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru came close to being that of "<I>failed    states</I>"<a name="tx18"></a><a href="#nt18"><sup>18</sup></a>, that is    states with intense levels of social, economic and political instability and    low levels of development. A good example of such a state would be Iraq today,    but a number of African countries characterized by civil strife also fit the    definition. Liberalization and privatizations during the neo-liberal period    had failed to produce broadly shared development. In many cases foreign investors    controlled large parts of strategic natural resources as in the case of the    Bolivian and Venezuelan energy sector. A widespread perception took hold in    many South American countries that the neo-liberal model only favoured economic    elites. This led to different responses in different countries but also a general    trend of emphasizing poverty reduction, social inclusion and reducing social    inequality. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The shift in political orientation towards more    nationalist and more socially oriented policies was therefore basically provoked    by the unsuccessful development experiences associated with neo-liberal strategies.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is relevant when it comes to regional integration    in Mercosur and in South America more broadly. Ra&uacute;l Bernal-Meza<a name="tx19"></a><a href="#nt19"><sup>19</sup></a>    argues that the crisis experienced by Argentina in the first years of the new    millennium showed the defeat of neo-liberalism and called for a revision of    Mercosur’s nature and of the relationship between Argentina and Brazil. He further    argues that the situation faced by Argentina in 2002 should be seen as a crisis    of the state and its relations to society where more than 30% of the population    had entered the ranks of the extremely poor after 12 years of neo-liberal reforms.    Therefore, Bernal-Meza argues for a new model of national development and a    new direction in Mercosur towards a space for cooperation with solidarity in    which Argentina and Brazil should remain the strategic axis in a solid and unified    Mercosur with a common vision in external policy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This position was shared by Brazil. An expression    of this can be found in the Buenos Aires Consensus, in which Kirchner and Lula    express a common vision for Argentina and Brazil’s insertion in the global economy    and the principles that should guide development oriented policies inside the    countries and their external relations.<a name="tx20"></a><a href="#nt20"><sup>20</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the basis of this contextual background analysis    I shall now turn to the question addressed in this article<I>. Is nationalism    likely to get in the way of regional integration in Mercosur and in South America?</I>    </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Mercosur and South American integration in    the strategy of the Lula Government </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">From the outset it was clear that the Lula government    emphasized South American regionalism in its development strategy. In his inauguration    speech, Lula thus announced:</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The greatest priority of our foreign policy      during my government will be the building of a politically stable, prosperous      and united South America, founded upon the ideals of democracy and social      justice. To this end, decisive action is required to vitalize Mercosur….<a name="tx21"></a><a href="#nt21"><sup>21</sup></a></font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this way, Mercosur is seen as the column of    South American integration. The argument for a revitalized Mercosur and a more    socially just model seems in line with Ra&uacute;l Bernal-Meza’s call for changing    the nature of Mercosur by putting emphasis on cooperation with solidarity along    with the maintenance of Argentina and Brazil as the strategic axis. This vision    was shared by the Brazilian government.<a name="tx22"></a><a href="#nt22"><sup>22</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Prior to the election of Lula, Mercosur had gone    through its deepest crisis as the member countries went through severe economic    downturns that led to a drastic reduction in intra-Mercosur trade. After having    increased fast from Mercosur’s outset to 1998 where intra-regional trade reached    a record level of above US$ 20 billion, intra-regional trade lost steam as a    consequence of national crises, and by 2002 at the bottom of this trend it had    fallen to just above US$ 10 billion. From constituting 25.3% of total trade    in 1998, intra-Mercosur trade in 2002 was down at 11.4%<a name="tx23"></a><a href="#nt23"><sup>23</sup></a>    Clearly balance-of-payments problems and external financial vulnerability was    at the heart of this problem, but it led to a crisis of the common external    tariff and intra-Mercosur free trade rules. Particularly, Argentina broke rules,    sometimes unilaterally, creating conflict in the block and a growing number    of trade disputes. Most of the issues were sorted out at the end of 2002 when    the governments agreed on the Olivos Protocol on dispute settlement in Mercosur.<a name="tx24"></a><a href="#nt24"><sup>24</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In spite of the many problems affecting the Mercosur    countries and Mercosur’s model of integration, the block stayed intact. In fact,    one could even say that the crisis led to a stronger emphasis on Mercosur and    South American cooperation in the case of Argentina that had been very interested    in the US proposal of a Pan-American regional block during the Menem years (1989-1999).    In the case of the Lula government it defined Argentina as a prioritized strategic    partner and argued that the strong interdependence between South American countries    means that they share a common destiny and that they should seek to cooperate    closely with a view of strengthening democratic stability and economic development.    The argument is based on the idea that Brazil cannot develop in a good way if    its neighbours are affected by serious internal instability and crisis and that    South America, if it want to get a bigger say in international for a, should    unite. Even Brazil is not big enough on its own to gain a strong international    voice.<a name="tx25"></a><a href="#nt25"><sup>25</sup></a> The strategy of Brazil    is to gain a central regional role as a way to strengthen its development potential    and competitive insertion in the global economy and as a way to strengthen Brazil’s    political weight at the global level as South America’s leading country. It    is also a way to establish a sphere of influence of Brazil in South America    and to reduce the relative influence of the United States. In this respect,    Mercosur and FTAA are at the center of US-Brazilian relations and strategies    in the region.<a name="tx26"></a><a href="#nt26"><sup>26</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This emphasis on Mercosur is nothing new in Brazil    and South American cooperation also gained some emphasis during the Cardoso    government with its initiative of South American presidential summits and regional    energy and infrastructure integration in August 2000. South American regionalism    is widely accepted in Brazil at this shallow level of cooperation. However,    there are a number of differences regarding how it should be translated into    political practice and on how to judge the Lula government’s actual strategy    in the area. Has it been rational or ideological, has it produced good or bad    results and has it been balanced or characterized by a focus on cooperation    with other leftist governments?<a name="tx27"></a><a href="#nt27"><sup>27</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Critics find that there is a lack of consistency    in the many initiatives taken by the government. It has largely lost control    of the process and thus overestimated its capacity to be a regional leader.<a name="tx28"></a><a href="#nt28"><sup>28</sup></a>    Others find that regional integration is moving forward with the understandable    difficulties one should expect from such a process. Antonio Lassance thus argues    that South American integration is at an advanced stage in spite of the challenges    it poses.<a name="tx29"></a><a href="#nt29"><sup>29</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Samuel Pinheiro Guimar&atilde;es has argued    that one should expect considerable difficulties in the process of reaching    the goals set out in Lula’s inauguration speech since the regional environment    in South America is characterized by tensions and by political and economic    instability.<a name="tx30"></a><a href="#nt30"><sup>30</sup></a> Therefore,    Brazil needs to be patient and gradually work towards South American unity and    in doing so it must take a non-hegemonic attitude and introduce concrete and    effective instruments aimed at reducing asymmetries between Brazil and Argentina,    these two countries and Paraguay and Uruguay and finally between Mercosur and    the rest of South American countries.<a name="tx31"></a><a href="#nt31"><sup>31</sup></a>    The emphasis on asymmetries is important he argues because regional integration    first and foremost is a political process. It is therefore of pivotal importance    that outcomes of regional integration are perceived to be balanced.<a name="tx32"></a><a href="#nt32"><sup>32</sup></a>    The argument is based on the idea that governments join regional groupings in    order to pursue national interests. This argument is also defended in the present    analysis. In a similar vein it has been argued that the preservation and advancement    of political integration must be pushed forward by national logics that find    projection in the regional space, but that one should not assume that the strengthening    of a nationalist logic weakens the chances of supranational integration.<a name="tx33"></a><a href="#nt33"><sup>33</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the issue that shall be studied below.    I analyze Brazil’s relations to Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia and Venezuela and    draw in other relevant elements relevant to South American integration such    as the trade agreement between the Andes Community (CAN) and Mercosur, the construction    of the South American Community of Nations (CASA) and the recent South American    Energy Summit. The aim is thus to study Mercosur’s internal cohesion and expansion    as well as the wider project of South American unity. The Brazilian government’s    diplomacy is active at both levels and according to Amorim South American integration    is moving forward at two different speeds, a faster speed at the level of Mercosur    and a slower pace at the level of CASA.<a name="tx34"></a><a href="#nt34"><sup>34</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Uruguay</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Uruguay and Paraguay have been dissatisfied with    the way Mercosur has been moving forward. From 1998 when the member states’    economies started losing steam, the relative weight of Mercosur in Uruguay’s    export profile has also been reduced drastically from 60% in 1998 to 23% in    2006.<a name="tx35"></a><a href="#nt35"><sup>35</sup></a> In a letter to Lula    written on September 8’th 2006, Uruguay’s president Tabar&eacute; V&aacute;zquez    sets out by confirming that Mercosur is a priority for Uruguay but that there    are different problems in the block. He emphasizes that asymmetries between    the member countries have increased and points out that this has had serious    social and economic costs for Uruguay especially in terms of the loss of whole    industrial sectors in the economy. Based on this he calls for changes in Mercosur    that would respond to the needs and interests of the smaller members, amongst    this the right for the smaller members to make bilateral trade agreements with    the United States.<a name="tx36"></a><a href="#nt36"><sup>36</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Uruguay’s criticism of Mercosur and wish to make    a trade agreement with the United states created speculation about Uruguay’s    possible exit from Mercosur. Was it likely that Uruguay would leave Mercosur    and join the examples of Chile, Peru and Columbia that all have bilateral trade    agreements with the United States that are inspired by the principles contained    in NAFTA that the United states also defended for the FTAA? </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There were other reasons why such an outcome    was not unlikely. Rios and Veiga point out that Uruguay’s dissatisfaction also    stems from the bilateral conflict between Argentina and Uruguay over the instalment    of two cellulose factories close to the Rio Uruguay and the common border. Brazil    and Argentina were also perceived to emphasize their bilateral relations and    not paying enough attention to the interests of the smaller countries.<a name="tx37"></a><a href="#nt37"><sup>37</sup></a>    In other words, there was not enough attention in the big countries at assuring    a balanced development that could assure the block’s internal cohesion.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One example of this is the introduction of the    MAC (Mechanism for Competitive Adaptation) in 2006. Argentina had pressed for    this policy, but Uruguay, Paraguay and the Brazilian business sector were against    this new institutional development according to Costa.<a name="tx38"></a><a href="#nt38"><sup>38</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Celso Amorim recognized the problem and promised    a "New Deal" for Mercosur’s small members in mid-2006, and a structural    fund (Focem) aimed at reducing asymmetries has been introduced.<a name="tx39"></a><a href="#nt39"><sup>39</sup></a>    During a visit by Lula to Uruguay in February 2007 shortly before US president    George Bush’s visit in Uruguay, Lula and V&aacute;zquez signed a number of agreements    aimed at reducing asymmetries and fostering economic development. Lula offered    an investment package to Uruguay in which amongst other things Petrobr&aacute;s    would invest in a number of projects in the energy sector and the Brazilian    multinational Carmargo Corr&ecirc;a would invest in a cement factory. The package    also included policies that should facilitate Uruguayan exports to Brazil and    thus counteract Uruguay’s trade deficit with Brazil and credit facilities from    BNDES that should help finance investment projects.<a name="tx40"></a><a href="#nt40"><sup>40</sup></a>    In an interview given to the newspaper Financial Times briefly before Lula’s    visit in Uruguay, Celso Amorim argued that even though there had been attempts    to diminish asymmetries between Brazil and Uruguay after Brazil’s devaluation    in 1999, this had not helped enough and Uruguayan exports never rose to the    level prior to the devaluation. Therefore, there was a need for more affirmative    action in order to strengthen Mercosur.<a name="tx41"></a><a href="#nt41"><sup>41</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is still not clear how this new Brazilian    initiative will work out. However, it can be seen as an example of Brazil’s    doctrine of showing solidarity and fighting asymmetries in its relationship    to Mercosur partners and other South American countries. This doctrine has been    further advanced recently by the Brazilian government that is planning to intensify    its efforts to reduce Brazil’s export surplus in South America by undertaking    trade missions that aim at identifying potential exporters in other South American    countries. Brazil’s trade surplus in South America reached US$ 10.6 billion    in 2006.<a name="tx42"></a><a href="#nt42"><sup>42</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The renewed emphasis on trade balance is an instrument    in working for the reduction of asymmetries and for creating a prosperous South    America. Brazil’s export has grown substantially during the Lula government    reaching just above US$ 41 billion in 2006. This has helped to stabilize the    economy and has reduced the foreign debt/export ratio from 3.6 in 1999 to 0.6    in 2006.<a name="tx43"></a><a href="#nt43"><sup>43</sup></a> Brazil’s emphasis    on creating large export surpluses during the first Lula government has been    essential in assuring this positive result and may also to some degree explain    the relative lack of attention given to trade asymmetries in Mercosur. Another    factor may also have been that the government’s emphasis on creating South American    unity provoked a reduced attention to internal cohesion in Mercosur. The PSCI    policy aimed at reducing Brazilian trade surpluses with other South American    countries including Mercosur members seems visionary and as a useful tool in    creating growth in South America and an improved image of Brazil that could    improve its possibilities of a leadership role in a more united South America.    As the trade figures show, Brazil now has more space to undertake such an uncommon    policy of actively seeking to increase imports and reduce own export surpluses.    Although such a strategy could be criticized as being overly ideological by    not emphasizing Brazil’s own business possibilities, such a criticism does not    seem valid. Growing exports in other South American countries should increase    their import capacity and agreements such as the ones reached between Brazil    and Uruguay help Brazilian businesses to expand their activities regionally.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brazil’s support to Uruguay may help Uruguay    on its growth path and reduce asymmetries in Mercosur. For now, the cooperative    attitude has been useful in maintaining Uruguay inside Mercosur and in increasing    cohesion.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Argentina</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Lula government has been criticized for being    too willing to accommodate Argentina’s complaints within Mercosur.<a name="tx44"></a><a href="#nt44"><sup>44</sup></a>    Critics see Argentina as a free rider in Mercosur, a country that is not giving    enough priority to Mercosur but instead pursues an egotistical and nationalist    trade policy. Jos&eacute; Guilhon De Albuquerque finds that Brazil’s willingness    to accommodate Argentina hurts the interests of Brazilian business. This policy    is wrong-headed and based on Brazil’s political agenda of strengthening South    American integration and Brazilian leadership.<a name="tx45"></a><a href="#nt45"><sup>45</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr., disagrees with this    criticism of Argentina’s posture and Brazil’s response to it. He argues that    the Kirchner government’s use of protectionist measures and arguments for these    are acceptable and quite similar to the arguments Brazil uses in trade negotiations    with the developed countries when Brazil faces asymmetrical outcomes. Brazil    has consistently had bilateral surpluses with Argentina during the last years    and Argentina is eager to assure the survival of its industrial sectors after    having experienced a serious process of de-industrialization in the period from    1990 to 2001. Therefore, Argentina’s use of protectionist policies is not an    indication of Mercosur’s crisis but rather of the crisis of the liberal conception    of integration of the 1990s.<a name="tx46"></a><a href="#nt46"><sup>46</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Seen in this light, Brazil’s accommodating policy    line follows the government’s overall concern for reducing asymmetries between    Brazil and its South American trade partners. It is also a way to avoid a major    outfall between the two countries that could hurt Brazil’s strategy of South    American unity created on the basis of Mercosur in which Argentina and Brazil    form the axis. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It would potentially be highly risky for Brazil    to take a tough principled stand against Argentina to defend the short-term    interests of Brazilian business. Such a policy could get in the way of the strategic    partnership between the two countries and create an anti-Brazilian atmosphere    in Argentina that has a long tradition of rivalry with Brazil and that is sceptical    of Brazil’s wish to become a regional leader. From this perspective then, Brazil’s    policy towards Argentina can be considered pragmatic and rational.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other hand, unilateral measures from Argentina    are also problematic. In this sense the introduction of the MAC is an advance,    since it institutionalizes the use of safeguard mechanisms along lines agreed    upon, at least between Argentina and Brazil. It is understandable that Argentina    after its deep crisis in 2001 and 2002 felt a need to defend its industrial    structure, but it would be good for Mercosur if solutions to such problems could    be found through dialogue and consensus between all Mercosur partners. Unilateral    nationalist responses based on differences in interest and in perceptions about    how to advance the national interest in a context of regional integration can    create setbacks in the integration process. When such unilateral actions are    taken, though, an attitude of dialogue and negotiation seems the way forward.    The opposite could obstruct the regional integration process. It is conceivable,    of course, that unilateral measures take an intolerable scope and character,    but this has not been the case in the relationship to Argentina. The Brazilian    government has found that Brazil’s large exports to Argentina and Argentina’s    difficulties in the industrial sector means that Brazil should be pragmatic    towards Argentina.<a name="tx47"></a><a href="#nt47"><sup>47</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Bolivia</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bolivia may well become the sixth member of Mercosur.    Negotiations are under way. Bolivia, however, has pursued nationalist policies    of nationalization of energy resources quite forcefully, apparently without    much concern for the impact of such policies on neighbouring countries such    as Brazil. On the first of May in 2006, Evo Morales declared the nationalization    of hydrocarbons and gave foreign companies including Petrobr&aacute;s 180 days    to make new agreements with Bolivia. In order to deal diplomatically with this    issue, the presidents of Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela met to discuss    the measure on May fourth. In an interview after the meeting, Lula recognized    that Bolivia had a right to define its policies in the energy area with autonomy    and that Brazil should take a cooperative attitude. He further argued that what    might look like a insurmountable conflict was rather the result of the consolidation    of a democratic process in South America and expressed a willingness to discuss    with Ch&aacute;vez and Kirchner what the three governments could do together    to contribute to Bolivia’s development and work towards unity in Mercosur and    South America.<a name="tx48"></a><a href="#nt48"><sup>48</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This attitude provoked a nationalist reaction    in Brazil particularly from those who wanted Brazil to work more towards a free    trade agreement with the United States, according to Batista Jr.<a name="tx49"></a><a href="#nt49"><sup>49</sup></a>    Marcelo de Paiva Abreu criticized the government’s posture strongly arguing    that the government should adopt more defensive policies towards Evo Morales    and Ch&aacute;vez and that it ought not have accepted Ch&aacute;vez as a part    in the negotiation over the response to Bolivia’s nationalizations. Abreu is    strongly critical of the closer ties between Brazil and Ch&aacute;vez who he    believes has an unacceptable posture towards the Bush government<a name="tx50"></a><a href="#nt50"><sup>50</sup></a>    It can be argued that the posture taken by the Lula government seemed in line    with ALBA’s ideological doctrine but also in line with its own doctrine of "humanism    and solidarity" and fight against asymmetries. The government was criticized    for an overly ideological and political approach to the matter rather than a    more rational approach emphasizing economic interests. However, as Amorim argues    in an interview in October 2006 when negotiations about the new conditions for    exploration of energy were taking place, Brazil recognized Bolivia’s right to    nationalize their energy resources, something that Bolivia had already decided    to do in a referendum under the previous government in 2004. Therefore, it was    not in Brazil’s interest with a more radical response, what was important was    to reach a fair negotiated agreement, and such an agreement was getting closer.<a name="tx51"></a><a href="#nt51"><sup>51</sup></a>    The agreement that was eventually reached was criticized by the opposition newspaper    O Estado de S&atilde;o Paulo in an editorial. According to the newspaper, Petrobr&aacute;s    gave in to the pressure from Bolivia and accepted a bad deal.<a name="tx52"></a><a href="#nt52"><sup>52</sup></a>    Ricardo Dreitenfuss, however, argues along the lines of the government. According    to him, the government’s reaction was adequate and built on the defence of Brazil’s    national interests. There was no use in a strongly negative reaction against    Bolivia. This would only increase the problem and was likely to lead to the    implosion of South American cooperation. Similarly he defended Brazil’s policy    of solidarity and humanism.<a name="tx53"></a><a href="#nt53"><sup>53</sup></a>    From this perspective then, Brazil’s reaction can be seen as being at the same    time pragmatic and rational <I>and </I>ideological in a positive sense. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In 2007, Bolivia has furthered its activist and    nationalist policy. On the first of May in 2007, the Bolivian government declared    that Petrobr&aacute;s’ two refineries in the country are to be nationalized.    The aim is to assure Bolivia’s control in the energy sector and to increase    the revenues of the government. At the moment, Petrobr&aacute;s and the Bolivian    government are negotiating the price to be paid for the refineries and the energy    stocked up there. Bolivia is offering a price much lower than the one demanded    by Petrobr&aacute;s. The company negotiates with a view of reaching an agreement    in order to avoid damage to bilateral relations, and at the same time the Brazilian    government is defending a similar posture as in October 2006, namely that a    fair price needs to be found. The implicit threat is that if such an agreement    is not found Brazil may revoke promised economic aid and perhaps suspend the    agreement reached in February 2007 on Brazilian gas exports from Bolivia that    allowed a sizeable increase in Bolivia’s gas income.<a name="tx54"></a><a href="#nt54"><sup>54</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The bilateral relationship between Bolivia and    Brazil shows that Brazil cannot control the integration process in spite of    its superior power resources. It also shows that the heterogeneity in South    America makes regional integration and South American unity a highly challenging    goal to reach. However, Lula’s argument that the conflict should mainly be seen    as a result of a democratic process in South America seems valid. The Bolivian    population favours nationalization as does the Venezuelan government. The short    time loss Petrobr&aacute;s and Brazil will have to accept can best be turned    to long term gains if the government maintains its posture of acceptance of    Bolivia’s nationalization policy and at the same time seeks to negotiate as    good a deal as possible. This is exactly the posture taken by the Brazilian    government. The threat of sanctions is likely to mainly focus on pacifying domestic    criticisms of a too soft approach, although it cannot be ruled out that Brazil    may carry out the sanctions. This however would be likely to create a crisis    in the relationship to Bolivia and Venezuela that is Bolivia’s ally. It does    not seem likely that the Lula government will risk such a development that would    bring the ambition of South American unity to an abrupt end. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Venezuela</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Venezuela’s entry into Mercosur in July 2006    is probably the most controversial aspect of Brazil’s in Brazil’s foreign policy    inside Brazil. Venezuela’s president Hugo Ch&aacute;vez has an aggressive discourse    towards the United States and multinationals. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In his presidential campaign in 2006 he campaigned    on a platform of introducing socialism of the 21’st century in Venezuela, and    he likes to call US President Bush Mister Danger. Ch&aacute;vez won the elections    wide a wide margin, largely due to Venezuela’s economic growth and efforts at    social inclusion<a name="tx55"></a><a href="#nt55"><sup>55</sup></a> much like    Lula did in 2006. He has started on a program of nationalizations in different    economic sectors and on the first of May he paralleled Evo Morales’ nationalizations    in Bolivia when he consolidated the nationalization in the oil sector when he    mandated to occupy four oil companies operating in the oil rich Orinoco River.    The measure affected four multinational oil companies and will mean that the    Venezuelan state-owned oil giant PDVSA will have at least 60% of the shares    in the four companies. During the event where Ch&aacute;vez presented the measure    he celebrated that with this measure Venezuela closed down the opening of the    oil sector undertaken in the 1990s, arguing that the opening was an attempt    by imperialism to take possession of one of the worlds largest oil reserves.<a name="tx56"></a><a href="#nt56"><sup>56</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pedro da Motta Veiga sees the acceptance of Venezuela    as a full member of Mercosur as the biggest mistake in Brazil’s poor South America    policy.<a name="tx57"></a><a href="#nt57"><sup>57</sup></a> On the other extreme,    Moniz Bandeira argued in early 2006 that Venezuela’s planned entry into Mercosur,    though it would not please the Bush government, it would strengthen Mercosur’s    bargaining power. He argued that Mercosur should not keep out any South American    country and that Venezuela had an enormous strategic importance for a number    of reasons. It has large oil reserves, it would give Brazil access to the Caribbean    and it shares a long border with Brazil in the Amazon. Together with Argentina    and Brazil, Venezuela is planning to construct an enormous gas pipeline that    will go through the three countries. All of these aspects could benefit Mercosur.<a name="tx58"></a><a href="#nt58"><sup>58</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Brazilian government finds that the relationship    with Ch&aacute;vez Venezuela is good. In an interview shortly after Ch&aacute;vez    the announcements of a number of privatizations in January 2007, Brazil’s foreign    minister Celso Amorim argues that Ch&aacute;vez and Venezuela work well from    the perspective of Brazilian interests pointing out that Brazil exported for    almost US$ 4 billion to Venezeula in 2006 and that Brazil has a large export    surplus with Venezuela. He further argued that he did not find that Venezuela’s    economic model and Brazil’s were incompatible, but that they should not expect    to export their economic model to Brazil.<a name="tx59"></a><a href="#nt59"><sup>59</sup></a>    In fact, Venezuela is working very well for Brazilian business interests. In    2006, exports to Venezuela increased by 61.7% in comparison to 2005. This represents    the highest percentage expansion amongst Brazil’s 12 largest export markets    where Venezuela is now the tenth biggest.<a name="tx60"></a><a href="#nt60"><sup>60</sup></a>    Apart from exports, Brazilian investments have also growing considerably in    Venezuela in recent years and a number of common projects are in the planning.<a name="tx61"></a><a href="#nt61"><sup>61</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The relationship with Venezuela seems to work    quite well, although it would seem that Venezuela’s entry into Mercosur may    complicate the block’s international trade negotiations. Some fear that it will    make a trade agreement with the United States even harder to get. On the other    hand this may not be a big problem as Brazil seems content with the "FTAA    lite" agreement entered in 2003. Also, Brazil is negotiating ways to cooperate    with the United States in the area of bio-energy that has become a strategic    sector at the top of the Lula government’s priorities in recent months. There    is, of course, a possibility that Venezuela will gain a central role maybe even    competing with Brazil to be the one setting the agenda in Mercosur. On the other    hand, the agenda of Brazil and Venezuela have a number of points in common such    as emphasis on social policy, construction of a multipolar world order and energy    integration in South America. They differ on the economic model and on the relative    weight of the state in the economy, and while Ch&aacute;vez is aggressive in    his criticisms of US president George Bush, the Lula government has another    approach. Brazilian leaders criticize US policies that they think are wrong-headed    and negotiate interests firmly but there is a good relationship between Lula    and Bush and the two countries seek to cooperate. One could also consider if    the alternative to including Ch&aacute;vez in Mercosur would be better. Probably    not. In fact there is a danger that an explicit exclusion of Venezuela could    harm South American regional integration and push countries like Bolivia and    Ecuador away from Mercosur. It is also possible that it will have a moderating    factor on Ch&aacute;vez to have to negotiate inside Mercosur where he will have    to respect the opinions and interests of the other member countries even if    he does not agree with them. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

In fact, it has been argued that the dominating    current of thinking with regard to South American integration during the first    presidency of Lula has been the one that has prioritized the expansion of Mercosur    and the creation of the South American Community of Nations (CASA). The less    influential current emphasized the deepening of Mercosur. The creation of the    Mercosur Parliament and the Olivos Protocol on dispute settlement are part of    that agenda, which has had some influence as well.<a name="tx62"></a><a href="#nt62"><sup>62</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The free trade agreement between Mercosur and    the Andean Community (CAN) was introduced in 2005. The Brazilian national industrial    federation finds that the agreement is unbalanced and favours the market access    to Mercosur of the Andean countries over Mercosur’s market access.<a name="tx63"></a><a href="#nt63"><sup>63</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Veiga and Rios point criticize the agreement    in the sense that the advantages Mercosur that the agreement gives Mercosur    do not equal the more substantial advantages reached by the United States in    its bilateral free trade agreements with Peru and Colombia.<a name="tx64"></a><a href="#nt64"><sup>64</sup></a>    Batista Jr. points out that these bilateral agreements are incompatible with    Mercosur since the bilateral agreements include rules in government procurement,    investments and the service sector that the Mercosur country were unwilling    to agree to in the FTAA negotiations.<a name="tx65"></a><a href="#nt65"><sup>65</sup></a>    The Brazilian government sees the CAN-Mercosur agreement in a more positive    light. Amorim argues that the agreement was a step in the way towards South    American free trade and that it was the basis that made it possible to create    CASA<a name="tx66"></a><a href="#nt66"><sup>66</sup></a>, and that all asymmetries    and sensibilities of the Andes countries were taken into concern.<a name="tx67"></a><a href="#nt67"><sup>67</sup></a>    He further argues that CASA with its focus on infrastructure integration helps    create one big and integrated area, a <I>South American Circle</I> (in his words),    tying the whole continent together. He envisions that CASA should lead to a    South American union in the future and argues for the institutionalization of    CASA with the creation of a permanent secretariat.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Amorim’s arguments again show the emphasis given    to agreements that seek to deal with asymmetries and protect weaker economies.    Furthermore, it seems clear that while the long term goal envisioned by the    Brazilian government may be a South American economic and political union then    the short term goal is to integrate South America through infrastructure projects    as a way to increase the continent’s international competitiveness through the    systemic upgrading of the economic system that infrastructure integration creates.    Even if South America never may turn out to reach the degree of political integration    and unity that Amorim seems to envision, infrastructure integration could increase    the overall efficiency of the South American economy and thereby contribute    to the priority strategic goal of creating a prosperous South America. Even    if Peru and Colombia (and Chile) maintain free trade agreements with the United    States that are incompatible with Mercosur, trade and investment agreements    and infrastructure projects could create common benefits for South American    nations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Recently, a new initiative in the realm of South    American integration was set in motion, namely the first South American Energy    Summit. The meeting took place in mid-April 2007 on the Venezuelan Isla Margarita.    The topic of the summit was cooperation and integration in the energy sector    in South America. In an interview after the meeting Lula argued for the institutionalization    of this initiative through the creation of a permanent secretariat. He argued    that energy is the key to the development of the region and underlined that    he believed that renewable energy such as ethanol and bio-diesel could be the    way out of poverty for the poorest countries in the world, including poor South    American countries, arguing that a strategy aimed at producing renewable energy    should not get in the way of the production of food and that the world’s nutrition    problems were not caused by the lack of food but by the lack of income.<a name="tx68"></a><a href="#nt68"><sup>68</sup></a>    It is too early to say which results this new initiative will give.

Some    think that the many initiatives show a lack of strategy. However, there seems    to be coherence between the different initiatives. They all point toward creating    closer economic and political ties between South American nations. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mercosur has been deepened and expanded in recent    years in spite of the challenges posed by the recent development crisis. A strong    emphasis on "solidarity" and on reducing asymmetries is helping to    create internal cohesion in spite of Mercosur’s heterogeneity and different    domestic and external policies. Thus, nationalism does not seem to create overly    serious problems in the integration process. Brazil has taken a pragmatic approach    and it seems that Mercosur is slowly creating new regulations and rules that    may help reduce the use of unilateral measures.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Difficulties are larger when it comes to the    case of Bolivia. Bolivia has taken several unilateral measures that have hurt    Brazilian interests and has shown that Brazil finds it difficult to translate    its superior power resources into actual influence. Brazil has taken a pragmatic    and patient approach to the conflicts with Bolivia and has thus avoided a major    setback that could create problems between Brazil and other South American countries,    particularly Venezuela. As the biggest economy and as the only Portuguese speaking    country in the region Brazil has to step carefully to avoid being seen in a    negative light. Although, Bolivia’s actions find internal legitimacy and initially    also external legitimacy, the newest round of nationalizations seems unnecessarily    aggressive, and Bolivia may run the risk of scaring foreign investors away.    The same may be the case in Venezuela. However, so far it seems that the different    types of economic models chosen by different countries is not getting in the    way of closer integration. Nationalism does not seem to get in the way of regional    integration in Mercosur and in South America. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">An increased level of South American cooperation    can also be observed in countries that do not pursue radical leftist and nationalist    policies. However, it may turn out to be difficult to reach ever higher levels    of integration with the countries that have bilateral free trade agreements    with the United States that are incompatible with Mercosur. This, though, does    not mean that higher levels of cooperation and coordination in different areas    such as trade, investments, infrastructure and energy cannot be reached. It    seems that this is already happening. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brazilian nationalism has the potential of creating    problems for regional integration. In Brazil, foreign policy has become a major    issue of debate in civil society and there is a minority opinion that is highly    critical of Brazil’s cooperation with Venezuela and the weak response to nationalizations    in Bolivia. In this group, which is represented by industrial interest groups    and parts of the political opposition such as the PSDB, there is scepticism    towards the Lula government’s strong emphasis on fighting asymmetries between    South American countries and its emphasis on South American integration, even    with the "bad" nationalist leftist governments, and South-South cooperation.    The opinion is that this policy is overly ideological and irrational and that    a more rational policy would be to seek an international insertion that emphasizes    cooperation with the EU and the United States more. The last elections in Brazil    indicate, though, that the government has a strong mandate to pursue its agenda.    The doctrine put out by Samuel Pinheiro Guimar&atilde;es gas guided the government’s    actions and has been successful in maintaining integration moving forward in    spite of the challenges. Brazil is essential to the continued widening and deepening    of regional integration in South America. Brazil’s decisive role largely stems    from its superior economic resources and diplomatic skill. If Brazil is able    to maintain its policies there are chances that South America will move towards    higher economic prosperity creation through a systemic strengthening of South    American economies. If this happens, it is likely that perceptions of South    American integration and Brazil’s role in it will gradually become more and    more positive in neighbouring countries making the continuity of South American    integration likely. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Recebido em 10 de abril de 2007    <br>   Aprovado em 15 de junho de 2007</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="nt01"></a><a href="#tx01">1</a> OLIVEIRA,    Am&acirc;ncio Jorge de; O&Ntilde;UKI, Janine; VEIGA, Jo&atilde;o Paulo C.

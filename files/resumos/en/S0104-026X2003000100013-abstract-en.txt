In the present article, I try to recover the literary memory of the Brazilian women of the nineteenth century by reviewing some periodicals driven by them. I do focus specially in Juana Paula Manso, founder of the Ladies' Journal, considered as to be the first feminine periodical in Brazil. I bring it up to discussion by introducing Maria Josefa Pereira Pinto's periodical issued prior to Juana Paula Manso's one. Although the political disappearance that surrounded them, I reinforce their importance with the intention to arouse the women conciousness to the need to conquer their fundamental rights. Mainly, those related to Education, profession and voting.

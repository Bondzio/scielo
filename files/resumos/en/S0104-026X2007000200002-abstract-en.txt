On this article the author aims to stimulate discussion as to how reinvent the project of feminism for a globalizing world, situating those shifts, in the context of changes in postwar capitalism and post-communist geopolitics. US feminism finds itself at an impasse, stymied by the hostile, post-9/11 political climate. The cutting edge of gender struggle has shifted away from the United States to transnational spaces, such as "Europe". What lies behind this geographical shif? what are its political implications for the future of the feminist project?

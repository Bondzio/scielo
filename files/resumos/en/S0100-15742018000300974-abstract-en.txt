ABSTRACT The article analyzes the androcentric representation of work in Chilean books. Using the Appraisal framework for Studies of Discourse, it can be concluded that even with the greater inclusion of women in recent years, the androcentrism is expressed in four main aspects: consideration of work from a traditionally male perspective devalues the reproductive function; representation of women in traditionally female roles; overvaluation of the physical and psychological capabilities of men versus the construction of poor and suffering women; and, representation of women integrated into the labor market as a recent social phenomenon, which ignores the historic female participation in the world of work.

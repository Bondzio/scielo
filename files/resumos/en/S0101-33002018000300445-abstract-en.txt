ABSTRACT This article deals with Walter Benjamin&#8217;s techniques of writing, a writing which is at the same time poetical and philosophical. Moving along the shocks of modern life and the deepness of collective desire, this way of writing makes collide what is more up-to-date with what is more antique by the mean of a style theorized with irony by the author in the margin of his great works.

Abstract: The continuous reflection of the Brazilian Anthropology on its own development has required a careful analysis of the various research fields that comprise it, including the Anthropology of Education. Seeking to contribute to this debate, I propose in this article to analyze the profile and the role of anthropologists in the Graduate Program in Education in Brazil, developing a reflection from there on the place of anthropology in the Brazilian educational field.

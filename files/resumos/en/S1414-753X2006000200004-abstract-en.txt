The effects of land uses and management activities (e.g. engineering projects) to the environment and society are becoming more evident even to lay people. This circumstance leads to a gradual difficulty to obtain a pacific implementation of engineering work that implies alteration on land use, due to public rejection. The paper focuses on the need to adopt measures to entail information and participation of the stakeholders in the decision-making process. This new procedure requires techniques usually used in quality planning and management and allows for the conjugation of social and ecological values as well the consideration of interdisciplinary knowledge within the decision making process. This work presents a revision, reflection of the available methodologies for this issue and proposes a methodology to develop and implement the decision-making process based on stakeholder participation.

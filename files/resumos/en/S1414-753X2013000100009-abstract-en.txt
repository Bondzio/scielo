The purpose of this article is to describe the case of a manufacturer of cement that have deployed and consolidated the coprocessing of rice husk and scrap tires in clinker kilns, supported by reverse logistics practices. The research method was the case study. The company studied already use rice husk as alternative fuel and received an offer from the tyre industry for burning scrap tires in clinker kilns. To take advantage of the offer, the company integrated direct and reverse flows of raw materials, fuels and industrial waste, reducing more than 30% the transportation cost. The combined coprocessing partially replaced fossil fuels originated in the oil industry. The environmental gain more important was the burning reduction of about 10,000 tons of fossil fuel, which entailed the generation of about 30,000 tons of CO2 per year.

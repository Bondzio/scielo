This article aims to verify the consistency of the pluralization of coalition groups and strategic partnerships in the foreign policy of the Lula Government (2003-2010). The central hypothesis of this research is that the new matrix of foreign policy is more fluid and multidimensional, with political arrangements, strategic alliances and partnerships that are flexible, according to the actors and interests concerned. In order to test the hypothesis, this research used literature as methodology the review of the concepts of coalition groups, variable geometry and strategic partnership in the analysis of recent Brazilian foreign policy, from a conceptual and empirical description. Then went on to cross the data for the variable geometry groups and coalitions with list of strategic partnerships in Brazil, to identify points of convergence and divergence. Later, a crossing of information with Brazilian business partnerships is made, also in order to identify continuities and discontinuities.

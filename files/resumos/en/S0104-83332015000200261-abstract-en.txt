AbstractThe constant expansion of the agenda of social demands for rights, especially in the human rights key, its translation in moral terms and the judicialization of social relations are the central issues of this text. I propose, here, an analysis of modes of justice production in cases of "gender violence" in two moments: a first, before the Law 11340/2006, from a rereading of the ethnographic work at the women's police station of Joao Pessoa, especially focusing on what can be called "police mediation"; subsequently, I present a reflection on the justice practices's application of Law 11340 observed between 2008 and 2009 in Florianopolis, highlighting the adoption of "judicial pardon" in "ratification hearings". Finally, I propose a reflection on the moral and politic dimensions of struggles for rights, and on the specific type of judicialization that is established in this process of struggle for rights in the field of "gender violence".

The first section of this article focuses on feminist art produced in Portugal. Most of the references concerning artists, activists and groups were surveyed and accessed online, a work process that combined the consultation and requests for statements of the artists about their artworks. The second section aims to measure the production conditions of feminist art in Portugal. This was achieved mainly through the online data collection relating to representation of men and women artists in some of the main artistic institutions. Additionally, were articulated some witnesses of artistic agents to document some of the obstacles present in the Portuguese art world imposed on women artists, as well feminist artists.

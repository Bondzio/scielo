Abstract In this paper, I analyze the experiences of (not) passing as a men and/or women as contemporary performances of femininities and masculinities in order to go beyond the comprehension of a totally autonomous subject in face of their experiences of gender and sexuality, nor to take it from an idea of cultural determinism. From the ethnography of online and offline spaces, interviews and documentary analysis, I discuss the identification and the desire of recognition from different interlocutors considering some social markers of difference. I conclude that the act of (not) passing as occurs through the possibility of action before several elements, in a context of appreciation of the differences, but also rejections and discrimination towards the ones considered too different.

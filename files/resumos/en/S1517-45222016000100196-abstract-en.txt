This paper aims to analyze current perspectives for a functionalist theory of society. Drawing on both the functionalist theory of Talcott Parsons and the systemic approach of Niklas Luhmann, a model for functional analysis based on the scheme problem/solution is proposed. The advantages and limitations of this proposal are then discussed, and new approaches to contemporary functionalism are proposed.

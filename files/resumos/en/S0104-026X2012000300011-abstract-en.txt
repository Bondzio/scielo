This article is taken from a research made under a microsociological approach, and realized with working-class women who, in spite of a double chore routine as mothers, housewives and professionals, decide to pursue their studies in the university, turning their routine into a triple chore one. Besides highlighting some strategies of survival and of remaining at the university even if longer than expected, this work also displays how they come to a compromise between their duties as housewives, workers and university students. At the same time we try to show how women-victims become women-individuals. They are aware of their limitations, but shy away from giving up their dreams.

The big events are globalizing in the same way that places promoted as brands are spreading. Although autonomous, these processes are related by being founded in a vision that the places have to compete in the globalization and that the competition must occur based on their images. This type of competition bases itself in a discourse produced by place marketing professionals that manage built symbolic forms as well as engage in the production of new elements in order to configure them, such as products&#8217; brands, as a competitive differential. In this article, the action of these marketing professionals is investigated, and they are comprehended as artificers of a &#8220;world common sense&#8221; that resignifies the image of the place from the conception of a brand. The assumptions of this discourse will be analyzed as well as the legitimacy instances and its relation with big events that may be understood as spaces of consecration and circulation of the place marketing discourse.

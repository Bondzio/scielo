Abstract: This research forms a gender study based on the novel Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James (2012), due to its major impact as a mass phenomenon worldwide, which influences, above all, the female group. As this novel exalts gender violence, this study aims to analyze the keys to its success through an explanatory research in which gender inequality in society is valued from the acceptance of the myths of romantic love and instances of accepted everyday machismo, also known as micromachismos, which are represented in this novel. At the same time, it aims to contrast whether there is a correlation between this success and a tendency to sadomasochistic sexual fantasies which may have been awaken in the reader community through this novel. With a sample of 102 subjects, results of the research revealed that these myths and micromachismos existing in society are, in many cases, identified in theory but accepted in daily practice. They also revealed that sadomasochism was not a successful ingredient in the impact of Fifty Shades of Grey.

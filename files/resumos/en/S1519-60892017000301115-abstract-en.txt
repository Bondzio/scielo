Abstract: While interested in non-standard experiences of modernity this article delves into &#8220;classic&#8221; oeuvres of the so-called Brazilian social thought as it searches for alternative concepts, categories and perspectives on modern sociability. It starts with the investigation of the premises that underlie and circumscribe the works of some of the most prestigious interpreters of Brazil. It then sheds lights on key components of the hegemonic frame of reference that informs sociological accounts on modernity up to these days. Finally, in light of contemporary social theory, the article lays out some elements for a counter-hegemonic discourse of modernity.

The representative political system has become synonymous of modern democracy. The paper analyzes the development of the concept of representation, in association with the process of institutionalization of the parliament, by means of a sociogenetic approach that highlights some distinctive and defining elements of the concerned processes of social change. The results point to a pendular movement of concession of representation by the Crown, as a way of enforcing and ensuring legitimacy, to the incorporation of representation as a right and as an impeller mechanism in the process of institutionalization of the Legislative Power.

ABSTRACT The moda-de-viola [folk guitar songs] is considered one of the most traditional genres of country music, a narrative genre approaching the old medieval legends and romances of the Iberian Renaissance when it was still an affluent of Moorish culture. Its themes reveal a social functionality that, by conveying pedagogical and moral values, and by expressing poetically and musically certain specific social contexts, serves as a tool to denounce and criticize processes of exclusion and social oppression. This article presents a brief description of the first records collected by folklorists in the early twentieth century, of the dilemmas arising from its insertion in the phonographic record from 1929 onward, and of the contradictions in the perpetuation of this genre over time, focusing mainly on its potentiality in the field of identity studies.

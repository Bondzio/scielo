Abstract The concept of "territorial development" has become, in recent years, a guide to the State's ways of promoting development policies and fighting poverty in Brazil. Thus, the territorial approach began to be used as a reference for a strategy to support rural development, through the implementation of actions covered by the Program for the Sustainable Development of Rural Territories. Considering women&#8217;s role in shaping "rural territories", we propose, in this article, to confront the concept of territory that guides the actions of the Program of Sustainable Development of Rural Territories and the way in which the territory is configured in and through these women&#8217;s daily practices.

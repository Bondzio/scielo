Abstract This paper aims to analyze the urban inequalities of the main cities of the country through Welfare Urban Index (IBEU), prepared by the Observatory of the Metropolises. As the analysis of IBEU reveal urban welfare inequities within cities, it seeks to relate these urban inequalities with the socio-economic profile of the people that make up the different areas of the metropolis. It is observed clear correspondence between urban inequalities and social inequalities, which leads us to reflect their explanatory mechanisms, through the processes of socio-spatial differentiation, segmentation and segregation and also through the circular causation process of distribution of urban public resources.

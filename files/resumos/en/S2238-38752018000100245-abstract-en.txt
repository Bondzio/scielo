Abstract In this article I discuss the inauguration of the Sala São Paulo concert hall, the headquarters of OSESP, on July 9th 1999, the landmark event in the &#8216;restructuring&#8217; of the orchestra, a process that started after the death of maestro Eleazar de Carvalho. The choice of the event&#8217;s date (July 9th) and of the name of the concert hall (Sala São Paulo) indicate the effort made to create an idea of &#8216;Paulista pride,&#8217; in which the conflicts and contradictions of social experience were to be erased by the timeless and universal properties of classical music. Through an ethnographical reconstruction of the inauguration concert, I discuss how dissonant voices have found their way to be heard, revealing the contradictions of the orchestra&#8217;s project.

Abstract Through social conflict is possible to observe the transformation of Pernambuco Semi-Arid Outback. This analysis is based on the critical methodology of value aggregation in the exploration process of new natural reserves. This allows the emergence of new commodities and disembedding of traditional social ties (Alvater &amp; Mahnkop, 2007; Giddens, 1991). In the past were the climatic disadvantages and the harsh local nature that boosted the social organization of this territory. Nowadays are the Semi-arid valorization and the richness of the Caatinga biome that motivating its transformation. In both moments the space transformation is characterized by the distance between society and nature and by time and space singular relation in a local level (Giddens, 1991). The transformation of the two mentioned moments is drawn by peculiar ways of violence: At first was through the native population extermination and currently is the exploration of productive natural reserves.

Using the theoretical reference of the cultural studies- mainly some foucauldian and feminist studies notions- this paper focuses upon the influence of films on the construction of gender identities. After a brief discussion on aspects of culture, power and identities formation, the meanings established by a group of elderly women on films they have attended during their youth are analyzed. We bring into evidence the effects that thediscourses present in that media had upon those women's identitary construction and production.

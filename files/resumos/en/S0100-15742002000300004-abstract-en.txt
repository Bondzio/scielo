This article is concerned with the epistemological basics of the curriculum of the future. It begins by examining current debates on the impact on the curriculum of changes in the global economy. The major part of the paper is concerned with an explication and comparison of two social theories of knowledge - those of Emile Durkheim and the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, with a particular focus on the concern with the origins of knowledge and the relationship between everyday and theoretical knowledge. It argues that the genetic/historical approach adopted by Vygotsky needs to be combined with Durkheim's focus on the social reality of knowledge itself. It concludes with some observations on the implications of the comparison for contemporary curriculum theory.

This study investigated how adolescents in lower class groups view the possibility of talking about sexuality in the family. Focus groups were held with girls from two elementary schools in a city in the inland of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. After a content analysis results indicated that sexuality is hardly treated in the family because parents find it difficult to discuss it; they resort to strategies to evade the subject. Given their parents' silence, the adolescents seek other sources of information and dialogue, mainly their friends. Despite the complexity of the subject, adolescents demonstrate a desire to learn about it. This study highlights the relevance of intervention programs that aim to work with parents on the possibility of establishing a dialogue about the subject.

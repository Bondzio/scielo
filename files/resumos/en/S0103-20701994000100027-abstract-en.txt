The author studies the Carnival shows in the cities Tatu&#237;, Piracicaba and S&#227;o Jo&#227;o Del Rei. Based on the observation of the ways by which Carnival is celebrated at the parties and in the streets of these cities, she questions usual interpretations that conceive Carnaval as a situation in which all the norms citizens usually adapt themselves to seem to be abolished. On the contrary, the research shows that the daily social structure lasts during this feast, a fact that can be realized by noticing the separation of the coarse jesters and spectators, the presence of different social groups at the parties and in the various Carnival "blocs" [groups of people who dance together in the festive procession]. These facts point out that the persons' socio-economic origins are carried on during the Carnival days.

In this article we will present the concept of non-classical labor (De la Garza, 2010) in an attempt to explain not only the differences among types of work, but also to address broader dimensions, which are partially included in other theories (Thompson, 1983). We will attempt to clarify the concept and its scope, as well as the relations with the services activities, which have gained constantly increasing importance in modern economies, even in less developed ones. We will recall the classical concept of flexibility (Durand, 2004) and the extent to which it would be pertinent to include non-classical labor. More specifically, we will include a form of flexibilization which has probably become dominant in capitalism since the most recent great economic crisis, outsourcing (Moncada e Monsalvo, 2000) and its connections with non-classical labor. Lastly, we will discuss the thesis of fragmented identities (Sennett e Cobb, 1972) and voluntary servitude (Durand, 2006) in the vein of the approach mentioned in the nonclassical article, culminating in considerations on the possibility of training subjects who work under these conditions.

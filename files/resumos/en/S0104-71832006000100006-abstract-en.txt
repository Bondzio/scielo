The epistemology enunciated in the proceeding lines asks and continuously repeats: Why and for whom are territorial studies?, suggesting through these that approaches to local processes essentially require the application of interdisciplinary points of view and methods matched with modelizations that contain the double challenge: first, to be open to reflexion and, second to possibly be applied to the immediate local reality.

abstract Given the current environmental crisis, various scientific disciplines have striven to analyze it and identify solutions to resolve or minimize the environmental and social damage caused by economic activities and other types of environmental stress factors. This article proposes to briefly show how the predominant geographic vision has changed in the Western world with regard to the relationship between human populations and the environment. This change of vision was a reflection of the changes that were taking place in Geography as a whole, with allowances for differences between countries. It is also argued that the environmental crisis is a crisis of knowledge, as some authors claim. The text culminates with the virtues and limitations of Geography in the pursuit of this understanding, with the aim of advancing it.

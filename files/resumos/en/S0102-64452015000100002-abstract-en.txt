The article seeks to rethink the concept of public sphere in two levels of reconstruction. First, we understand the public sphere not in purely normative terms, but as a socially constituted point of departure for the reconstruction of critical categories. Secondly, keeping the methodological concern with the practical genesis of the concept, we show how the concept of public sphere can be reconstructed as a process of circulation of power that allows us to critically diagnose the current relationship between politics and law, specifically the democratization of the political system putted in motion by social conflicts.

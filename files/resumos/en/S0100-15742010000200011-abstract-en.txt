Intra-university practice and its self-legitimizing rules have no direct relationship with the professional practices of university graduates. So, study plans may be systematically dissociated from professional needs, but this does not implyes any dysfunction within university activity. It is true that the University has no reason to respond mechanically to the demands of the market, but the institution must assume that the notion of social criticism is to result immanent to the professional practice for which it prepares students. Otherwise, it prepares them for unemployment and unsuitable employment, or for a discourse that will be abandoned as soon as they start their professional activities.

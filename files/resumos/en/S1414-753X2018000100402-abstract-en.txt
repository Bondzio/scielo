Abstract Watersheds used for water supply get special attention from managers, as the quantity and quality of supplied water depends on them. Water is an indispensable element of life and a fundamental resource for many human activities. The situation of these watersheds is aggravated by conflicts of land use that end up intensifying the process of erosion and sedimentation of the water reservoirs. In addition, diagnostics that use environmental indicators are important tools for environmental planning. The present study made use of these indicators to evaluate the natural soil susceptibility to erosion in the catchment area of the DNOS water reservoir, in Santa Maria, south of Brazil. Using multi-thematic maps and geoprocessing tools (GIS), we obtained a vulnerability mapping, represented by indexes. This map is an important and skillful tool for territorial planning, for aiding environmental management and conservation of water resources.

This article begins with the presentation of our previous study on children's ideas about their right to privacy. It continues with a review of the literature highlighting how schools treat children's rights, in order to begin to define, in general terms, the context in which children construct knowledge. Next, the article presents the first categories that have emerged from an an√°lisis of the data. These are precious categories because of their specific objective of relieving institutional actions related with students' privacy, whether to take it into or to challenge it. This relationship has not been addressed in the literature before. Finally, it presents an analysis that links, provisionally, the children's cognitive productions with the social conditions under which they are built. This is done by triangulating the empirical evidence of both data collection techniques.

The farm is each time more recognized as an object of complex study. This if becomes important when the farm is the object to supply an advice of orientation or an aid to the management, or the scope of a plan of agricultural development. For the dairy farms in agricultural borders of the Amazon, characterized by an important diversity of operation mode, the modeling of the diversity with the elaboration of typologies is an important stage for the organization of the agricultural development. From the case of dairy farms in Uruar√° municipio, situated on the Transamazonian frontier region, five main types of systems of milk production and theirs trajectories had been identified. Associating these two typologies, it was possible to identify the main dynamics within the diversity of the dairy systems, which represent principal evolutions between groups of farms. The results emphasize the importance of socioeconomics factors for the installation and the development of the dairy production. Inside this context, proposals can be formulated to promote the beginning of the dairy production, its stability and the improvement of the conditions of production.

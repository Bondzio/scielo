This text analyzes the last novel of Argentinean writer Ricardo Piglia, El camino de Ida (Ida's journey), as a presentation of how human experience takes place in contemporaneity. Moreover, if one considers Piglia's oeuvre as an investigation into experience, this novel can be read as a conclusive report of his inquiry.

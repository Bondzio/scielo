This paper retrieves part of the debate developed in the 20th years of the Revista Estudos Feministas Seminar. Some challenges were successful in part, as the visibility of gender and feminist theories in relation to social theory. By other hand, some obstacles still exist, such as the difficult to be admitted into some complex indexing systems, which would make the journals become more respectful. However, this is not specific of feminist publications. As conclusion, I will highlight two of our major challenges: the internationalization of Brazilian academic production and the horizontality of feminist and gender theories, in order to expand the national and disciplinary boundaries.

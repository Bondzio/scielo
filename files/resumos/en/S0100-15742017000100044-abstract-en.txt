Abstract This article analyzes the feminization of journalism in its articulation with the processes of precarization, trivialization, self-employment and professionalization of the career. Based on interviews with journalists from São Paulo as expressed in their discourses, the study examines the axes of differentiation that establish the positions of women and define their perception about such differences. This article aims to both understand how gender hierarchies are structured in the journalism profession and to analyze the differences among women. This is done by means of a sample consisting of professionals with and without children; married, single and divorced; of different generations; acting in various media types; and with different employment relations in the city of São Paulo.

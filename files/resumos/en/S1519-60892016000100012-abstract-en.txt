Abstract: The paper analyses the relation between individual identity and engagement focusing the discussion on the psychosocial processes that are available and support the engagement. The argument is that the identity is an acknowledgement production process that the subject elaborates about himself and others, individually and collectively. In an individual scope, this process involves three identity dimensions: the personal, the social, and the collective dimension. Attuned to the present development of the identity theory which problematize the relation among these different identity dimensions, the present work argues that the militant identity production happens by an identity correspondence process among personal, social and collective dimensions of individual identity.

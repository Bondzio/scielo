The traditional groups of transnational delinquency and their more recently formed homologous ones have quite different relations with the State and with terrorism. In long stablished countries, the more ancient criminal groups were developed along the state organs and depend on the existent institutional and financial structures to move their products and to invest their earnings. These groups also require stable communities and frequently try to contribute to them, while rejecting any contact with terrorist groups.The more recent groups of transnational delinquency have often their origins in post-conflict situations, where there can still be a state of chaos: they are the actors that dominate the clandestine economy. These new groups generate alliances with terrorist organizations because none of the two possess long term financial strategies or political horizons. The destabilizing link between the transnational crime and terrorism are so difficult to attack because the planners of the policies continue considering crime in terms of the traditional paradigms.

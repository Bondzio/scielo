Abstract The article analyses the emergence and the configuration of intermediation in social spaces, taking organizational changes as its departure point. It focuses on social health organizations, responsible for managing some of the public hospitals in SÃ£o Paulo. It emphasizes the reconfiguration that takes place in the hospitals under new management strategies allowing the presence of the so-called &#8220;social organizations&#8221; as intermediaries between the State and the health services beneficiaries. The empirical analysis enables to characterize the performance and configuration of this specific type of intermediary in the Brazilian social space, and enhances the knowledge on intermediation as a more general phenomenon.

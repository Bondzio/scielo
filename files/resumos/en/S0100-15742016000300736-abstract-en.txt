Abstract The way in which student's spatial mobility and performance are disciplined by the different educators in the schools allow us to reflect on the relevance of bodily space produced in the school experience. Each year, multiple spatial boundaries are updated in search of a new balance between opening and closing, distance and proximity, in order to protect and (re)construct adult's territory. The way school space is distributed and invested with meaning is an uncertain and contentious process. In the daily operation of a school, the reflection on this territorial dimension leads us to regard spatial mobility and occupation as important individual, group and institutional resources.

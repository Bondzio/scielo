Three key findings emerged. First, both tomato and lettuce growers    selling to the supermarket market-channel had more human capital than those    not participating. Second, while farm size was important in whether lettuce    growers sell to supermarkets, it was not important for tomato growers. Third,    technology use was significantly more capital-intensive among lettuce growers    selling to the supermarket channels, however, that was generally not the case    for tomato growers. These results are important to agribusiness researchers    and policymakers interested in technology design and research and extension    to enable producers to adapt to the needs of changing agrifood markets, with    new requirements of attributes of products and transactions, which in turn have    implications for technology adoption and human capital investment among growers.    This is particularly pressing in places like Brazil where the market for horticultural    products is changing quickly, conditioned by the rapid rise of supermarkets.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Key words</b>: market channel, produce, supermarkets,    horticulture    <br>   <B>JEL Classification:</b> L2 - Firm Objectives, Organization, and Behavior</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Este artigo analisa as rela&ccedil;&otilde;es    entre a escolha dos canais de distribui&ccedil;&atilde;o dos produtores (enfatizando    distribui&ccedil;&atilde;o por meio de supermercados versus outros canais),    o uso da tecnologia e as caracter&iacute;sticas dos produtores como capital    humano e tamanho da propriedade. Foram identificados tr&ecirc;s resultados principais.    O primeiro revela que produtores de tomate e alface que distribuem por meio    de supermercados apresentaram maior capital humano que aqueles que n&atilde;o    utilizam esse canal. O segundo resultado indica que enquanto o tamanho da propriedade    foi importante para produtores de alface decidirem distribuir por meio de supermercados,    essa vari&aacute;vel n&atilde;o foi importante para produtores de tomate. O    terceiro resultado sugere que o uso da tecnologia foi significativamente mais    intenso em capital entre os produtores de alface que vendem seus produtos para    os supermercados, no entanto, isso n&atilde;o foi observado para produtores    de tomate. Esses resultados s&atilde;o importantes para pesquisadores e formuladores    de pol&iacute;ticas interessados em tecnologia, pesquisa e extens&atilde;o visando    a a&ccedil;&otilde;es que permitam aos produtores se adaptarem &agrave;s necessidades    atuais do mercado.

Introduction</b></font> </p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Supermarkets<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><sup>1</sup></a>    in Brazil, as in other developing countries, have seen a rapid growth in consumer    demand for qualitative attributes such as food quality, safety, variety, healthfulness,    and convenience. At the same time, supermarkets compete on cost with traditional    retailers and with other supermarkets. Chains thus tend to have a dual merchandising    strategy for fresh produce (fruits and vegetables), focusing on low prices for    poorer consumers and quality for richer consumers, and have transformed their    procurement systems to be able to deliver these produce attributes to consumers.    Thus new market channels are emerging&#32;&#150;&#32;with a particular channel defined by    a combination of type of buyer, attribute requirements, and contractual relations    with their suppliers. The investments and practices required of suppliers differ    over the channels, as do the returns and risks. This is because supermarkets    tend to set private standards that differ from public standards, or from the    requirements of informal markets without explicit standards. For example, see    Berdegue et al. (2004) for the case of Central America. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The supermarket sector has grown quickly from    a tiny niche in 1990 to a major and often dominant share of food retail in Latin    America in general (Reardon and Berdegue 2002), and in Brazil in particular    (Farina, 2002). Yet there has as yet been little treatment in the literature    of the domestic market channels to supermarkets in developing countries, in    particular how private standards and other product and transaction requirements    of local supermarkets are transmitted to, and affect local growers. The few    studies that address this issue do so focusing on how developed country retailers    affect developing country farmers, such as US and European quality standards    for horticulture producers in Central America (Thrupp, 1995), or UK supermarket    chains standards on Kenyan and Zimbabwean horticultural producers (Dolan and    Humphrey, 2000, McCulloch and Ota, 2002, Jaffee, 2003, and Henson, Boselie and    Weatherspoon, 2004), or EUREPGAP European retailers collective standards on    developing country producers, such as voor den Dag (2003) for the case of French    beans in Kenya. More generally, research on how changes in market structure    (such as consolidation of the processing or retail sectors) affects technology    adoption by growers, is in incipient stages, with recent contributions such    as that of Heiman, McWilliams, and Zilberman (2000), examining effects of input    agribusiness marketing strategies on growers technology adoption in the U.S.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This paper aims at contributing to filling that    gap in the literature, with a study based on field research in Brazil. After    presenting a taxonomy of market channels, based on distinct sets of requirements    imposed by buyers on suppliers, and thus marketing choices of suppliers, we    address two research questions. (1) What determines the suppliers choice among    those marketing channels? (2) What are the technology implications of the market    channel choice&#32;&#150;&#32;that is, what is the relation between market channel choice    and technology use? The importance of these questions for agribusiness and rural    development is that the analysis reveals requirements and challenges facing    small/medium producers in accessing dynamic markets through modern retailers   &#32;&#150;&#32;and thus informs policy, agricultural research, and development programs in    Brazil and elsewhere. The research questions are addressed by analyzing data    on tomato and lettuce producers in the area supplying S&atilde;o Paulo. The    data come form a survey of 55 tomato and lettuce growers conducted from April-July    2002.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>2. Conceptual Framework</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Retailer demand for food safety and quality attributes    in produce and corresponding efforts by producers to supply produce with these    attributes lead to the emergence of dual supply channels. The first is for what    we can call "conventional attributes" and the other for produce with    "new attributes" (such as higher cosmetic quality and lower pesticide    and bacterial residuals relative to conventional). In this paper we ascribe    demand for the new attributes only to the supermarket market-channel.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Production of the new attributes (such as higher    cosmetic quality and lower pesticide residues than "conventional")    requires of the grower production technology, commercial practices, and investments,    which, in principle, differ from those required to produce conventional attributes.    For example, to produce the "new attributes" required by the supermarket    market-channel, the grower may have to follow an input use regime; specific    production practices that require worker training, such as in pruning and handling    and packing that allow for specific organoleptic or cosmetic quality attributes    in the produce; certification of water quality which in turn requires investments    in and maintenance of the wells and irrigation infrastructure; adoption of good    agricultural practices (GAPs) which imply additional expenditures relative to    conventional such as in reporting; and post-harvest practices and investments    such as in transport and packing crates. These can be thought of as the vector    of technological choices implied by the attribute vector derived from the private    standards for quality and safety of the supermarket chain (Reardon et al. 2001).    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Producing to meet these "new" attribute    requirements presents new risks and costs to suppliersthe costs of making the    necessary investments to comply with the new product standards, and the risks    of failing to meet these standards or opportunistic hold-up on the part of the    buyer. Buyers who seek the "new attributes" must provide growers with    either a price premium or some other boost to revenues or lower risk or both,    relative to returns and risk of conventional market channels, to compensate    them the additional risks and costs incurred in the decision to supply them.    Using the example here of the supermarket-channel, the supermarket specifies    the requirements of the product and the transaction (including the specification    of quality and safety attributes of the produce) and thus, implicitly, the costs    to be incurred above those for the conventional market. The supermarkets then    either offer a price premium relative to "conventional" or they offset    the higher production costs with cost savings elsewhere (such as transaction    costs saved in marketing to few buyers who purchase a large share of the suppliers    total output, and also commit to purchase the product from the supplier thus    reducing the market risk of this channel. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The specification of prices and services and    other transaction terms between all buyers and sellers constitutes a contract.    We use the term "contract" here in the broad sense used by Hueth et    al. (1999), where a contract is a relationship or agreement, written contract    or not, in which there is some penalty implicit or explicit, tangible or intangible    (such as in loss of reputation) in non-compliance. Such contracts are common    in the produce industry (the world over) and applicable in the present case    for the "new attributes" market segment.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The profit-maximization, risk-minimization choices    of a supplier to supply produce with "new attributes" to the supermarket    market-channel, instead of to the conventional market channel, can be characterized    here as a set of recursive choices. (In practice the choices might be recursive    or simultaneous.) The first choice of the grower is the choice of supplying    for (and thus producing for the vector of required product and transaction attributes    of) a given market channel. This is simplified here as a choice between the    supermarket market-channel, versus the conventional market-channel (to traditional    wholesalers). This choice can be modeled in the same way as a technology adoption    choice (Sadoulet and de Janvry, 1995) if modeled as a function of a vector of    output prices (P) (including produce j with new attributes and produce k with    conventional attributes, and other products), vector of input prices (w), vector    of risks (s) (including risk in the supermarket-channel versus the conventional    channel), a vector of quasi-fixed capital other than that specific to the channel    (K) (including human, organization, and physical capital, as well as land, which    can be own or rented), and other shifters (Z): </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) Participation in supermarket market-channel    = f(P, w, <font face="Symbol">s</font>, K, Z)</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second choice of the grower is the choice    of technology. Technology is embodied in variable input use and capital investment    decisions, contingent on choice of marketing channel and thus the vector of    product and transaction attributes required to participate in that channel and    the vector of net returns and risks. The technology choices here are embodied-technology    choices that are hypothesized to differentiate growers producing and delivering    to the buyer produce with "new attributes" by their use of production    and post-harvest equipment such as packing and cleaning equipment, cooling chambers,    refrigerated trucks, and communications equipment (internet, fax, mobile phones).    The embodied-technology choice equations are again adoption equations similar    to (1); in implementation, some of the prices may be 0 because of non-variation:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) Use of embodied-technology j = f(P, w, <font face="Symbol">6</font>,    K, Z) </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>3. Context (Market Channel Characteristics    and Categories)</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this section we identify the relevant categories    for the left-hand side of the adoption equations 1 and 2 presented in the previous    section, that is, the channel and technology choices. To do so, we analyze the    salient characteristics of the Sao Paulo regions tomato and lettuce markets.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Tomato market channels and marketing chain</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tomatoes are produced in the peri-urban area    of S&atilde;o Paulo by farmers who are largely specialized in tomato production,    in some cases producing tomato in rotation with grains. Growers can sell to    wholesalers based in the traditional wholesale market, wholesalers based in    the growing regions, or to several types of intermediaries who purchase tomatoes    to re-sell to wholesalers. The traditional tomato marketing chain, still used    outside the supermarket procurement channel, moves tomatoes from the farms to    packing houses where they are classified and packed into wooden crates, then    to the traditional wholesale market. These wholesalers sell the bulk (on average    48%) of their merchandise to small retailers and fresh processors who visit    the traditional wholesale market to inspect the product and negotiate transactions.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Supermarket Channel moves tomato from growers    to wholesalers that have packing houses in the growing regions and for whom    supermarkets are their primary buyers, responsible for 68% of their sales. Given    supermarkets stringent quality requirements, the intermediaries who supply    them have technologically sophisticated classifying plants (that, for example,    have optical scanners to differentiate tomatoes by color, and pack in plastic    or cardboard boxes that supermarkets prefer). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Growers can thus choose among three marketing    channels: 1) the Traditional Wholesale Channel, 2) the Supermarket Channel,    and 3) and the Intermediary Channel which in turn sells to either the Traditional    Wholesale or Supermarket Channel. The contracts characteristically used for    each type of channel are discussed below.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Intermediary channel with Fixed-price contract</i>.    Growers marketing tomatoes to the Intermediary Channel sell their produce at    the farm-gate to intermediaries who purchase on behalf of wholesalers and classifiers.    Purchase arrangements are made at harvest time, and include transport of the    tomatoes. Prices are discounted slightly to account for the value of the services    provided. These contracts do not offer forward planning of sales, but once a    sales agreement is made (at harvest usually) then payment is immediately made.    The most significant entry barrier is that the Intermediaries seek to purchase    tomato in large volumes, which favors growers who are specialized in tomato    production (rather than those who produce a number of vegetable crops). (Unfortunately,    the nature of data collection did not allow for determination of to what extent    tomato purchased by these intermediaries enters the Traditional vs. Supermarket    channels). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Supermarket Channel with Financing contracts</i>.    Financing contracts involve the provision by the buyer of working capital to    support production on a specific area of land. In exchange, the grower commits    to sell his output from that land to the buyer at harvest. A fixed deduction    per box produced is agreed upon in advance and subtracted upon payment following    harvest. These contracts are offered by classifiers and wholesalers (in combination    with the consignment contract), though the focus here is on financing contracts    offered by classifiers. Entry into these contracts requires one-on-one negotiation    between the classifier and a proven capacity to produce. They are used increasingly    as classifiers increase in number and seek to ensure that they will have adequate    throughput to keep their plants working at efficient levels of throughput. The    contracts are advantageous in that the grower is assured of a buyer for his    harvest. They involve some risk in that the payment is deducted from the final    payment (which is made at going market prices) at a fixed price per box. Thus,    depending on actual output and market prices, the value of the final payment    is difficult to predict (i.e. it will amount to a large payment if the harvest    is very large and prices low, but a small payment if the harvest is small and    prices are high).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Traditional Wholesale Channel with Consignment    contracts</i>. A consignment contract involves the grower sending his product    to an intermediary who then sells it and gives the proceeds to the grower, minus    a marketing commission (of approximately 17%) and various other costs such as    taxes, transport and other explicit fees. These contracts are considered undesirable    by growers, as they are used as a means for intermediaries to shift price risk    to growers, and also because the growers cannot verify the sales price that    the intermediary receives and are thus vulnerable to opportunistic behavior    on the part of the intermediary. There are very low barriers to entry with these    contracts, and many wholesalers will finance the operating costs of the crop.    This market channel is also one of the most accessible to the smallest growers    who, due to their tendency to have diversified crop portfolios, tend to have    small volumes of tomatoes to sell, lessening other buyers interest in them.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Lettuce market channels and marketing chain</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lettuce is produced in the green belt surrounding    metropolitan Sao Paulo by small growers who typically produce a fairly large    mix of products. Growers can sell to a diversity of different buyers including    to intermediaries who buy at the farm gate, small supermarkets, large supermarket    chains, the wholesale market, to processors, and direct to consumers. Most growers    operate individually, but there is also limited participation in marketing cooperatives.    The high perishability of lettuce, lack of a cold chain, and the non-existence    of automated classifying infrastructure make direct sales between growers and    retailers much more common than in the tomato market. Likewise, the traditional    wholesale market plays a relatively minor role, with only 8% of S&atilde;o Paulos    lettuce production passing through the main wholesale market in 1999 (a decline    from 55% in 1990).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Growers can choose among three market channels,    the first two of which are characteristic of traditional channels. These are    1) the Traditional Intermediary Channel which moves the product from the production    area to intermediaries who sell in turn to a variety of small retailers and    to a lesser extent at the traditional wholesale market; 2) The Traditional Small    Retailer Channel which moves lettuce directly from the grower to retailers (without    participation of intermediaries) who come direct to the farm gate; and 3) the    Supermarket Channel, in which lettuce is purchased by Supermarkets directly    from growers, grower associations or firms that perform value-added services    on lettuce that they purchase from growers. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though both involve direct sales between growers    and retailers, the Supermarket Channel has important organizational differences    from the Traditional Small Retailers Channel. Principle among these are that    the growers are responsible for providing a number of services with the lettuce    (such as delivery to individual retail outlets of the large chains) as well    as for meeting stringent product and process standards such as certification    of water quality. The Supermarket Channel is "captained" by the large    retail supermarket and hypermarket chains which set the standards in terms of    product requirements and account for the most movement of produce, however it    also includes the small and medium-sized supermarkets, particularly those oriented    to higher income clienteles and who seek to provide many higher-quality attributes.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lettuce contracts do not show the wide diversity    that are characteristics of tomato contracts, with neither the consignment nor    the financing contracts in evidence. Instead, a variety of Fixed Price contracts    exist. The Supermarket Channel contract is a Fixed Price Contract with High    Service Requirements. The Intermediary and Small Retailer Channels both rely    on Fixed Price Contracts with Low Service Requirements, but differ in terms    of negotiation and pricing methods. The characteristics of these contracts are    summarized below.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Supermarket Channel with Fixed price contracts    and high service requirements</i>. Supermarket Channel buyers are very demanding    of their suppliers in terms of the provision of both physical services and services    to guarantee the quality and safety of their products. Physical services sought    include product packaging, transport of the product, and delivery among individual    stores. Quality and safety assurance services include water quality certification,    HACCP, and Good Agricultural and Manufacturing Practices. It is interesting    to note that only the largest chains require these quality and safety services    (as opposed to all the firms that seek but do not explicitly require the services).    However, the fact that a producer qualifies on these fronts to sell to the large    chains is an important point in gaining access to the smaller high-end supermarkets    that generally do not require them explicitly. These are fixed price contracts;    however, unlike the Low Service Fixed Price contracts, the supplier has some    degree of bargaining power, and often provides the retailer with a price table    on which negotiation is based. These contracts have high entry barriers, particularly    investments in advanced post-harvest practices, investments to meet certification    requirements, transport and communications. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Intermediary Channel with Fixed price contract    and low service requirements. </i>These contracts involve the provision of less    service by the supplier. In many cases, the product is collected at the farm    gate on a regular basis. Ongoing long-term relationships between buyer and seller    predominate. Given the highly variable quality of lettuce and the lack of enforceable    grades and standards, personal relationships and negotiation are important.    The above characterization is also true for the <I>Small Retailer Channel with    Fixed price contract and low service requirements.</I></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>4. Empirical Model, Hypotheses, Methods and    Data</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Data</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The data used come from a survey of retailers,    intermediaries and farmers from April to July 2002. Fifty-five farmers (32 lettuce    growers and 23 tomato growers) in the peri-urban region of Sao Paulo were interviewed.    The sample was chosen as a "judgement sample" (<A HREF="http://www.statpac.com/surveys/sampling.htm" target="_blank">www.statpac.com/surveys/sampling.htm</A>);    the main producing areas of lettuce and tomato (for the Sao Paulo market) were    identified, and extension agents as key informants were used to identify the    sample of growers, maximizing representation of characteristics. Data was collected    on farming activities and resources, and trends in these over the past five    years. Additionally, a survey of 15 tomato intermediaries was conducted, nine    located in the traditional wholesale market in Sao Paulo and six (with their    own processing facilities) in the peri-urban area.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Market Channel Choice</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Using the market channel categories identified    in section 3 as a starting point, an empirical analysis was made of growers    participation in market channels and the specific composition of these market    channels. We used cluster analysis of the market outlets that growers reported    using. Partitional cluster analysis techniques using the k-means algorithm and    within group average measures to minimize the squared Euclidean distances of    all points between clusters were used to differentiate the market channels to    which growers belong. The mean points of the clusters generalize the market-channel    choices of the growers, with the growers selection of the channel determined    by the growers characteristics (in particular, the K vector in equation 1,    because the P and w vectors do not vary in the cross section analysis over the    limited geographical scope of the peri-urban area. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The growers characteristics variables used in    the cluster analysis, representing determinants of market channel choice, are    outlined below. Note that in general, given the incentive to produce for the    supermarket channel (price premium and lower risk through contract), the main    determinants are the capacities to meet the supermarket requirements which are    communicated directly or via a wholesaler buying for the supermarket. These    requirements include, as noted in section 3, consistent delivery of high quality    produce which implies having equipment and skills. The specific correlates and    our hypotheses of their relation to the supermarket channel choice are as follows.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, we hypothesize that larger the farm, the    greater the probability that the grower will be in the supermarket channel cluster.    It is commonly assumed, for example by policymakers designing agricultural diversification    programs, that fruit and vegetable production displays no economies of size    or scale&#32;&#150;&#32;and thus mere labor intensity (which it is assumed that small growers    can supply in abundance) is sufficient to be competitive in fruit and vegetable    production for urban markets. But, as signaled by Cook (2004), fruit and vegetable    production systems that consistently produce quality and sufficient volumes    for supermarkets are technology-, capital-, non-labor input-, information system-    and infrastructure (packaging, pre-cooling, cold chain management)-intensive,    and meeting these requirements involves economies of size. Moreover, evidence    from elsewhere (such as Berdegue et al. 2004) suggests that supermarkets and    specialized/dedicated wholesalers have a predilection, all else equal, to source    from medium/large farmers in order to reduce the number of suppliers and thus    transaction costs.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana"> Second, other assets that we hypothesize    to be important in participating in the supermarket market-channel include human    capital (reflected by own-education, use of skilled labor, and specialization    in horticulture in farming operations), reliance on off-farm sources of income    to serve as risk management mechanisms to balance the initial risk of selling    to a non-traditional market and also to provide finance for operations, and    access to finance for working and investment capital </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Specialization in agriculture is measured by    the share of individual growers family budgets from agriculture; the share    of their agricultural income from vegetables, and the number of different vegetables    produced. Specialization in the production of "high-value" products    includes specialty produce such as organic, hydroponic, pre-packaged, greenhouse-grown    and pre-processed produce. The employment of skilled labor is proxied using    the share of total employees who are permanent on the farm, either as hired    or family labor. Have access to financing for operational and investment expenses    is reflected by growers use of different sources of operational and investment    capital, including banks, special government programs such as PRONAF and FINAME,    input suppliers, business associates and family and friends. The level of education    in agricultural pursuits is indicated by growers completion of specialized    educational programs in agriculture, either at the university (such as an agronomy    degree) or technical schools.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, the use of modern production practices,    such as regular employment of soil analysis, is expected to be correlated with    participation in supermarket market-channels. Growers market-oriented management    practices are indicated by the extent to which they purchase key inputs from    the market, specifically whether they have a greenhouse to produce their own    seedlings or rely on the market for these.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Note that the use of cluster analysis allows    us not to assume strict causality, but rather general relationships, and hence    obviates the need to have only exogenous variables among the above correlates.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Technology Choice</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Technology use was analyzed in two manners. First,    cluster analysis was used to separate growers into high and low technology groups.    Here within-group averages were minimized using Jaccard measures, drawing on    growers dichotomous responses regarding their use of specific post-harvest,    transportation, communications and value-added (for lettuce only) technologies    (Tan et al.). The resulting clusters were then matched with growers participation    in different market channels using cross-tabs with chi-square tests for statistical    significance. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, indices were created based on growers    possession of specific equipment (the same equipment analyzed in the cluster    analysis). Growers possession of different equipment was then analyzed with    respect to their market channel participation using comparison of means with    analysis of variance to determine the statistical significance of the results.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The technology variable is modeled as dichotomous,    reflecting that a grower either has a package of needed equipment and other    components that are necessary for producing the requirements of the supermarket    channel, or does not. The choice is thus between traditional and "advanced"    technology, where "advanced" equipment and infrastructure includes    transportation, post-harvest communications, and value-added technologies. Specific    equipment included open, closed and refrigerated trucks for transportation and    delivery of produce; plastic crates, vegetable washers, and cold storage rooms    for post-harvest technologies; computer and internet access for communications,    and greenhouses and pre-processing infrastructure for value-added technology.    Again, the choice of correlates focused on grower characteristics (the same    set as used in the market channel choice cluster analysis) because of the lack    of variation in prices in this cross section over a limited geographic area.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>5.  Results and Discussion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Cluster analysis results of market channel    choice</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Tomatoes.</i> Cluster analysis of tomato growers    marketing decisions (summarized in <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>) revealed consistent    patterns of participation in the three market channels&#32;&#150;&#32;the Modern Classifier    channel (the most direct to the supermarket), the Intermediary Channel, and    the Traditional Wholesale Channel. Around 75% of the growers sold to the Intermediary    Channel, only 5% sold to the Modern Classifier Channel, and the rest (20%) sold    to the Traditional Wholesale Market Channel. </font></p>     <p><a name="tab01"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p ALIGN="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n3/a07tab01.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="#tab02">Table 2</a> reports results    on the tomato grower characteristic correlates of market channel choice. As    hypothesized, participants in the Supermarket Channel are more likely to use    more skilled labor (controlling for land), and have higher levels of specialized    education (Technical School), as compared to those participating in the other    channels. It is interesting that farm size did not have a significant effect   &#32;&#150;&#32;whereas physical capital and skills to produce quality and consistency do    matter. Furthermore, the use of greenhouses for production of seedlings was    higher for growers in the Supermarket Market-Channel than for others. Given    the importance of quality in producing for the Supermarket Market-Channel, it    is possible then that one of the ways that growers ensure high quality is by    vertical integration of some of the key activities that determine the quality    of the productsuch as the production of seedlings. </font></p>     <p><a name="tab02"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p ALIGN="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n3/a07tab02.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Lettuce</i>. Cluster analysis of lettuce growers    marketing choices (summarized in <a href="#tab03">Table 3</a>) also showed consistent    patterns of participation in three market channels. Twenty-five percent of the    growers sold to the Supermarket Channel, which was comprised of large supermarket    and hypermarket chains and small and medium-sized supermarkets. Another 25%    of the growers sold to a Small Retail Channel, comprised primarily of small    non-supermarket retailers such as street fair vendors and discount green grocers.    The remaining 50% sold to an Intermediary Channel. P-values show that each market    channel has statistically different levels of sales to different types of buyers    except for sales to the wholesale market and processors and consumers.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab03"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p ALIGN="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n3/a07tab03.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="#tab04">Table 4</a> reports results    on the lettuce grower characteristic correlates of market channel choice. It    shows a consistent pattern of results in which the relatively more attractive    market channels are used by growers who are more specialized in agriculture,    produce a broader array of products, have larger farms, and for whom the production    of high-value "specialty" produce constitutes a larger portion of    the revenue of those who produce it. These growers also rely very heavily on    skilled laborers (86% of their total compared to only 8% for the other groups),    are younger, and have highly specialized training in agriculture as evidenced    by 43% of the Supermarket Channel growers having university educations in agriculture    compared to none of the other growers. Interestingly, while Supermarket Channel    growers are not the most reliant on outside sources of capital for operational    expenses (though only half of the growers selling to Small Retailer Traditional    Channel rely on outside capital for their operational expenses), those Supermarket    Market-Channel growers who do borrow for operational expenses are extended credit    for approximately twice as long as the other growers.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab04"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n3/a07tab04.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Why does farm size matter for lettuce growers    but not for tomato growers? We surmise that the reason is based on the structure    of the marketing channel. All tomatoes pass through mechanized classification    plants. However, there is no mechanized classification of lettuce, and a large    proportion of it moves directly from producers to retailers. Thus, the classifiers    play two roles in the tomato markets that they do not play in lettuce markets.    First, they aggregate the production of numerous tomato growers in order to    meet demand. Second, they perform most of the operations that qualify tomatoes    for the Supermarket Market-Channels. That is, though it is crucial for tomato    coming into the plant to be of high quality, the value-added operations on the    tomato such as sorting, packaging and transport, take place at the plant. Thus,    there is no inherent scale advantage for tomato growers to sell to the Supermarket    Market-Channel buyers. In fact, given the increasing number of classifiers in    the area and competition for adequate volumes of throughput to meet demand and    keep plants running at efficient capacity levels, it is likely that the classifier-intermediaries    do not currently seek to purchase tomato from large-scale growers exclusively.    In contrast to this situation for tomato, the proportion of sales of lettuce    direct from the grower to the retail buyer means that the services and attributes    that make lettuce qualify for the Supermarket Market-Channel frequently take    place at the farm level. Furthermore, Supermarket Market-Channel buyers tend    to require a minimum variety of produce (such as different varieties of lettuce    or value-added features) as well as a minimum volume, which creates a bias towards    larger growers.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Results of technology use analysis</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As shown in <a href="#tab05">Tables 5</a> and    <a href="#tab06">6</a>, there were no statistically significant differences    between tomato growers in the different market channels in terms of their technology    use, in terms of embodied-technology reflected in the equipment use shown. The    explanation for this lack of statistically significant difference in technology    use also lies in the structure of the marketing chain. Again, it is key that    a grower producing for the Supermarket Market-Channel be able to produce a high    quality tomato, but given the importance of classifiers in the activities that    qualify the tomato for the Supermarket Market-Channel, it does not turn out    to be crucial for the grower to possess these technologies.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab05"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n3/a07tab05.gif"></p>     <p><a name="tab06"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n3/a07tab06.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By contrast, <a href="#tab07">Table 7</a> shows    that there are sharp differences in technology use among lettuce growers, over    the market channels. Among lettuce growers, 100% of those selling to the Supermarket    Channel are in the "high technology group", compared to 69% of the    Intermediary Channel growers, and only 38% of the Small Retailer Channel growers.    This pattern is as one would expect given the production and post-harvest requirements    of the different channels.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab07"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n3/a07tab07.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="#tab08">Table 8</a> shows that Supermarket    Channel lettuce growers scored ranked significantly higher than any of the Traditional    market channel growers in the possession of post-harvest equipment, advanced    delivery equipment, access to communications equipment, and value-added equipment.    Interestingly, with the exception of access to communications equipment (for    which Intermediary Channel growers rated almost three times as high as Small    Retail Channel growers), there was little difference, on average, in the different    Traditional Market Channel growers ratings on indices for equipment possession    in these categories.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab08"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n3/a07tab08.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are two important implications of these    results for tomato growers. First, they point to the key role that intermediaries    play in the tomato market channels in facilitating the access of heterogeneous    growers to the Supermarket Market-Channel. Second, they point to the importance    of the human capital dimension in determining the access of growers to the Supermarket    Market-Channelwhile there are clear differences in the characteristics of tomato    growers producing for the different market channels, these differences are not    easily attributable to differences in their technology holdings or size. Instead    it is crucial that the tomato growers who participate in the Supermarket Market-Channel    be able to produce quality, but the results indicate that the ability to produce    quality is more a function of their having skilled labor and specialized educations    (i.e. the human capital dimension) than their using specific equipment portfolios.    For lettuce growers, however, the situation is very differentlike tomato, the    human capital element is crucial. Unlike tomato growers, however, lettuce growers    need to have access to specific advanced technologies and be of sufficient size    to participate effectively in the Supermarket Market-Channel.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>6. Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This paper examined the relationships between    growers choice of market channel (emphasizing the supermarket market-channel    versus others), technology use, and grower characteristics such as human capital    and farm size. Three key findings emerged. First, both tomato and lettuce growers    selling to the supermarket market-channel had more human capital than those    not participating. Second, while farm size was important in whether lettuce    growers sell to supermarkets, it was not important for tomato growers. While    the latter was expected due to hypothesized economies of size, the latter was    surprising until one notes that the role of specialized/dedicated wholesalers    is far more important in intermediating tomato growers (as opposed to lettuce    growers) access to supermarket channels. The wholesalers thus classify, grade    and bulk from many smaller growers and deliver to supermarkets, while in the    lettuce channel larger, well-equipped growers deliver that service and sell    directly to supermarkets. Third, technology use was significantly more capital-intensive    among lettuce growers selling to the supermarket channels, as hypothesized given    the product and transaction attributes demanded by the supermarkets. However,    that was not the case for tomato growers, except to note the greater importance    of greenhouses for quality-seedling production. Again, the explanation lies    in the intermediation point noted above.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These results are important to agribusiness researchers    and policymakers interested in technology design and research and extension    to enable producers to adapt to the needs of changing agrifood markets, with    new requirements of attributes of products and transactions, which in turn have    implications for technology adoption and human capital investment among growers.    This is particularly pressing in places like Brazil where the market for horticultural    products is changing fast, conditioned by the rapid rise of supermarkets. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>7.

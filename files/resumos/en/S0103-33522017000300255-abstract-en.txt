Abstract The review presents an alternative model to explain the recurring crises between State branches in Latin America after the "third wave of democracy." Inspired on bargains theories of war between countries, Gretchen Helmke, in her book Institutions on the edge: the origins and consequences of inter-branch crises in Latin America, shows that attacks from one branch against another are the consequence of political calculations based on asymmetric information and on the lack of trust between agents when it comes to agreements and commitments. The impeachment of a president is an example of this.

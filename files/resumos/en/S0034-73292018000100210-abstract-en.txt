Abstract This article analyzes the effects of European Union Public Diplomacy (EUPD) discourses, drawing on poststructuralist approaches, which emphasize the productive dimension of discourse. We argue that EUPD helps reproduce a hierarchized identity of the EU, which authorizes particular courses of action while limiting others. Through an analysis of EUPD documents, we identify three descriptors - &#8220;EU as a zone of peace, prosperity and democracy&#8221;; &#8220;United in Diversity&#8221;; and &#8220;EU as a model&#8221; &#8211; which, together, form a meaningful narrative about EU&#8217;s identity, infused with moral superiority, and constitute a dominant discourse with political effects internally and externally.

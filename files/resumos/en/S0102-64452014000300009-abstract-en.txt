The paper conducts an analysis about two collectives of queer activism from Portugal and Chile. After summarizing the history of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) movements and their main achievements, especially regarding legal frameworks, the article presents and analyses the queer activism conducted by the groups Panteras Rosa and the Coletivo Universitário de Dissidência Sexual (CUDS). The objective is, by demonstrating how these groups differentiate themselves from and clash against the LGBT movement, to indicate the main characteristics of such activism in these countries.

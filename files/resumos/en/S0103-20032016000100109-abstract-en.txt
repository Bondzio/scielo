Abstract: The increasing use of the territorial approach in the process of public policy design in Brazil has stimulated a series of studies about this theme. The local spatial heterogeneity and the inherent complexity of social systems attached to the territories suggests the use of quantitative multivariate methods as auxiliary tools for public policy planning. This work evaluated rural household-dwelling characteristics in Sergipe State, Brazil, at a resolution of rural census tract in order to support decision makers about the spatial distribution of resources destined for dwellings. It has been analyzed three regional partitions: municipalities, Territories of Citizenship and Territories of State's Planning, using demographic census data from 2010. The study has been conducted by using factorial analysis and clustering techniques. Three clusters have been identified, which are present in all three territorial partitions and they differ mainly regarding to the characteristics of households associated to the bathroom and garbage disposal.

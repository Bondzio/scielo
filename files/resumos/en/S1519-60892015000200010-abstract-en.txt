This reflection necessarily involves a discussion of the notion of the person as a whole individual, where there is no visible boundary between nature and culture. How the notion of person is build is verifiable in the way the body is shaped during pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum. This article it was used the ethnographic research method by the focus in social practices. Accordingly, the forming the body is analyzed, assuming this is something which can be molded, dynamic and vital flows, integrated in the cycles of life and the environment (where there is no visible boundary between nature and culture). It is important to conclude that in Ribeira da Barca one is relational, occurs within a relationship with others and with oneself.

Abstract Population aging and dependency in old age are two important social challenges which have led to the creation of new occupations, jobs, and professions. The aim of this article is to analyze how the profession of 'caregiver of the elderly' is being shaped in Brazil. Based on a content analysis of Bill 4.702/2012 (aimed at regulating the profession of elderly caregiver), in-depth interviews with caregivers, experts, and caregivers' rights activists, as well as direct observations in training courses, the article explores the arenas of conflict that emerge from the construction of caregivers of the elderly as a profession.

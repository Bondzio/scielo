In this article, the political philosopher Susan Moller Okin discusses the dichotomy public-private from a gendered perspective. Overlooking gender - especially as it assumes the form of overlooking the political reality of the family and gender 'neutral' language - has become, in many past and present authors, a reinforcement of that dichotomy, silencing about its patriarchal nature. As Okin understands it, domestic (personal) sphere and non-domestic (public) sphere can not be interpreted isolatedly, what demands a deep revision of the base of most liberal political theory. The author faces this demand, discussing important problems such as the value of privacy.

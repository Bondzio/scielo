Abstract Discuss the nature of police reform, understood here not as any innovation within the police force but as a certain rate of change (high visibility as opposed to its previous opacity, role of actors outside police in front of its traditional corporatism, mainstreaming political issues in contrast to his &#8220;apolitical&#8221; insertion into globalized networks that instigate changes) and a set of mutations focused on bureaucratic and political aspects. We describe the experience of police reform initiated in Venezuela in 2006 and that despite the unique characteristics of its context, faithfully replicates many of the dimensions that are repeated in different processes and holding instances on moving globalized police. Finally, we try to briefly explain how it could be this reform process in Venezuela and explore the reasons for its possible failure.

The study focuses on work as a path toward personal realization, in the case of compulsory education teachers, as a starting-point for their training. Teaching, a job seen as easy, actually involves a great many difficulties, reflected as challenges to the training of future teachers. Some of these challenges are examined, as is the contribution of authors such as NÃ³voa, Saviani, Tardif, Lessard, Dubet, Vincent, and Labaree, who have studied the topic, seeking to focus on the real work done by teachers as an inspiration for teacher education. Teacher education, today a responsibility of universities, is marked by a strong accent on the theoretical aspect, while practice comes a distant second. Attention to the work carried out by teachers may help bring teacher education closer to the needs of future teachers. This is why an effective partnership between the two teacher-educating institutions, universities and schools, needs urgently to be built.

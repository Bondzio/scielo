This article presents the findings which emerged from a research about the male participation in household tasks, in the family daily activities and in infants care. The procedures in this research included both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The first step (qualitative) consisted of exploratory interviews and debates with groups of males receiving a family income below 5 minimum wages that had children of 14 years of age or younger, by means of focus groups. In the second step (quantitative), we studied secondary information about the male participation in the "household tasks" and the time spent in those activities by means of data extracted from the PNAD/IBGE database of 2006.

Abstract: In 2017, Revista Estudos Feministas completed 25 years of publication. Its 10, 15 and 20 years as an academic journal created and edited by women's groups linked to teaching, research and feminist activism have yielded many texts in commemorative editions. REF, the result of a voluntary collective work, &#8220;is an indexed, interdisciplinary journal of national and international circulation, the mission of which is to publish articles, essays and reviews that present consistent and innovative theoretical reflections (...) broadening the frontiers of academic debates in the field of feminist and gender studies and implementing the practices of women's movements&#8221;. The 25th anniversary of REF provides us with a new opportunity to reflect on its editing processes, on the themes of the articles, essays, dossiers and debates produced, as well as on the geographical places and disciplinary formations of their authors, with their diversified epistemological affiliations, now supported by a database that has been organized on the magazine.

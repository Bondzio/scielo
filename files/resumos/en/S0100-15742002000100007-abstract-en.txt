This article presents the experience of implementing the environmental education curriculum for young students living around the Parque SÃ£o Bartolomeu. This park is an important natural and historical site located in the suburbs of Salvador, Bahia. The objective of the study was to investigate the influence of teacher's system of representation about environmental education. It was observed that teachers rethink the curriculum according with their representations and values and that the learning process of students was affected by the teacher's collective representations about nature, human's relationship with nature and the pedagogical process.

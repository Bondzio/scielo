ABSTRACT This study focuses on the differences between the messages of curricular materials for teachers of Mathematics and the messages of pedagogical practices that they use. For this, we use secondary data from the observation of two pedagogical practices, in which a current teacher and a future teacher use these materials. Interview data were also brought into consideration. The analysis suggests that curricular materials for teachers that illustrate only one message of pedagogical practice don&#8217;t show the conflicts with other messages. Therefore, curricular material for teachers should communicate different messages in order to give visibility to the scope of contextual realizations.

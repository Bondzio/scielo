ABSTRACT The article emphasizes that, in addition to the presence of sociology within different national societies, in the last decades the creation of a transnational space for the production of sociology took place. The emergence of this transnational space of sociology presents an asymmetric power structure, due to the unequal distribution of material and symbolic resources between countries. It underlines the importance of using a reflexive sociology, which calls for a constant reflection on the historical, social, institutional and academic conditions that are present in the production of sociological knowledge, able to elucidate the complex relationship between this new transnational space of discipline and the various national sociologies.

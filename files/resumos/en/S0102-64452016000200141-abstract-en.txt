Abstract This article analyzes the "glocal" public health issue related to the production, distribution, and use of asbestos. The evidence regarding the harm of this mineral to the health and environment justifies the national and global prohibitions of its use. However, the strength of economic interests regarding asbestos' great exploration by companies encourages many states to maintain the policy of controlled use. Since in involves the violation of human rights, the issue was an object of judicialization in some countries, such as Brazil, France and Italy, whose comparative observation highlights the asymmetry of responses.

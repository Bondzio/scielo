Abstract: This paper aims to analyze the relation between law and norm in the context of Lacan's appropriation of structural anthropology, particularly its theoretical consequences on sexual identification processes. The limits of the formalization of Oedipus complex are discussed, as well as Lacan's universal aspiration of the symbolic. We undertake an alternative reading of The elementary structures of kinship to show the central role given by LÃ©vi-Strauss to culture and local norms variations. Considering this, the paper concludes that the formation of groups and a politics of alliances may guide a new conception of gender identification processes.

The purpose of this article is to discuss the way of pacification policies from the impacts in Baixada Fluminense in terms of sociability and representations in the trajectory of residents belonging to an evangelical church and a neighborhood association. Argument from the field research, we can understand the reconfiguration of state practices in their margins and legibility of control policies directed to the poor and vulnerable, not only from the slums and their representations. Take the Baixada Fluminense from its specific constitution, the intertwining of political market and violence on one side and its relational aspect with Rio de Janeiro, on the other, may lead us to better understand these different territorial regimes caused by the pacification policies.

This article intends to discuss from the point of view of school and curriculum, globalization and identity as two position spaces that concretely configure the education politics at the level of the school organization. We defend that the globalization contributes in an effective way not only for the reinforcement of the school homogenization, including the curriculum practices, but also for the reinforcement of the curriculum concept as a fact. This view is, consequently, against what the construction of the school identity presupposes. The results presented here are concerned with the practices of elaboration of educational projects (political-pedagogical ones). It was found that the teachers develop some of these projects according to a normative logic and following a ritual whose aim is to implement macro-decision. This is done even in name of schools' autonomy and/or the constitution of the identity of local curriculum.

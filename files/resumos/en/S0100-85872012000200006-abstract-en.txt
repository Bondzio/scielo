The paper analyzes the different ways by which relationships between social actors that define themselves as Jews, and institutions of the Jewish Field, take shape. Taking part in the discussion about Orthodoxy revival, its objective is to explain how social actors relate to the Jewish space. In doing so, analyze a group of individuals that relate to Orthodoxy from the institutional periphery. Taking into account the path of the social actors, we can observe that the process of Orthodoxy revival can be analyzed with regard to decomunitarization experiences.

This article tries to give an outline of the peasant imaginary universe of the so called &#8220;rural frontier&#8221; of Brazilian Oriental Amazonia. Being migrants after a series of expulsions from their land, these peasants take with them their mythes and legends, creating new ones when they need explanations about their everyday world. It is in this last sense that the author sees the versions about the &#8220;Araguaia Guerrilla&#8221;, collected in the Pr&#233;-Amaz&#244;nia Maranhense area, an armed struggle that opposed militants of the Partido Comunista do Brasil (PC do B) and the Brazilian army of the military government period at the beginning of the 1970 years.

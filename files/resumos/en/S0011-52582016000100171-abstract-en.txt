ABSTRACT The State coup consumed in Argentina in 1976 was the result of an extensive conspiracy which involved significant fractions of the local bourgeoisie. This article intends to discuss this under-analyzed problem, reconstructing the coup offensive initiated in 1975. After analyzing the political positions, the actions of protests and the political ties of several groups and businesses corporations with the military, the text demonstrates that the Armed Forces did not operate alone in carrying out the coup &#8211; on the contrary, they were a tool used by a wide-ranging social alliance organized to this end.

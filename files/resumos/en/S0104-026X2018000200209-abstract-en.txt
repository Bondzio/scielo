Abstract: This study analyzes the effects of gender relations on the social trajectories of homeless people who identify themselves as lesbian and gay in the city of Florianopolis/SC. The research was developed in the months of January and February of 2016, with social constructionist posture. Individual interviews and records from the participant observation were conducted with homeless LGBT. Conflicts and family violence stemming from gender phobias, marked by heteronormativity, were the main reason for lesbian and gay going to street. However, previous socioeconomic aspects appear as determining factors for the street to be chosen. Despite the constant violence on the street, for reasons that go beyond gender identity, all the narratives pointed out that the current space is a better place to follow their lives when compared to the previous scenarios.

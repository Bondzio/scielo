During the last decades, the Argentine agricultural sector has been characterized by a rapid and profound technological transformation. The main goal of this paper is to foster a discussion about the social impacts of technological change in the southern and eastern regions of the province of Cordoba focusing, in particular, on its repercussions on farm women and their role in agriculture. Based on an ecofeminist perspective, this study presents empirical evidence about various aspects related to population, employment and welfare. Our main conclusions show that, in spite of the remarkable development achieved by the agricultural sector, the position of Cordoba farm women does not seem to have been promoted or strengthened, since, in general, rural women continue to be relegated to a secondary role and categorized as 'farmer's wives'.

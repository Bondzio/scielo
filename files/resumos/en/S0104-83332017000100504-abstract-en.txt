Abstract Based on my ethnography with the Jarawara, an Arawá speaking people of the Middle Purus river, the article aims to think about the girls&#8217; end of reclusion party, the mariná, and its effects on the composition of a &#8220;takeable&#8221; agent. The idea developed here is that the &#8220;somnolence&#8221; (nokobisa), the &#8220;tiredness&#8221; (mama) and the &#8220;beauty&#8221; (amosa) are forms of ritual actions that aim to draw out of the women&#8217;s bodies their capacities of &#8220;being takeable&#8221; (towakama), of &#8220;being carriable&#8221; (weyena). Those qualities would also be associated with the shamans, that after consuming rapé (a tobacco based powder) are carried on the back of their plant-children and experience relations with a variety of beings in the neme (the &#8220;upper layer&#8221;) &#8211; beings which they meet in their dreams as well. I will try to think how a certain notion of jarawara women agency may be linked to the oneiric activity and to the shaman&#8217;s knowledge.

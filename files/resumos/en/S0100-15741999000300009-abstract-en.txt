This article presents the results of a study on the training that the Course for Teacher Qualification at the Secondary Level has been providing to future teachers for interacting with students who are ethnically and racially different. Training is understood here as the opportunity to discuss themes that provide for future teachers materials to reflect on the issues of ethnic and racial relations, and above all, as a means to enable them to transmit an attitude of respect for racial and cultural difference. To this end, three dimensions of the course were focussed upon: curriculum, didactic books in four disciplines and the professors who teach these materials. The treatment given to the theme in a magazine for teachers, also used in the training courses, was studied as well.

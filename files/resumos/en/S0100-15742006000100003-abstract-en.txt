The purpose of this article is to study the relationship between self-esteem and the acts of physical and psychological violence that arise in school. It provides results a research carried out both in public and private schools in São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro State. An epidemiological survey with a sample of 1,686 students was used with 7th and 8th grade elementary and 1st and 2nd grade secondary school students. As pointed out by the results, for those students with a low self-esteem it seems to be more difficult to get along both with classmates and teachers than for those with a high self-esteem. Not to mention that more often than the others the former pose as victims of violence at school and find it more difficult to feel at home there. This paper addresses some Brazilian programs which have been attempting to approach the issue of violence at school.

Abstract: Over the last years, the production of Brazilian broiler increased by 112%, pushing up exports sharply. This excellent performance has settled Brazil as the largest exporter and third largest producer of broiler. Thousands of producers and hundreds of processing and exporting companies represent this sector. Its organization, use of technology and management skills have been an example of success for other meat chains. This success resulted from technological innovations, as well as the use of an efficient system of Research and Development (R&amp;D). This article aims to analyze the R&amp;D process in the production chain of Brazilian broiler, especially the stages of production and industrialization. A search had been carried out with the use of semi-structured questionnaires with professionals in the production and industrialization areas. The results showed that most of the surveyed companies has its own structure of R&amp;D and develop research more strongly directed to the development of products or processes, some more intensively, looking for technological innovations, and others just test products already developed. A positive fact is that public institutions, such as universities and PRIs (Public Research Institutes), are important partners in this process, which demonstrates confidence in these institutions, as well as a concern to maximize physical, human and financial resources.

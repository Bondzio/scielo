This study aims to measure the labor and land net productivity in Brazil, major regions and federation units. It also identifies the factor that affects productiveness based on data provided by theCensus of Agriculture 2006, from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Thus, the productiveness may not be uniform in Brazilian agriculture due to the diversity in each region and differences related to the structure of productivity. The multiple linear regression models were used to identify factors that affect agriculture production and performance in Brazil. As a result, the best production index, which is related to labor and land productivity, is located in the South and Southeast Brazil. Some of the highest values are mainly concentrated only in some regions. Afterwards, an overall analysis of the figures indicated that the agricultural input and mechanization have presented a positive agricultural participation in most Brazilian states.

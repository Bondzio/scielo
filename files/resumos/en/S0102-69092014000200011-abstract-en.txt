In order to contribute to studies aiming at capturing the diversity of the phenomenon of association, this article seeks to reclaim some of the main theoretical contributions that, in varied forms, put the "art of association" as a central element for thinking about processes of democratization of societies. Emphasis is given to three analytical perspectives that reveal certain features of democratic associations, represented by the concepts of social capital, social movements, and civil society. In dialogue with the analysis of Warren (2001) about the 'democratic ecology of associations', the work suggests the gains that, despite some inconsistencies, would result from the combination and incorporation of these different positions in dealing with the diversity and complexity of the associative field in contemporary societies.

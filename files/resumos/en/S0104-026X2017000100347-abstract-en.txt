Abstract: This article is based on considerations about the limits and potentialities in the production of solidarity, through reciprocal recognition, in social interactions mediated by technology, involving mainly trans activists. Based on concepts of symbolic interactionism in face-to-face social interactions, I regard the conflicts present in political interactions on the internet and the transformation of &#8220;potential allies&#8221; into &#8220;enemies&#8221; or &#8220;adversaries&#8221; in the political struggle. In this analysis, I try to understand the political-academic exchanges involving categories such as &#8220;subalternity&#8221; and &#8220;intersectionality&#8221; in order to enter the delicate debate about the greater or lesser appreciation of political positions based on the &#8220;standpoint&#8221; of the subject and of his or her interlocutor.

Abstract This paper discusses the differences between two dimensions present in human representations of nature: the ecological sensitivity, ie, human feelings and perceptions about nature; and environmentalism, a global movement built historically, which is multifaceted, scattered across various areas, and is dedicated to the protection and management of natural and human environment. The goal is to analyze the historicity of these dimensions, considering the views of some of its supporters and critics. The discussion, finally, enables to understand human relationship with nature as a problem that is both historical and ethical-moral.

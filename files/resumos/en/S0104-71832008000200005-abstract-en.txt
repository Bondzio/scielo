This work analyzes the meanings given to violent actions by the members of argentine football fans groups (hinchada) through the category of aguante. These are part of a "way of being" that both defines and distinguishes them, and constitutes a complex system of honour and prestige that valorates positively the courage, the bravery and the surrending in a physical confrontation. From a simplistic and stigmatizing analysis, like the one of the media and the common sense, these actors and their practices are conceived as "violent" because they execute and give a positive value to different actions that are beyond the "acceptable". However, and paradoxically, there are moral principles that define what is allowed and what is forgiven, the fair and the unfair in a violent act. Discovering and analyzing these limits allows us to study the constitution of a social space where these practices are accepted, and also to analyze the relationships with another actors that are beyond that space but are related with the members of the hinchada; that means they also "negociate" their moral code with the actors outside their boundaries.

The purpose of this study is to discuss the contribution of recent studies for understanding the conditions that make extended learning paths possible in low-income segments. The meticulous analysis of its results and an interview with a student of a highly selective higher education course from this background enables us to raise some issues. The review of some studies on the subject evidencing the central role of the family in extended learning paths also enables us to question some of the meanings commonly assigned to extended learning in low-income segments, such as conformism, suffering, and cultural disruption. The need for further investigation on the role of school, as well as on the existence of other meanings related to school access and the experience of poor students in higher education courses has been made evident.

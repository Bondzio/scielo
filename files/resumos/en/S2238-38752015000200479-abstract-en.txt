Abstract The military coup of April 25, 1974 was the inaugural act of the last European social revolution of the twentieth century. A democratic political revolution soon turned into a social revolution with the expressive presence of the working class and popular and student sectors. The dictatorial regime collapsed with the end of the political control exerted by the Armed Forces. This article analyses the self-management processes that occurred during the revolutionary period in Portugal, relating them to the global economic crisis of 1973-1975.

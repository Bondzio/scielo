Abstract: This text tries to introduce the recent phenomenon of Romani Feminism that, from the beginning of the XXIst century, is spreading in many European countries and in America aiming at empowering Romani women in their communities and in the majority society. Using an intersectional perspective articulating gender, race and class, gypsy feminists, activists and academics, discuss with the most important post-colonial feminist currents, and in particular, with American Black Feminism and Chicano Feminism. In this view, Romani Feminism invites us to redefine post-colonial borders, thus emphasizing new spaces of subalternity and of struggles, and crossing geographic and symbolic lands which we usually think as central and hegemonic.

During the years, since its implementation, Pronaf has become more structured and has significantly increased its action field. Alongside the increase of resources, contracts, and number of benefited agriculturists, an important innovation of this program was the inclusion of new lines of funding, either through inserting segments until then, excluded from the agricultural policies, or including, recognizing, and legitimizing different activities performed in rural areas, such as familiar agroindrustialization. This paper aims to analyze the family agroindustry oriented rural credit policy (Pronaf-agroindustry), evidencing the constitution, elaboration, implementation and results of this line of funding. Moreover, the paper discusses the process of reformulation in the access conditions to the credit during recent years, analyzing the new portfolio constituted by a program called Mais Alimentos. The results of this paper highlight the flexibility of Pronaf-Agroindustry's financial conditions (reduction of interest rate, increase of the financed ceiling, and spread of the target public), which changes significantly the policy focus (it no longer benefits small family agroindustries exclusively, but also includes major milk cooperatives).

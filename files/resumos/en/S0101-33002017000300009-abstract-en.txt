ABSTRACT From 2004 to 2016, under Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff&#8217;s presidencies, a cycle of new industrial policies has been developed. State activism resulted in unprecedented support for r&amp;d and business innovation, even though marked by contradictions that undermined its effectiveness. The loss of focus on innovation has highlighted the need for a new generation of public policies to raise the standards of economic competitiveness.

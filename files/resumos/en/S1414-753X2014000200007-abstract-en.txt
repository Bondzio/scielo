A harmonic relationship between cultural heritage preservation and socioeconomic development is a present challenge in the management of historic sites. The article discusses the relationship between classification and urbanistic instruments, such as the master plan and the special zones. The analysis focuses on two recent initiatives: the Cultural Preservation Special Zone (ZEPEC) of São Paulo (2004) and the Special Zone of Interest to the Paranapiacaba Heritage (ZEIPP) of Santo André (2007). While the ZEPECs, which are based on a monument conception and a fragmented vision of urban heritage, reveal contradictions between preservation and development policies; the ZEIPP articulates territorial planning with sectoral policies of preservation, environmental conservation and socioeconomic and urban development within a perspective of integrated and participatory management. The cultural landscape is considered not only an asset to be preserved for upcoming generations, but also a resource for the sustainable development of their communities.

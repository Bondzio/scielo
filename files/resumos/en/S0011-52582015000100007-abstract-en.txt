This article presents a first estimate of the concentration of income among the richest in Brazil calculated based on income tax return statements between 2006 and 2012. The main inequality measurements are the fractions of the total income appropriated by the 0.1%, 1% and 5% richest. The results are tested and compared with that of household surveys. The article concludes that income data reveals concentration at the top that is substantially greater than other sources and, in general terms, remained stable in the period analyzed.

Abstract Although the Brazilian fashion's main market is domestic, in recent years a range of public and private agents have established initiatives aimed at its global consecration. To a large extent, this is carried out through the idea of "Brazilianness" used as a symbolic value in the global fashion market, where the country's fashion agents seek to legitimize it as global. Through information derived from extensive field research in Brazil and Europe, the article tries to understand the unequal legitimacy loans between the Brazilian agents and the fashion agencies historically consecrated. It also analyzes the motivations and reasons of the country's fashion intention to be global, considering the uneven dynamics of global economic and symbolic exchanges and the ethos of the agents involved in the Brazilian fashion's global enterprise.

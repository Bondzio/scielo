Agriculture shows itself as an important sector for contributing to the economic growth, as in developed countries as in developing countries. So, the objective of this article was to analyze the growth of the agriculture of Ceará based on the observation and comparison of the partial and total farming productivities, in the 1975-1995 period, considering the seven Meso-Regions of the State. For that purpose it was employed the index of Törnqvist-Theil, which measures the achieved farming productivities. The used data were secondary of the type cross-section, in agreement with the Agricultural Censures of Ceará, for the years of 1975, 1980, 1985 and 1995, published by IBGE. The conclusion is that the small changes in the farming productivity of Ceará practically have no affected on the structural changes occurred, what indicates that the public policies implemented in the period werent sufficient, as indicates the small farming productivity gain reached. Considered this, it is expected the implementation of public policies also in the areas whose edafoclimatic conditions are less favorable, what difficults the life of the rural worker and often leads to rural-urban migration.

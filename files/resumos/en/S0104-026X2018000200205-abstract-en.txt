Abstract: This article aims to analyze the participation of women in paulista&#8217;s medical field between 1898 and 1930. To achieve this purpose, we have analyzed two medical journals of large circulation in this period: the SÃ£o Paulo&#8217;s Medical Journal and Paulista&#8217;s Annals of Medicine and Surgery. Starting from the documental analyze, we achieve to think the complexes relations established among gendered, political and scientific discourses in paulistas&#8217;s medical press. We also sought to discuss the professional insertion of women in some fields that initially would be more permeable to them, such as charity, gynecology, obstetrics and pediatrics. Besides that, we will discuss the strategical mobilization of seeming neutrality that rounds the laboratorial activities, as a resource that women physicians used to insert themselves in some fields, deceiving the taboo involving male bodies.

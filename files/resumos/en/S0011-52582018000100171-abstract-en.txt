ABSTRACT The aim of this article is to analyze the historical trajectory of the Associação Cultural do Negro [Black Cultural Association] founded in São Paulo in 1954. To do so, we discuss its methods of organization, struggle, and dialogue within the national and international arena, with a particular focus on its role in the Afro-Atlantic network, a dynamic mesh of political-cultural connections in which Africans and their descendants on either side of the Atlantic established contacts and interconnections, exchanged information and experiences, and discussed ideas and projects on emancipation, influencing one another.

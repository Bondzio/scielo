Abstract This paper aims to examine how the interactions between the Kaiowa indigenous people and non indigenous people in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, generate identity-building processes. In this exercise, the patron (non-indigenous) - client (indigenous) relationship is a fact that will be analysed, using a consolidated literature about patronage and compadrio, considering its explanatory scope and limits. It is understood that the comprehension of interethnic relations in this region (as well as conflicts arising from them) will benefit precisely from this reflection, which has so far been little explored. It will be perceived that ethnic distinctions - built over time - are being reinforced and exacerbated by political processes, so that we find ourselves with reflections that have already been advanced by Max Weber.

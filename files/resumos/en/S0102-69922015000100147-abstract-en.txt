At the moment in which there is a public debate about pros and cons the expansion of rights for domestic workers in the Brazil, this article brings to the center of discussions the role of political organizations of domestic workers. Based on interviews with domestic workers, the article seeks to understand the reasons of social inequality that has historically characterized this professional occupation. Therefore, it is argued that the coloniality of power and the intersectionality among gender, class and race are structural and dynamic factors that can explain this phenomenon. On the other hand, it is also argued that domestic workers, throughout history, have articulated a social movement in dialogue with black movements, unions and feminists and other social actors that allows them to present a decolonial project. We call this dialogue and cooperation with trade union movements, black movements and feminist movements of intersectionality emancipatory. The article concludes by noting that in every legal advance of this professional category the organized political movement of domestic workers has been present.

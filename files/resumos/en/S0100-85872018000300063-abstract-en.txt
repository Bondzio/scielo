Abstract: The purpose of this article is to think about the mise-en-scène of religious experiences of Congadas, or Reinados, on film documentary, especially in the movie The coronation of a queen (1993), directed by Arthur Omar. Based on the concepts of confabulation and sacredness, the article brings a reading of Omar's work with attention to the ways how camera, montage and soundtrack become affected and, therefore, are constituted by the rites, myths and cosmology of the Reinado of Our Lady of the Rosary of Jatobá. To do so, we identify both the objects, sounds, gestures of Congadas that acquire a fictional power, as well as the filmic resources that reverberate such power.

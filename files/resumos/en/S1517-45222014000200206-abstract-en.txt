The development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has intensified the debate over the democratic possibilities offered by the Internet. Its network structure, coupled with interaction tools, has enabled new forms of social organizations and a creative agenda for political action, which can mean a step forward in the development of democratic processes. These technologies allow the development of new means of communication between the State and the Civil Society. This paper aims to evaluate the dynamics of Rede Nossa São Paulo (RNSP), a civic movement formed by almost 700 institutions, which operates in the metropolitan area of São Paulo, and to analyze its coordination strategies through the Internet to promote political action. The evaluation of RNSP's e-participation was performed through three approaches: (1) identification of the different forms of e-participation; (2) evaluation of the key dimensions of e-participation; and (3) measuring of RNSP's actions in accordance to the level of digital democracy. The findings allow us to observe that the internet can help in the promotion of democratic actions, creating new ways of political action in Civil Society.

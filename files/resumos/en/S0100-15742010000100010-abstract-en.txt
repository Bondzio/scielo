The adoption of new student selection processes for university entrance was only made possible by enactment of Education Law no 9,394/96. The university entrance exam by periodic assessment is one of these alternative proposals that provides for a systematic evaluation of the students at the end of each high school year. The purpose of this study was to describe the university entrance exam by periodic assessment, used today used in 22 public institutions, concerning: its objective, assessment styles and the content of the Biology discipline, which is divided into modules that refer to the three grades of high school. We noted that there is no uniformity in the different programs analyzed in several of their aspects, such as the number of places, assessment structure and program content. We also observed a lack of consensus regarding the sequence to be adopted for the teaching of Biology and the resulting restriction for the student being able to be prepared for the periodic tests in more than one institution.

This study aims to assess the effects of different objectives contained in the notifications applied to the TBT and SPS Agreements of the World Trade Organization had on international trade in different agrifood products between 1996 and 2010. For this purpose, we used a gravity model, estimated by the method of sample selection. The results showed that notifications for the purposes of consumer information contributed to the increase of the trade. Similarly, when the justifications of goals of notifications were combating epidemics worldwide, such as Avian Influenza, Bovine Brucellosis and other diseases, the international trade was favored. For other objectives, such as food safety, animal health, plant protection and conformity assessment, the effects were not standardized. We concluded that, if the countries disclose the meeting of the requirements of the TBT and SPS notifications, trade will be expanded. Thus, trade policies and business strategies can use labels and medias to disclose how the requirements contained in the notifications were met. Therefore, the gains from trades can be expanded.

This text is an excerpt from a comparative study of inclusive policies and practices in João Pessoa (Brazil) and Lisbon (Portugal) and seeks broader subsidies for a reflection on the topic. The study was conducted in inclusive schools of early education through interviews with the responsible parties so as to become acquainted with the professional conditions and their difficulties. According to the data, in João Pessoa inclusive schools lack special education teachers, while these professionals work in regular schools in Lisbon. In both realities, a need for specialists was observed as a criterion for inclusion. The data may reveal an intention to define territories for ancient clinical practices or a need to review old concepts of the educational system that might contribute to education for all.

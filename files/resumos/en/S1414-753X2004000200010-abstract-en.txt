The mathematical models of pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere represent an important technical instrument, as for the knowledge of the state of the atmosphere, united to the monitoring net, as for the environmental administration. In this work the operational and theoretical characteristics of air pollution models are evidenced. Models of new generation that can represent the atmospheric turbulence directly through the value of the Monin-Obukhov length and of the friction velocity are introduced. Besides, it is pointed out that a correct use of the transport and diffusion models in the atmosphere depends of a study about their capacities of representing real situations confronting the calculated values of the models with experimental observations. It is deepened in matter, seen the great present time of the phenomenon, the use of the mathematical models of dispersion in the management of the air quality in urban environment.

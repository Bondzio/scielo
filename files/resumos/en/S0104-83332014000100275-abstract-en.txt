In this paper I will reflect on transmigratory processes involved in the construction of gender identities in travestis. I will focus on the migratory experiences of Brazilian travestieswho have traveled to and who are still re-locating in Europe, seeking insertion into the local sex market. I employ the concept "trans migration" to refer to the specificity of their migratory projects: they not only migrate seeking greater social, symbolic and economic well-being, but also their geographical mobility affects how they transform and beautify their bodies. Identities in travestiesare created in this continuous process of transiting. At the same time, an analysis will be made of the reconfiguration of their identities in the European context, because their "Brazilian-ness" is highlighted intentionally as a strategy to excel andto stand out from the rest in a sex market increasingly limited by public policies and economic recession.

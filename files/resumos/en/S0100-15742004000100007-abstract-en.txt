The objective of this article is to examine teacher training approaches in both elementary schools in the States of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, identifying the relevant aspects related to its implementation. We examined the available documents on the programs, technical proposals, and external assessment reports. Training carried out between 1996 and 1998 was supported by the World Bank and included different teaching methods: face-to-face education in São Paulo and mixed education (face-to-face and distance education) in Minas Gerais. Comparing the two programs it was finally concluded that in order for training to be successful it is important to observe a set of factors and leave space for different training designs.

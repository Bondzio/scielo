The study analyzes the convergence of the labor productivity in the Brazilian agricultural sector in the nineties, comparing it with its productivity in the other sectors and projecting its future behavior through Markov matrices. The results indicate that the Brazilian states are diverging in the labor productivity in the agricultural sector. Some states will move to a high level and others to a low level of labor productivity. In five of the other sectors of the Brazilian economy there will be a convergence of the states with regard to the labor productivity. In three of these five sectors the states will converge to a low level of labor productivity; in one sector they will converge to two classes of low productivity and in another sector the states will move to a class of high productivity. The time required for convergence of the Brazilian states is very long; indicating that the economic factors prevailing during the period on which the analysis is based did not impact very strongly on this process.

The aim of this text is to broaden the perspective of the analysis of a tension area that has emerged in the school environment, by means of two movements: a. the resignification, rereading or reinterpretation processes of the set of rules and regulations by teachers, principals, and coordinators of public schools; b. the way they apply such processes to their teaching and management practices, considering the contexts in which they have been educated and practised their profession. It was assumed that in such setting working relationships are established on one tripod: a. the set of laws and regulations (predictable and relatively stable, given that their modification requires political negotiation processes and/or changes in the executive sphere); b. the informal regulations which are set and negotiated among counterparts on a daily basis in face of real work situations (unpredictable); c. the social and economic factors that determine an increasingly unpredictable area of unique practices given the deepening of the social, economic and value crisis which pervade contemporary capitalism.

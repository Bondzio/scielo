In Brazil the conception of inclusive education is strongly shaped by the notion of special education and the categorization of pupils' behaviour. A document called Special education national policy in the perspective of inclusive education was submitted to the Education Minister on January 7th 2008. It stresses the notions of global or functional disorders, deficiency and deficit which go with that kind of categorization. A tendency towards a "psychopathology of inclusion" is becoming apparent in this document. Using two expressions "policy is education" and "education is policy" we analyse the contradictions of education policies and their institutionnalizations from the theoretical frame of lacanian oriented psychoanalysis.

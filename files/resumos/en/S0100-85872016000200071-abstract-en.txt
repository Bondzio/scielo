Abstract The article aims to articulate the issue of ways to testify, within Catholicism, with the modalities of veridiction &#8211; styles of truth-telling studied by Foucault &#8211; through the notion of parrhesia, a Greek concept crucially related to connotations for public life, which nowdays it has been taken over by the Charismatic Renewal as a gift of the Holy Spirit. The description of parrhesia through ethnographic data will allow the perception of internal differentiation occurring in the Catholic Church. The &#8220;boldness in the Holy Spirit&#8221;, as parrhesia is often called, is establishing relations of opposition and complementary with the exemplar life, replacing it with apostrophic attitudes including pneumatic transmission, which entails different models of action on the world with political overtones.

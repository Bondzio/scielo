Abstract The article discusses the context of the formation of the main art collection of the current Art Museum of Bahia, Jonathas Abbott Collection, examining the autobiographical narrative of Abbott's travel diary, which was written during his travel to Europe between 1830 and 1832. By investigating the construction of the individuality of the collector Jonathas Abbott during his time in Brazil (1816-1887) it aims to understand the aesthetic basis of Abbott's collection and the nature of his taste. It is argued that Abbott's individuality, the formation of his taste, and the aesthetic nature of his collection constituted defining elements of the spirit of Abbott Gallery as a whole.

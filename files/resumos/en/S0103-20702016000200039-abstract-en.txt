Abstract Looking for a sociological approach to the anchoring of delinquency, urban violence and Islamist radicalization in a fraction of young people from disadvantaged areas, we first studied the reproduction crisis of the popular classes associated with the changes in the labor market, the school system, the residential space and the framing of these young people from disadvantaged areas. Then, narrowing the focus of observation, we consider the sociogenesis of street culture (the legacy of the poor with school failure, the investment in street culture and the unemployment), to focalize the world of gangs and the environment of professional delinquency, disorder practices, and the revival of religious practices.

The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the relationship between the public and private domains in the context of the operationalization of social assistance policies, focusing on the family and the role of women. For a long time there has been criticism on the instrumental role of families and women in such policies, in the organization of policies for social protection, with a focus on programs dealing with the transfer of income within social assistance. Based on research carried out in this area, the reflection has been organized in two topics: the family as the locus of social policies with an emphasis on policies aiming at the reduction of poverty in the context of social assistance; women and the mediation between families and social assistance policies in the context of the Unified System for Social Assistance.

Abstract: This article discusses the process of social interaction established between the pharmacist and clerks and the consumers of emergency contraception (EC). It is an ethnographic research held at a drugstore in the north area of the municipal district of Rio de Janeiro, from January, 2011, to December, 2012. Two dimensions are analyzed: - the silence and shame governing the marketing of EC at the drugstore; - The discriminatory view of clerks on the EC women consumers. Silence and shame perceived in the drugstore counter, socio-spatial and moral conceptions of the EC consumers reinforce the need for broadening the national debate on guaranteed access to EC, aimed at ensuring sexual and reproductive rights of women.

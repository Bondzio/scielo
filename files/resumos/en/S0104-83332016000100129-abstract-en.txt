Abstract The present article discusses the ways in which care work are taking on specific configurations in Brazil and Italy, based on ethnographic studies with care providers and their employers in SÃ£o Paulo and Bologna. Our objective is to show that the increasing visibility of this pair of undesired people &#8211; the elderly and their caregivers &#8211; is redefining forms of dependence and giving new meanings to family relationships, state obligations and domestic life.

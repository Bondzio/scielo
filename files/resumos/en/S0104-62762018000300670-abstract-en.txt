Abstract The central aim of this research is to demonstrate that the local (sociodemographic and institutional) context helps explain changes in voters&#8217; vote choice in support of different political parties. This research analyzes the electoral volatility index for local legislators in four municipal elections&#8212;2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016&#8212;with a sample of all Brazilian cities. This work contributes to the literature about both electoral behavior and party systems. The results show that the contextual variables have a more intense effect in small municipalities and at the beginning of the analyzed period.

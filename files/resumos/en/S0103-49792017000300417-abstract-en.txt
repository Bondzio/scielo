In analyzing the evolution of contemporary capitalism (automation, informatization, globalization), Andr√© Gorz emphasizes the social consequences (unemployment, precarization, inequalities, poverty). Focusing on the transformations of labor (valorization of skills and imagination) that accompany these changes, he deciphers the rise of a general intellect, that capitalism tries to appropriate, but that confuses itself with the &#8220;production of the self&#8221;, that is, with activities which personal faculties can develop outside subordinated labor. A new, qualitative type of wealth, based on cooperative social links, is created. A basic income is thought of as a transitory existential anchor that makes this flight possible.

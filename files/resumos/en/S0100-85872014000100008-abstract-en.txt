Taking into account the composition of Pentecostalism a mixture of, on one side, a Protestant tradition that allows the constitution of the 'sincere person', and, on the other side, the enchanted aspects of personhood what happens when this message is disseminated in a context with a long Catholic tradition by 'translators' socialized in the Catholic culture; in other words, by people with a particular interpretation of the Protestant tradition? In this article, the author explores this question and shows how the Catholic framing impacts the arrangements for accommodating the semiotic ideologies of 'sincerity' and 'saintliness' within Pentecostal religiosity, resulting in singular manifestations of the collective project and of the regional Christian Person.

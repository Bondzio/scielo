Abstract The present article, starting from the evidence of the &#8220;spiritualist literary phenomenon&#8221; in Brazil, intends to analise some of its textual strategies of cultural construction of reality and authorship. To reach this aim, the postmodernist anthropology is discussed here, pointing out that its importance is not bordered to the examination of anthropological texts, but also can be used to understand the religious literature.

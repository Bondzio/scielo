Abstract: The woman participation in different areas of society has been increasing, but she still faces obstacles, including her integration in the world of science. Seeking a better understanding of this phenomenon, it was carried out a survey that mapped the female participation in research development in Brazil, from the analysis of the Lattes curricula of 4,970 women who presented their doctoral dissertations between 2000 and 2013. In regarding to technical procedures, it was used the documentary research, which data collection took place from December 2013 to July 2014. The results show that women have made many advances in this area, but that inequality of roles between women and men persists within the science.

The purpose of this paper is to introduce    and discuss the method and its methodology as well. The paper will elaborate    on how the method is applied to international research and will provide concrete    examples drawn from a bigger research project on economic elites in eleven countries.    It will demonstrate the steps of interpretation of interview material from this    project with the help of CMA, using concrete text sequences. The sequences have    been extracted from interviews with Brazilian top managers that were conducted    in the context of an international research project. The paper will show, how    an institutional approach, that is relying on the sociology of knowledge, can    be supported by a method, that helps to reconstruct the cognitive and normative    rules in a given culture and to analyze, how these rules are translated in action    orientations to solve culturally significant problems. Thus, the method can    be a remedy for the shortcomings of institutional analysis in mapping and comparing    the knowledge stocks in different cultures and a new tool in international comparative    research.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords</b>:    qualitative methods; interpretation pattern; qualitative social research; analysis    of collective mindsets; institutional analysis.</font></p> <hr noshade size="1">     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O artigo tem como    objetivo apresentar um m&eacute;todo espec&iacute;fico de analise qualitativa    - <i>Collective Mindset Analysis</i> (CMA) - aplicado na an&aacute;lise e mapeamento    de institui&ccedil;&otilde;es cognitivas e normativas, dentro de uma abordagem    institucional. Tanto o m&eacute;todo quanto sua metodologia ser&atilde;o introduzidos    e discutidos ao longo deste trabalho. Apresenta-se como o CMA pode ser aplicado    em pesquisa internacional comparada, apoiando-se em casos concretos (entrevistas    com executivos brasileiros) e tendo como pano de fundo uma pesquisa sobre elites    econ&ocirc;micas realizada em 11 pa&iacute;ses. A an&aacute;lise demonstra como    a abordagem institucional, apoiada na perspectiva te&oacute;rica da sociologia    do conhecimento, pode ser sustentada por um m&eacute;todo, o qual contribui    para a reconstru&ccedil;&atilde;o das regras cognitivas e normativas de interpreta&ccedil;&atilde;o    e a&ccedil;&atilde;o em uma determinada cultura, assim como para a an&aacute;lise    de como essas regras se traduzem na orienta&ccedil;&atilde;o da a&ccedil;&atilde;o    desses atores, empregada na solu&ccedil;&atilde;o de problemas culturamente    significativos.

Introduction<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a></b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In analyzing societies,    cultures or economies, collective mindsets play an important role. They tell    us about the spiritual construction and the knowledge stocks of a given society,    culture or economy, how this knowledge stock is translated into action orientations,    how these orientations change over time and how different they are in various    cultures. To identify, map and compare the knowledge stocks in different cultures    helps us to know more about how institutions and ideas travel, how globalization    takes shape and how transcultural the cultural repertoires in fact are. More    specific questions can also be answered <i>e.g.</i> about the collective mindsets    of capitalist production in use, about social justice and politics and the change    in political cultures as well.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In sociology, the    analysis of collective mindsets is part of an institutional analysis of societies,    dealing especially with cognitive and normative institutions. For Scott, cognitive    elements constitute the social meaning of reality and the frames through which    reality is perceived. Cognitive institutions provide a taken-for-granted perspective,    natural habits and acknowledged rules about how to understand the world (see    Scott 1995, p. 40). Normative institutions introduce collectively acknowledged    rules about what is perceived as right and wrong and the obligations guiding    action (<i>idem</i>, p. 37). Thus, collective mindsets are important elements    of cognitive and normative institutions, providing the cultural repertoire of    how to perceive problems and how to solve them. Any institutional analysis therefore    relies at least on assumptions about the underlying knowledge stocks in a given    culture at work and the collectively acknowledged rules. However, rarely, are    these knowledge stocks and underlying cognitive and normative rules systematically    analyzed or mapped. More often, they are derived from a general understanding    of the culture, form theory or formal institutions at work without any sound    empirical proof. Against this backdrop, the article introduces the "Deutungsmusteranalyse"<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>,    <i>i.e.</i> the "Collective Mindset Analysis" (CMA) as a qualitative tool to    remedy the empirical shortcomings of the more general institutional analyses    of societies, cultures or economies. This is its main objective.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CMA is related    to the reconstruction of social meaning and collectively acknowledged rules    that cannot be stated from an "objective" observation post, but has to be reconstructed    from the viewpoint of a member of the respective culture. In the frame of interpretive    sociology, it has a particular status, not just because it entails a reconstruction    of the subjective individual meaning, but because of the intersubjectively shared    social meaning. The CMA is neither interested in individual attitudes and action    orientations and how they are related to the social status in a society nor    in the "objective" meaning of the formal structure of institutions. Its purpose    is to reconstruct the collectively acknowledged cultural sense-making, the knowledge    inventory and the normative rules behind the individual attitudes and opinions    (see Ullrich 1999, p. 430; Stachura 2005, p. 167). The CMA is not just focused    on explicit statements, arguments and ideas, but also on the "tacit knowledge"    (Polanyi 1966), that is collectively shared, the hidden knowledge "frames" (Goffman    1974) that are at work in a culture. Thus, the focus of the CMA is on the collectively    accepted, explicit and tacit knowledge frames that constitute social meaning    in a given culture and instruct individual meaning, attitudes and action.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To introduce the    CMA as a tool that can contribute to the analysis of cognitive and normative    institutions, we start off with a chapter in which the sociological tradition    and theory behind the CMA is depicted. In this section we also portray the German    debate on the use of the method and the two basic versions that are applied    (2). In the subsequent chapter, the application of the CMA is made more concrete,    as we outline sampling methods, the type of survey and methods of analysis linked    with the CMA (3). Using a case study that examines the neoliberal financial    market mindsets of Brazilian Top Managers, and how these are represented in    interview statements, we apply the CMA method by explicating and illustrating    each step in the analysis (4). The concluding remarks discuss the advantages    and disadvantages of the method and sums up how it contributes to institutional    analysis (5).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>II. The sociological    approach and two versions of collective mindset analysis</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CMA is a qualitative    method originating in Germany. It is supposed to contribute to institutional    analysis of societies and is rooted in the sociology of knowledge. It was originally    invented by Oevermann (2001a; 2001b) in Germany, and further developed by Ullrich    (1999), Schetsche (2000), Sachweh (2010) and others. Although the debate has    mostly taken place within German sociology (Allert 1976; Arnold 1983; Dewe 1984;    L&uuml;ders 1991; Meuser &amp; Sackmann 1992; L&uuml;ders &amp; Meuser 1997;    Oevermann 2001a; 2001b; Pla&szlig; &amp; Schetsche 2001; Sachweh 2010, etc.),    it is very close to international debates on social cognition (Zerubavel 1997;    Kunda 1999), cultural repertoires (see Holley 2011), sensemaking (Weick 1993;    1995) and discourse analysis (see Keller 2011).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The method is based    on the frame of institutional action theory, which asks what are the culturally    inherited rules that people use, when faced with the challenge of how to act.    In the tradition of institutional theory, it is neither based on Rational Choice    and on methodological individualism nor on system theory and methodological    holism. Relying on the Sociology of Knowledge of Alfred Sch&uuml;tz (1971),    and Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann (1969), it lies in-between. Its purpose    is to reconstruct and map the knowledge stocks in use, the rules of interpretation    and action in a respective culture during a specific period of time.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The idea of "collective    mindsets" has its roots also in the classics of sociological literature, that    focused on the importance of "societal or cultural knowledge" or "social facts"    (Durkheim). Durkheim put it as "Collective Representations" (1898; 1967), that    are collective cognitive structures in a given society, which are supposed to    change according to the collective rules of this society. In another frame of    sociological theory, Pareto was addressed "derivations", that provide seemingly    reasonable frames of explanations to conceal the "irrational causes" behind    (Pareto 1962). Max Weber stressed the role of ideas in history, pointing out,    how they can push societal change in the frame of institutions and interests    (Weber 1904). Last, but not least Karl Mannheim developed, in his sociology    of knowledge, the perspective that every form of knowledge is dependent on social    position in a society and the social strata that we are part of (Mannheim 1980).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This broader frame    of references to the classical sociological literature, Sch&uuml;tz (1971) and    Berger and Luckmann (1969) provides the central ideas behind the method. For    Sch&uuml;tz, who took the natural lifeworld as a basic category for identifying    the knowledge stock behind the action orientations, the "lifeworld" was the    taken-for-granted, "common-sense reality" of the social world (see Sch&uuml;tz    1971). Thus, according to Berger and Luckmann (1969), habitualized actions,    which "retain their meaningful character for the individual although the meanings    involved become embedded as routines in his general stock of knowledge, taken    for granted by him and at hand for his projects into the future. Habitualization    carries with it the important psychological gain that choices are narrowed.    While in theory there may be a hundred ways to go about the project of building    a canoe out of matchsticks, habitualization narrows these down to one. This    frees the individual from the burden of 'all those decisions', providing a psychological    relief that has its basis in man's undirected instinctual structure" (Berger    &amp; Luckmann 1966, p. 59). By habitualization, the knowledge stock of a given    society is generated and reproduced, providing routines and rules of interpretation    (patterns, schemes) and action (scripts). Thus, this lifeworld is also "Wirkwelt",    a world that shall be influenced by our actions (Sch&uuml;tz 1979). It is constituted    by collectively acknowledged ideas, practices, and scripts that can be enacted    by actors, when dealing with the necessity to act. By this enactment, the cultural    inherited ideas, practices, and scripts are reproduced or changed, once a significant    number of actors within a particular culture, transforms the knowledge stocks    in use.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a sociological    approach, the objective of the CMA is to identify, reconstruct and map these    knowledge stocks and their changes. The sociological CMA addresses "objective    problems" in a given society, culture or economy and the cultural repertoires    available to cope with these "objective problems" (see Oevermann 2001a; 2001b).    The CMA can also be applied in political science to analyze the line of argument    in a political discourses (Francis 1965; Lepsius 1967; 1986; 1990; Stachura    2005), in media studies to the content analysis of media discourses <i>e.g.</i>    on sexual abuse or satanic rituals (Schetsche 1992; 1997; Schmied-Knittel 2008)    or in criminology to criminologist research on witness statements (H&ouml;ffling,    Pla&szlig; &amp; Schetsche 2002).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In sociology, the    "Deutungsmusteranalyse", <i>i.e.</i> CMA, first elaborated by Oeverman in 1973    (Overman 2001a), was revised by Oevermann in 2001 (Overmann 2001b) and reconstructed    as a new, "light version" by Ullrich in 1999. Thus, there are today two applications    of the CMA in sociology, and others in discourse analysis like Pla&szlig; and    Schetsche (2001) and Keller (2011). For the purpose of this article, we concentrate    on the two sociological variants, and demonstrate the application of the "light    version" of Ullrich (1999) with some modifications introduced by us for international    comparative research.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>i</i>) The    concept of collective patterns of interpretation, as introduced into sociology    by Oevermann (2001a), originates in the earlier works of Francis (1965) and    Lepsius (1967). Back then, the term was used in the sense of "conceptual order"    (Oevermann 2001a; 2001b). An unpublished text of Oevermann was enough to revive    a discussion on the concept. This text was written as part of a research project    on the topic of "parental home and school" in 1973. According to Oevermann (2001b,    p. 36), what was lacking at the time was a new way out of the traps of both    materialist historiography - which only results in ideological disputes - as    well as quantitative survey research - which fails to grasp emergent effects    that go beyond the scope of attitudes and opinions. Among other things, the    methodological aim was to break through the standardization within the quantitative    paradigm - especially with regard to the arbitrary configuration of items -    to enable the sociologist to account for the actual and complex motivations    at work, in the background of a specific response. These complex motivations    were considered as the structure of a collective unconscious (<i>ibidem</i>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Right from the    start, Oevermann (<i>idem</i>, p. 38) made the main idea of this "conceptual    turn" very clear. For all the basic existential problems of a society that come    up time and time again, potential solutions are to be found in the collective    patterns of interpretation, to which all sufficiently socialized actors can    turn in times of crisis and uncertainty. These patterns of interpretation are    routines; they operate and evolve like implicit theories - without it being    necessary to consider their validity during the application. Due to their problem-solving    capability, they stand the test of time and consequently take on a life of their    own.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This aspect is    well illustrated by the following example: Starting from a very common action    problem - <i>e.g.</i> the question of: How do I raise my child properly? - the    socialized actor cannot start all over again and "reinvent the wheel". The need    for routines is extremely high for parents who try to do a good job, and so    is the likelihood that their search for orientation will lead them to adopt    traditional solutions - <i>i.e.</i> they draw on collective mindsets as cultural    repertoire. The traditional way is not necessarily the easiest path that the    parents thus choose, but it is a relief not having to think every step through    in all of its consequences, especially when there is not much time to think.    In contrast to the manifold objective action problems, we may therefore expect    - like Oevermann (<i>idem</i>) - to find collectively established patterns of    routine interpretation that are rooted in the respective environments and realms    of experience. These routines allow for diverse action problems to be dealt    with on a daily basis. For Oevermann (<i>ibidem</i>), interpretation patterns    are predominantly cognitive representations - in the sense of Popper representations    of world 3 (<i>i.e.</i> the world of objective thought contents, in addition    to the outside world and the world of consciousness). These cognitive representations    embody knowledge (<i>idem</i>, p. 51) but they are not explicit knowledge. It    is therefore not possible to survey patterns of interpretation with a quantitative    questionnaire. However, like any form of knowledge, the cognitive representations    embody the experience of dealing with problems and crises that are passed on,    by drawing on collective stocks of knowledge (<i>ibidem</i>). Oevermann prefers    to speak of tacit knowledge, when the cognitive representations are neither    consciously retrievable nor reflected, but nonetheless put `structuring' into    practice (<i>idem</i>, p. 56). Patterns of interpretation fall in this category    of tacit knowledge, according to Oevermann. However, we must distinguish patterns    of interpretation from the category of "latent meaning structures" within the    framework of objective hermeneutics. Latency refers to the methodological approach    of the researcher, who has to render them accessible and manifest during the    research process without being able to observe them directly (Oevermann <i>et    al.</i>, 1979; Oevermann 1981). To be precise, the patterns of interpretation    are the implicit representations of latent knowledge stocks.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Oevermann,    the patterns of interpretation is influential for everyday cognition. The patterns    themselves remain "tacit knowledge"; structures that require a logical architecture    of arguments, built to sustain the respective practice or course of action (Oevermann    2001b, p. 36). They require a certain consistency and instructiveness for troubleshooting,    which is why they are anchored in cultures, environments and lifestyles, and    vary according to these. They form a cognitive element of the collective knowledge    stocks and thus survive or change only collectively. As tacit knowledge, they    generate individually different problem solutions, opinions and attitudes. In    order for them to change, they usually have to fail at solving the objective    action problem - this failure is more than an individual exception from the    rule and of collective relevance. Against this methodological background, the    interest in collective mindsets draws on the insight that individual attitudes    and action orientations depend on the collective "supply" with collectively    acknowledged interpretations. After all, the general research question is raised,    which rules of interpretation and action apply with regard to a specific collective    knowledge in a given society. The sociologist may uncover these rules through    the method that is thus termed "collective mindset analysis".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>ii</i>) Like    for Oevermann, the CMA of Ullrich is concentrated on the reconstruction of "social    meaning", and not of subjective reasoning. The focus is on the constitution    of action orientations, on the conditions concerning the collective knowledge    stocks (see Ullrich 1999, p. 430). In the frame of action theory, those action    orientations are assumed to be constituted through a combination and crossover    of cognitive, normative, evaluative and expressive dimensions (<i>ibidem</i>).    These dimensions of the collective mindset need to be analyzed and demonstrated,    how they are transformed in the framing of a situation and ultimately, translated    into action orientations. Unlike Oevermann, Ullrich emphasizes the manifest    or even stereotypical character of collective mindsets. It is assumed that the    collective mindset can also be a reflected explicit form of reasoning and justification,    like a scientific knowledge background that organizes the line of argument.    Referring to Pareto, Ullrich called the individual adoption of collective mindsets,    "derivations" (<i>ibidem</i>). Actors use these derivations to explain and justify    their actions in a way that can be understood by others. Thus, actors refer    to legitimate forms of knowledge, <i>i.e.</i> collective mindsets, that are    shared in a given society, culture, or economy. However, only the derivations    can be gathered and surveyed directly, not the knowledge stock of collective    mindsets that lie behind (<i>ibidem</i>, p. 431). As a result, the CMA is an    analysis of individual derivations, that need to be to be classified and typified    using a method that helps to reconstruct the underlying cognitive, normative    and evaluative logic in the line of arguments and upon which individual derivations    are based.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On these grounds,    the reconstruction of cognitive and normative rules can be a sound contribution    to an institutional analysis focused on cognitive and normative institutions.    This is not done by referring to a theory that instructs us in a deductive method    about what lies behind those derivations. Rather, it is done by analyzing the    self-representations of actors in an inductive method, reconstructing the knowledge    stocks on the basis of the interview material available. For that starting point    of qualitative research, Ullrich recommends methods of sampling, interview methods    and methods of analyzing the interviews. Unlike Oevermann, his recommendations    do not lead to the reconstruction of single cases with a strong effort of hermeneutical    interpretation of the "objective meaning" of language, but instead focuses on    reconstructing socially shared meaning through a cross-comparison of sequences    of many interviewees related to a particular problem of action. These sequences    are analysed using categorization, classification and type casting methods.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The method of Ullrich    can thus be labelled a "light version" of Oevermann's CMA, because its methodological    prerequisites are not as complex and its hermeneutic efforts are not as exhausting    as in the case of Oevermann's CMA. Given that Oevermann's hermeneutic method    depends predominantly on language skills as well as idiosyncratic interpretations    of single case studies, it does not seem not suitable for international comparisons    with a greater number of interviews. The opposite is true for the CMA of Ullrich.    Therefore, the focus of our paper is on the application and modification of    Ullrich's CMA-approach to an international comparative research design.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>III. The CMA    - method and methodology</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due to the fact    that collective mindsets are forms of collective background knowledge in a given    society, they need to be reconstructed using qualitative analytical tools. In    this frame of interpretive sociology, we have to decide on the sampling methods    (<i>i</i>), the type of survey; (<i>ii</i>) and the methods of analysis (<i>iii</i>),    to be employed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>i</i>) Like    Ullrich (1999, p. 433), we assume that the CMA can certainly not be executed    as a single case-analysis, for then a generalization has to be left aside or    done in another way (for example using other empirical studies, sources or scientific    documents). As a general rule, the CMA needs more than one or two cases to prove,    how "institutionalized" a collectively established pattern of interpretation    is. This should not be misunderstood in terms of quantitative social research    methods for we still operate with qualitative representativeness. Following    in the footsteps of "grounded theory" (Glaser &amp; Strauss 1967; Strauss 1987;    Corbin &amp; Strauss 1990) if there are few cases in the sample, it is recommended    to work with "theoretical sampling", which implies operating a method of permanent    contrast that leads to a theoretical saturation point. Theoretical saturation    is achieved once further analysis will not increase the variance in interpretation    patterns or only by a little more. If only a few cases are available it is suggested    to start with the method of minimal and maximal contrast. Following an interpretation    generated by analyzing the first case, a very similar or a very dissimilar case    is selected as the next case of analysis. Comparison with the similar case raises    the question in what aspects differences can be found. Comparing with the dissimilar    case raises the question whether there are similarities. In doing so, the selection    of cases is always theoretically founded. Concretely, this means that one is    always reflecting upon which types of differentiation or dimensions might be    evident in the collective mindsets after the first case, the second case, the    third case and so on.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of    a greater sample of interviews - we have altogether 277 interviews in eleven    countries - a proportional quota sampling is an alternative, if data on the    parent population are available. This is a non-probability sample in which the    researcher selects people according to a theoretically chosen quota. The interviewees    are selected into a sample on the basis of chosen characteristics in order to    reach the same distribution of characteristics as in the parent population.    The characteristics can be gauged by an inductive procedure. Nevertheless, this    sampling method is already in between that of a qualitative and quantitative    approach. Relying on the data of our standardized life course analysis in our    case, the interview sample was selected using a proportional quota sampling    method related to age, sex, education, and international activities of the CEOs.    To use only theoretical sampling as well as to select a probability sample was    not possible in this field of research because you cannot randomly select interviewees    out of the target population of CEOs from the Top 100 industrial companies.    To reach a qualitative representativeness of the sample, proportional quota    sampling seemed therefore to be the best solution.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>ii</i>) Concerning    the type of survey, Ullrich (1999, p. 434) recommends carrying out a discursive    interview. This is a guided, semi-structured interview with questions, aimed    at evoking statements, arguments, and justifications. These questions can even    be confrontational and provocative, in order to generate arguments. However,    unlike Ullrich, we do not think that one is in need of just one specific method    for the interviews. As long as we do not use standardized surveys, one can apply    various kinds of interviewing methods that generate narrations, descriptions,    explanations, justifications and argumentations on the topics, we are interested    in. In principle, all texts and images generated by a given society, culture    or economy can be objects of analysis for CMA. There are no further limitations    regarding the material. However, there is a condition if the material embodies    a marginal text only. Therefore, standardized and partly standardized methods    of data acquisition normally generate poorly suited material for CMA. In contrast,    the density of material is huge if narrative or problem-based interviews are    carried out. In particular there are available narrative texts by being not    much penetrated by argumentation. This permits the identification of differentiations,    fissures and inconsistencies more easily. An open-minded, even artificial naivety    is a precondition for the approach and the question, which collective mindset    is to be analyzed, is a question that emerges from the empirical material itself.    In order to carry out rigorous comparison within an international project certainly    necessitates working together with native speakers. They have to execute the    analysis or at a minimum, must participate while analyzing for otherwise the    cultural contexts in the text risks being inadequately explored.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since narratives    are resistant to routines, regularities and standard-operating-procedures biographical    narration tends towards experiences and worth-telling occurrences that gain    prominence in life, thus generating meaning, balance and evaluation. Thus in    terms of phenomenology, "meaningful" occurrences and the experiences of narrators    are adequate to use for CMA. Some examples of elements that discharge in narration    as occurrences as well as experiences that lead to narration on self-experienced    episodes from life are: perceptible processes of transformation, projects that    have a beginning and a definite end, crises, fissures and turning points. Concurrently,    a problem-centered strategy of inquiry is appropriate for the subject. It allows    interviewees to develop an "insider-perspective". A strategy of inquiry that    is selective and problem-based, helps gain a view into the organizational self-awareness    of actors. This is based, on the one hand on a theoretical scientific pre-understanding    and, on the other hand, on an empirical comparative perspective. That is, the    themes activated in the problem-centered part of inquiry are systematically    adapted, revised, supplemented and extended in the course of the survey. It    is essential in any case to keep the aim of qualitative research in mind, which    is to discover the unknown. Generating theory takes place during the research    process, when procedures of action, meaning and perception are reconstructed.    In the case of problem-based interviews, conversations combine - in terms of    the research pragmatic - an open start plus a strategy of inquiry that generates    narration with an initiation of conversation that is structured thematically    by an interview guideline handled un-bureaucratically.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>iii</i>) In    the CMA-design, we now have access to the "derivations" - the material we need    to reconstruct the collective mindsets that lie behind. One must always keep    in mind that collective mindsets are not attitudes, opinions or ideologies<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a>    of individual actors. On the surface of speech and texts, we will find opinions    and attitudes. These are rather fast changing interpretation patterns, related    to a wide range of topics and rooted in the psychological make-up of an individual    personality. They can be changed individually. They are easily figured out in    empirical research. In contrast, collective mindsets are the collective forms    of our background knowledge. They change according to our culture, and as part    of the collective knowledge inventory, they cannot be changed individually.    They are not rooted in the psychology of actors, but in the history of social    groups, cultures or societies. They are not talk, but the grammar of knowledge    about how to solve social problems in a given society. They are not easily detected    at the surface of everyday talk, but have to be reconstructed in an elaborate    method of qualitative analysis.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, using the    material of the transcribed interviews as a starting point, we now need to find    out, what the background forms of collective knowledge are that lead to these    narrations and argumentations related to the topics that we are interested in.    By applying methods of qualitative content analysis, we exercise eight steps    of interpretation:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Selection:      We select sequences related to specific topics (according to our research      interests);</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Reformulation:      We summarize and reformulate the arguments, explanations, and narrations in      the sequences by rephrasing them;</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Abstraction:      We abstract the logical and normative structure, by eliminating what is not      necessary to understand the basic categories of the argument, description      or narration;</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Abstraction      of order: We abstract the logical and normative order in the flow of arguments,      descriptions or narrations; we identify, what is evaluated as good or bad      and trace it back to the underlying norms behind that judgments;</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Comparison:      According to our topics, we compare the chosen sequences in all interviews      to identify the most common, shared and dominant cognitive and normative pattern;</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Identification      of Rules: Related to the social conditions, we identify the typical rules      of interpretation and action that are common, acknowledged and dominant;</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. Contextualization:      In order to find out, under which social conditions they are produced, we      relate these cognitive and normative patterns to the social context of actor      constellations, cultures, opportunity structures and constraints, in which      they appear;</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. Explanation:      Taking into consideration already established explanation frames and theories,      we try to explain, why these rules are reproduced or changed in the social      context that we analyze, and what the social consequences of these rules are.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CMA, as we    use it, does not work with cases, but with dimensions, that enables a cross-comparison    of interviews with the help of encoded sequences. Our interpretation was carried    out with the help of the content analysis software MAXQDA<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>    that supports the encoding of sequences. It is executed both by interpretational    groups with a heterogeneous structure and by native speakers. Where the interviews    have been carried out in English or have been translated into English the interpretation    is executed by groups composed of international team members. The reliability    of encoding and interpretation is checked several times and showed satisfactory    results for the focus of interest that is, the main cognitive and normative    patterns of argumentation and interpretation. In parallel, a linkage could be    established between encoded passages at several important points in such a way    that the narratives framing the patterns of interpretation became identifiable.    As a result, CMA turned out to be applicable internationally and was practicable    and efficient. The aim of the next chapter (4) is therefore to show case, how    this method is applied practically in concrete scientific research.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>IV.

Altogether, we carried out    33 interviews with CEOs of the Top 100 industrial enterprises in Brazil. The    sampling method was proportional quota sampling. Furthermore, in the selection    of interviewees, an age cohort design was implemented, comparing three age groups:    CEOs and Ex-CEOs born between 1930 and 1944 (older generation), between 1945    and 1954 and CEOs born between 1955 and 1964 (younger generation).<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>    The type of survey was a problem-centered strategy of inquiry with open questions    and enough space for narrations. As analytical strategy, we used the CMA in    its light version as described above.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The research project    investigates the collective routines and scripts that channel top managers'    interpretations as well as their search for solutions to common objective problems    that they encounter in their profession, (for example the question of how to    act in the frame of global financial markets (see Pohlmann &amp; Lim 2014).    The main thrust of this approach is also derived from Max Weber who was interested    in habitual ideas and principles that composed a new spirit of capitalism. One    purpose of the research project was therefore to challenge or provide empirical    proof to the general assumption in globalization literature, that an emerging    global economic elite acts as pacemakers of a new neoliberal spirit in the world,    using neoliberal management concepts and techniques at the corporate level (see    Boltanski &amp; Chiapello 2005; Schmidt-Wellenburg 2009; Crouch 2011, etc.).    By the way, the recent literature on neoliberalism shares the assumption that    a spread of neoliberal ideas and a strong tendency of convergence towards neoliberal    management thinking is occurring in the central regions of the world economy    (Boltanski &amp; Chiapello 2005; Crouch 2011, p. 92; Streeck 2013, p. 45-46,    58-59). Although numerous studies have already made the case for divergence    or "path-dependency" in models of management and business systems (Whitley 1999;    Hall &amp; Soskice 2001; Amable 2003), "the convergence literature is the longest-established    viewpoint" (Clegg 2012). For the purpose of this article, one important feature    of neoliberal management thinking has been selected: the financial market driven    economic thinking (a financial market mindset (see Schmidt-Wellenburg 2009,    p. 327). This feature of neoliberal management thinking includes two basic indicators:    an understanding of enterprises as financial market investments and a strong    shareholder value orientation towards the market capitalization of the firm.    It makes up one of the most important parts of neoliberal management thinking    (<i>idem</i>, p. 325-335). In the following object lesson, we use the interview    sample from Brazil, but to provide a showcase, just one interview sequence is    analysed intensely.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>i</i>) <b>Selection</b>:    The first step of the interpretation is to select sequences from the texts (in    our case from the transcribed interviews) related to the guiding research question.    These sequences should be possible answers to the significant and "objective"    action problem that most actors have to cope with. In our project, the "objective"    challenge for capitalist producers was: how to act when exposed to the global    spread of financial markets. Generally those sequences might be easily detected    if - in preparation - the whole interview transcript has already been coded    based on a code tree generated in our case by theoretical considerations or    inductively elaborated. Based on this, we chose one promising sequence on financial    market orientation of a Brazilian Top Manager to begin with. It is not really    important which promising sequence one starts with because a cross comparison    of all promising sequences will be carried out anyway, in step 5.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"[...] here we      have a situation with opportunities ahead. However depending on how you act,      it could get a trap, a risk, a thread. [...] Financial market offers chances      to capitalize your company. On the other hand, if you don't have a clear position      concerning your goals and strategies, the financial market leads you to short      term orientation [...] if you are not able to make clear your position towards      the Fund, you have to play the game of short term management, and this can      be very risky" (Brazilian CEO, younger generation).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>ii</i>) <b>Reformulation</b>:    After this first step of choosing a promising sequence, the arguments, explanations    or narrations from the text sequence need to be rephrased using other words    than those of the interviewee. In this way, we try to create summarized and    reformulated sequences. The rephrasing step makes it possible to attain a structure    of the text that is more abstract so that the logical and normative aspects    of the sequence can be identified. This is how we rephrase the sequence:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Financial Markets      offer opportunities and chances to capitalize your company. There could be      also risks and traps involved. It all depends on you. If you don't have clear      goals and strategies, financial markets lead you to short term management.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In our rephrasing,    we exclude all information that is not absolutely necessary to understand the    statement of the interviewee.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>iii</i>) <b>Abstraction</b>:    For this step it is not completely necessary to understand already the logic    of the collective mindsets behind the basic line arguments of the sequence.    The focus of our interest lies primarily in finding abstract categories - a    precondition for the reconstruction of the causal (cognitive structure) and    the normative relation to the knowledge stock which will be reconstructed. These    abstract categories can just be enumerated, because in the next step we analyse    the cognitive and normative structure by using the categories as stirrup holders    for the reconstruction:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The Order      and the Functioning of markets;</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The role of      market players (funds, owners, managers);</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The consequences      of financial market involvement for industrial managers.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>iv</i>) <b>Abstraction    of order</b>: Now we approach the level of reconstructing cognitive and normative    structures in the knowledge stock by reducing and abstracting it to the knowledge    forms and norms, that have generated the statement at hand, the "derivation".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. We first ask    how the order and the functioning of markets is perceived in order to identify    what kind of collective mindset is articulated:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Financial Markets    imply the logic of short-termism. It is not an irrational system out of control    for industrial managers. It can be played (controlled) by industrial managers    in order to capitalize the company. It offers opportunities only under the condition    of a clear strategy towards the funds. Confused and non-strategic players will    be trapped. Short termism is a trap. <i>The cognitive structure thus relies    on a game theory of markets, based on rational-choice assumptions about the    control of the game and the success of strategic players</i>. Thus, it is the    actor's fault, if the company does not succeed, not the fault of the financial    market system.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. We ask secondly,    what typified role of market players lie at the center of the cognitive structure    of the collective mindset:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The manager is    at the centre of this game, not the shareholders or stockholders of the company.    <i>He is willing to play the game also against the interests of the owners of    shares in order to protect the company against them</i>. If he acts rationally,    he will be in control of the market and its funds.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. In the third    place, we ask how the consequences of financial market involvement of the company    is classified in this collective mindset:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the manager    has a clear position and strategy towards the funds/owners, he can play the    financial markets with gains. Confused and non-strategic players will be trapped.    Short termism is a trap.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning the    cognitive structure of the collective mindsets in use, we now have to realize,    that the knowledge inventory activated, is on the one hand a simple version    of actor rationality in a trivial market game, leaving out all structural effects    that are also very often addressed in the case of financial markets. On the    other hand, it reflects the role of the managers as the only agent, who acts    for the sake of the survival and expansion of the company. Even without the    ownership of significant stocks or shares, managers are taking over the functional    role of the old style entrepreneur.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subsequently, we    have to analyse the normative order that is organizing the statement. To get    to know better, how to do this, we should concentrate on value- or belief oriented    dimensions. We are asking now what is right or wrong, not in an instrumental    reasoning, but in an ethical dimension, of how one should act in this situation    in order to cope with this problem, independent of whether it will lead to success.    The underlying norm in this statement is to relate the manager's action to the    responsibility for the company, its survival and expansion. It is an entrepreneurial    norm, which managers should follow, if he does the right thing, because owners    don't do anymore. Thus, the manager is in charge for the company's long-term    orientations. His responsibility is also to avoid short termism, although short    termism could be profitable and in the interest of the owners. In the normative    structure of the collective mindset in use, <i>the norms of ethically good behaviour    are defined in a very traditional way as if the manager were the captain of    the ship that should not be wrecked by the owner's economic (profit-oriented)    interests</i>. It is his ethical duty not to follow the owner's interests and    to steer the ship through the strong currents of the financial markets, siren    calls and pitfalls included.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>v</i>) <b>Comparison</b>:    Within the same interview the sequences are now to be compared with each other    to analyze and identify the most common, shared and dominant cognitive and normative    patterns of interpretation. In a second step, this comparison can be made among    sequences of different interviews in the same economy and in a third step, a    cross comparison can be carried out between different interviews from different    economies. The purpose of the fifth step is already to generalize the findings    in identifying a common and dominant cognitive and normative pattern. Equipped    with findings about the text's cognitive and normative structures and having    them confirmed by consulting further sequences of the respective interview,    it is then easy to cross-compare those findings with other interviews to identify    similarities or differences. In the case of financial market orientation - just    to illustrate this step of analysis, not showing the analysis of the sequences    itself - the following interview sequences show a similarity in structure.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"You have to      analyze, what you want. There are different kinds of funds, and then before      you open your company for a fund, firstly you should know, what you want from      your partner, what you expect from your business partner. You want a fund      that is just speculative? [...] nobody will buy part of his business for fun,      but so that the company perpetuates, or towards you can do that the company      grows, that the company develops" (Brazilian CEO, younger generation).</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I think, the      capital market is important for company's growth [...] I'm in favour of the      financial market, I think that the financial market is indispensable, I think      it is ideal. Today there are a lot of companies that have lost control. Their      stocks are available openly to be bought and sold. [...] I think, that is      correct, but it is necessary to be careful with this [opening up of your company]      [...] I think that is the way for big companies to grow and to get stronger,      but you have to avoid exaggerations" (Brazilian CEO, older generation, retired).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of comparing    the analyzed sequence with other segments of text in the same group of interviewees    is to adjust and refine the findings elaborated so far. In addition to that,    this step is useful to analyse, whether the analysed interpretation pattern    can be found in the structure of other interviews. In both quotations above,    we find almost the same features of the collective mindset in use that we reconstructed    from the first quotation: <i>a trivial model of financial markets with a fiction    of control and the manager's role of taking care for the company, and not just    for the profits of the owners.</i> Of course, if we would check now on all 33    interviews, we would find some variations and differentiation of the collective    mindsets in use as well as some minor collective mindsets that are more in favour    of shareholder value orientations. But by and large, the dominant collective    mindset in use is one of financial markets that are identified as a hazardous    opportunities for strategic players with the dominant operating rule: to play    the game for the sake of the company and not merely for the sake of the shareholders.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>vi</i>) <b>Identification    of Rules</b>: The main objective of this step is to find common rules of interpretation    and action in the analyzed sequence group (<a href="#f1">Table 1</a>).</font></p>     <p align="center"><a name="f1"></a></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n52/02f01.jpg"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this step, we    approach even more the center of an institutional analysis focused on cognitive    and normative institutions by identifying the collectively accepted rules on    how to interpret and how to act in the frame of financial markets. Comparing    these rules with the two basic indicators for a neoliberal financial market    mindset: an understanding of enterprises as financial market investments and    a strong shareholder value orientation towards the market capitalization of    the firm, we find that only the first one - although very ambivalent - is confirmed    by our findings related to the knowledge stocks in use and the cognitive and    normative institutions at work in the Top Management of Brazilian big business    groups. The hypothesis about the spread of shareholder value orientations has    to be rejected for the Top Management in Brazilian companies. Of course, there    may be some tendency towards neoliberal collective mindsets at work, but the    dominant collective mindset in use is, that managers should play the financial    market system by, not following the short-term economic interests of their shareholders.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>vii</i>) <b>Contextualization</b>:    We now need to check under which social conditions the collective mindsets are    produced and reproduced. Related to the cognitive and normative patterns are    the social context of actor constellations, cultures, opportunity structures    and constraints, in which they appear. In the case of financial market orientations,    on the one hand, we refer to the context of the analyzed interviews, such as    the structure of the companies in relation to the financial market, the ownership    structure, the economic sector and branches they are in etc. On the other hand,    we elaborate on the corporate governance system in Brazil, especially concerning    the role of financial markets. Here we deal with the business system and its    historical development in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To avoid going    beyond the scope of this showcase only a brief summary of this step of analysis    is presented.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Informations    Concerning the Firms and the CEOS</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sequences used    in this showcase were selected from interviews with different native Brazilian    CEOs. All interviews were carried out with Top-Managers of big industrial companies    especially in the chemical, petrochemical and fuel sectors. The specific context    of this institutional as well as the concrete historical background needs to    be examined.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The company that    the CEO in the first interview sequence presides over is one of the biggest    companies in Brazil in its branch. It was founded long ago as a family firm    and became soon after a shareholder owned company. Actually this firm is part    of a conglomerate group that owns more than 50% of the total shares of this    company. The other roughly 49% are owned by different funds. The third interview    sequence was carried out with a retired CEO of the same enterprise. This retired    CEO is a member of the owner's family group. The second interview sequence was    carried out with a CEO of a big Brazilian company in the fuel sector. The company    was founded after World War II as a cooperative and is since the 2000s, listed    at the stock market. Most shares are owned by the former members of the association,    just 1% of the shares are dispersed in the public stock market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All quotations    are from CEOs of Brazilian company groups, that have been exposed themselves    to the financial markets, but still are in control of the major shares. Their    corporate strategies in front of the financial markets have obviously been to    keep control of the shares, and not to open up the companies fundamentally to    investment funds, although in the first case, shareholders with a significant    share of stocks are already able to intervene. But we'll see that the corporate    strategies - concerning the challenge to "control" the financial markets - fit    to the collective mindsets in use.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All quoted interviewees    had an insider career, having in average more than 15 years tenure in the same    firm. Thus, we now have informations on the biographical context that help to    understand, why the survival and the expansion of the company is so important    in the collective mindsets applied.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CEOs of the    first and second interview sequence hold a bachelor and a master degree in economics    whereas the retired CEO holds a bachelor degree in law studies. This is important,    because the basic idea on the diffusion of neoliberal spirit is that economic    sciences and business administration are the seedbeds of neoliberal ideas in    corporate governance, promoting their diffusion. Concerning the collective mindsets    in use, we cannot confirm this hypothesis for our sample of 33 Top-Managers    in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The Corporate    Governance System in Brazil and the Role of Financial Markets</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1980s liberalisation    became more important in Brazil's policy and though Brazil was the last country    in Latin America to implement a neoliberal economic policy (Figueiras 2000),    it attracted foreign investors as the Brazilian economy became more open (cf.    Gon&ccedil;alves 2001, p. 279). Concurrently many state owned enterprises passed    into private hands. The so-called liberal age had begun - this period is the    basis for the subsequent implementation of a neoliberal economic and financial    policy. The transnationalization of big national conglomerates was promoted    as well as acquisitions of shares in Brazilian companies. Brazil seemed to be    then more dependent on international capital flows (see Figueiras 2000) and    critical authors believe that Brazil's economic structures have become more    and more dependent on international capital markets (<i>idem</i>) and, that    due to globalization Brazil's industry was de-nationalized and subordinated    at the global level. In accordance with Figueiras (<i>idem</i>) Brazil's economy    is dominated by finance capital respectively by big international banks and    their products like pension funds and investment funds. The benefits of the    new corporate governance system are said to be achieved only by a few national    companies (cf. Bresser-Pereira &amp; Diniz 2013), that are either competitive    enough or have merged with foreign investors or are itself positioned multinational    or transnational.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a consequence    of this neoliberal policy, Brazil's industrial sector was fundamentally restructured.    Bankruptcies, corporate mergers of Brazilian enterprises and acquisitions by    multinationals were characteristic of this period. All in all, there was a de-nationalization    of the former national Brazilian economy. This resulted in increased number    of transnational enterprises and companies as well as conglomerates (see Figueiras    2000; Bresser-Pereira &amp; Diniz 2013).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning ownership    structure, the Brazilian state still is one of the predominant owners of the    largest Brazilian firms, irrespective of the economic sector. The second most    relevant owners amongst the largest Brazilian firms are families. Such family-owned    business groups can be in control of many corporations at the same time. In    the Brazilian case, the most common structure of such business groups is a pyramidal    ownership. This kind of ownership structure is an important instrument to keep    control of a firm's shareholders. The pyramidal ownership structure is used    to separate the cash flow ownership from their control rights by shares with    different voting rights (Rabelo &amp; Vasconcelos 2002; Rabelo 1998). Brazilian    companies as a rule have "clear control blocks formed by a small group of shareholders"    (Rabelo &amp; Vasconcelos 2002, p. 324). In summary, the main actors in the    Brazilian economy are the state, local family-owned business groups and affiliates    of multinational corporations. Even though foreign affiliates play an important    role in Brazil's economy since the beginning of the 1960s, local family-owned    business groups dominate the Brazilian economy. Therefore, the ownership structure    in Brazil is till now rather concentrated. What we've found out, when we checked    the context of the individual firms, can now be generalized for the corporate    governance system in Brazil. It fits to the collective mindsets in use and helps    to explain, why we don't find a strong shareholder value orientiation in the    collective mindsets behind the corporate strategies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>viii</i>) <b>Explanation</b>:    Checking the context of the interviews, we already identified some crucial factors    that help us to explain what kind of knowledge inventory was evoked when Top    Managers were confronted with the challenge of how to act in the financial market    system. In particular, we took the careers of the CEOs, the corporate strategies,    and the corporate governance system in Brazil into account. In the following,    we present theoretical foundations to corroborate the explanation of our findings.    In our case, we draw on the institutional theory of organizations and economies:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Analysing the    regulative institutions of corporate governance system in Brazil, their impact    on the articulation of collective mindsets by Brazilian Top Managers was striking.    The cognitive and normative institutions at work are thus influenced by the    regulative institutions in a country and the institutional environment of the    company. These findings confirm that we have to take the unwritten institutional    rules, cognitive frames and belief systems in use seriously into account (see    Streeck &amp; Yamamura 2001; Whitley 1999) to explain, why we did not find proof    for the convergent spread of neoliberal mindsets with regard to financial markets    all over the global economy. From a sociological perspective, institutions not    only prevail because of the advantages that firms have when operating in line    with regulative institutional settings and rules (see Hall &amp; Soskice 2001).    They also require habitualization, based on internalization and socialization    processes, which forms a culturally inherited knowledge stock that is telling    us how to act, <i>e.g.</i> when faced with the opportunity of more or less financial    market participation. Thus bearing the comparative research framework in mind,    this line of reasoning helps us to explain why the collective mindsets vary    across countries and do not show tendencies of convergence (see Pohlmann &amp;    Lim 2014).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Concerning the    neoliberal management mindset and the adoption of neoliberal management techniques,    new institutional theory correctly points out that organizations very often    adopt what is modern and the flavour of the year, without applying it to the    degree where operations and procedures are substantially changed. Window dressing,    gaming the system, hidden agendas and unwritten rules are all very common features    within new institutional theory (Meyer &amp; Rowan 1977: DiMaggio &amp; Powell    1991, etc.). The application of the idea of "playing the financial market system"    is limited, to the extent that the Brazilian managers are still able to control    the logic of the financial market system. When confronted with the uncertainty    of markets, managers tend to use fictions of control or causal maps in order    to ensure their ability to act (see Weick 1995). These are cognitive institutions    that are established <i>e.g.</i> as "trivial models" of markets to ease the    burden of complexity and to stabilize the collective mindset, which assumes    that rational players with strategic capabilities will play the financial markets    successfully.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The Top Managers    in Brazil are "organizational men", who spent most of their career in one company.    When the owners, shareholders or principals no longer take an active interest    in the survival and expansion of the company, only the top managers are left    with the task to protect the company. Thus, the professional role of top managers    - understood as organizational men or women, who have mostly climbed the career    ladder within a particular company - is rather a barrier to the spread of a    neoliberal mindset at the group level and within the real economy. The cognitive    institutions at work did change, however. The collectively favoured role-model    is no longer to be acting as an agent for the principal(s), but instead: to    behave like an old-style entrepreneur in charge of the company's survival and    expansion. Of course, the global financial crisis since 2007 has had a strong    periodic effect on the revival of this collective mindset that places special    emphasis on the "entrepreneurial self" of managers, too.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neoliberal management    thinking is of course only a small cog in the big wheel of neoliberalism. However,    our empirical findings show that top managers in Brazil do not act as neoliberal    "switchmen" who were expected to accelerate the trend towards a financial market-driven    economy. A deep empirical investigation is crucial to explore further and demonstrate    how collective mindsets become resilient and culturally rooted vis-&agrave;-vis    the claims of mainstream globalization literature.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>V. Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of    this paper was to introduce the method of CMA, which was developed and used    within the scope of a research project on economic elites. We gave a concrete    example from the research project on economic elites in Brazil. Analysing the    collective mindsets helped us gain deeper insights into the institutional conditions    of social action and interaction. It served to identify types of collective    knowledge and partly the conditions that are required to activate them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From this perspective,    the advantages of the CMA-method are:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>i</i>) The    CMA in its "light version" supports a comparative institutional analysis of    various societies, cultures or economies. It complements the focus on regulative    institutions that are predominantly addressed by researchers in institutional    analysis.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>ii</i>) In    analysing collectively acknowledged cognitive and normative rules (institutions)    it is a valid and reliable method. It helps to remedy the shortcomings of the    rather idiosyncratic approach to cognitive and normative cultures within the    mainstream literature on institutions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>iii</i>) It    does not rely on a few single case studies that would require intensive efforts    at reconstruction. With the cross-comparison of interview sequences, it is well-suited    for an expansion towards the cross-comparison of many interviews in different    countries, thus mapping the knowledge stocks in a given society, culture or    economy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>iv</i>) Although,    at first glance, the effort of interpretation seems to be high, this method    is very efficient. In our experience, most of the time there are not many collective    mindsets in use. The reconstruction of one collective mindset is very often    seminal for the classification of many interview sequences.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>v</i>) The    CMA allows for the application of a strictly qualitative design as well as of    a mixed research design, with a bigger number of guided interviews to be analysed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>vi</i>) The    method of the CMA is very close to a scientifist' method of interpretating scientific    texts, when analysing studies of fellow scholars or other scientists. Thus,    every scientist has already experiences in the analysis of cognitive and normative    structures with regard to scientific texts.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But of course the    CMA has also certain limitations or disadvantages:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>i</i>) Just    like any other qualitative method, it is not easy to generate a collectively    shared understanding of the technique; especially of how the process of drawing    conclusions can be made transparent and controlled. The need for training all    the participating analysts is certainly high.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>ii</i>) The    need for training is also high, because the analyst has to avoid what very often    comes natural: to elaborate on the subjective meaning, or on the potential motives    of the interviewees. Also, it is not easy to dismiss all information on the    context and the social position of the interviewee that is available (except    those that are necessary to understand the sequence at hand), when starting    with the interpretation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>iii</i>) Working    in international and culturally heterogeneous interpretation groups with a dominant    role of native speakers, sometimes the inter-coder reliability has to be checked.    At least two separate interpretation groups should then work on the same interview    sequences independently and compare their findings and conclusions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>iv</i>) The    level of abstraction of the interpretation can differ greatly, depending on    the scientific competence, experience and data interpretation skills of the    analysts. Eventually, this process is only to be controlled by the interpretation    group.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>v</i>) Applying    the CMA to map collectively accepted knowledge stocks doesn't answer the question    about the conditions at work that activate or enact these knowledge stocks (by    forming individual attitudes). Thus, a macro-micro-macro link isn't conceptualized    theoretically.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(<i>vi</i>) Checking    the results of our CMA in various cultures, it was striking that the method    is biased towards elaborating archetypes of knowledge, and is not that sensitive    to the more recent forms of collective mindsets. That is why the derivations    - <i>i.e.</i> individual attitudes - were strongly influenced by the socialization    of an actor.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite these limitations,    we assume that the CMA is a useful method for cross-cultural comparison and    a seminal part of thorough institutional analysis. It provides clear results    without excessive hermeneutical efforts. According to our experience, the method    has turned out to be practicable and suitable to international comparative research.    In particular, due to the following three reasons: It enables us to understand    the various cultural framings that modify the approach to the knowledge stocks.    It provides a clear framework for comparisons that is avoiding the flaws of    a point-by-point method of comparison. It further enables us to reconstruct    the cultural "software" of collectively accepted knowledge stocks and generates    new insights into the institutional order of a society. Thus, the CMA is - based    on our experience - a seminal qualitative method for an institutional analysis    that aims at an appropriate methodological approach to the cognitive and normative    frames of action in a given society, culture or economy. It should be employed    on a regularly basis to complement the analysis of regulative institutions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Allert, T. 1976.

We prefer the term "Collective Mindsets", because it is more instructive for    an understanding of the sociology of knowledge-frame in use.    <br>   <a name="back3"></a><a href="#top3">3</a> Ideologies are related to status-based    material interests of an actor or actor groups. Collective Mindsets are not    generated, applied or reproduced by individual benefits and utilities. As cultural    habits of thinking and acting, they are historical forms of knowledge, which    do not evolve due to interests and benefits but because of historical opportunities,    contingency and adaptive advantages. Habituation, internalization and naturalization    are the mechanisms of their reproduction, not the realization of status interests    or benefits.    <br>   <a name="back4"></a><a href="#top4">4</a> MAXQDA is software designed for qualitative    and mixed methods data, particularly for analyses of data from interviews, focus    groups, online surveys, web pages, images, audio and video files, spreadsheets,    and RIS data easily in academic, scientific, and business institutions. The    emphasis on going beyond qualitative research can be observed in the extensive    attributes function and the ability of the program to deal relatively quickly    with larger numbers of interviews (see Kuckartz 2012).    <br>   <a name="back5"></a><a href="#top5">5</a> The purpose of this age group comparison    was to find out if there is an age cohort effect on the characteristics of the    collective mindsets in use and to assess the changes in collective mindsets,    although the project could not use longitudinal data.</font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

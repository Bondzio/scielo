This article aims to analyze key aspects of Brazil's historical formation as elaborated by Caio Prado Jr. in his main works on Brazilian history, Evolução Política do Brasil (1933), The Colonial Background of Modern Brazil (published in Portuguese in 1942; first English edition in 1967), and História Econômica do Brasil (1945). The author analyzes how Caio Prado Jr. engages in a dialogue with Marxist thought in his approach to the "revolution of independence" as a watershed in the historical development of Brazilian society.

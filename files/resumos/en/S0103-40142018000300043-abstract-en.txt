ABSTRACT In this paper, we present and discuss issues concerning the planning and implementation of Physics lessons focused on both teaching and learning. We highlight the role of inquiry and argumentative practices as central to approaching Physics in the classroom. We present the essential knowledge that Physics teachers must consider in their professional activity, and highlight some actions that can be performed in their initial training.

Abstract This article is part of a work in progress about anthropological works that focus on cities, although not explicitly classified in the field of Urban Anthropology. Two books of the British anthropologist Ruth Finnegan - The hidden musicians (2007 [1989]) and Tales of the City (2004 [1998]) - are analyzed, that approached the English town of Milton Keynes (with 255,000 inhabitants and 70km from London). The final part of the article presents a brief visit to the city that illluminates certain contextual relationships between the two books through a confluence of interactions that allowed a step forward in the intended study.

The Rural Credit (RC) law and the New Forest Code (NFC) were both born in 1965 and, contrarily to what one might suppose, they shared the common goal of increasing agricultural productivity. However, the RC neither requires compliance with NFC nor with tributary and social security laws, what takes economic returns as priority against environmental conservation and rural social development.

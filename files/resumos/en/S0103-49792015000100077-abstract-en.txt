The article analyzes Guerreiro Ramos&#8217; criticisms of the UNESCO proposal to promote a series of studies on race relations in Brazil in the early 1950s. Focusing on the scholar&#8217;s work from 1946 to 1950, the article explores his criticism of the tradition of African-Brazilian studies, his approaches to color prejudice from the perspective of the intersection of sociology with social psychology, and his thoughts on the need to forge a black intelligentsia in order to combat racial discrimination in Brazil. Although Guerreiro Ramos&#8217; proposal to replace the UNESCO academic research agenda with an International Conference on Race was not embraced, the idea had the unexpected effect of contributing to the expansion and diversification of UNESCO studies. The latter changes were facilitated by an open-ended scenario made possible by the autonomous work of a Transatlantic network of progressive social scientists who had diverse experiences in teaching and/or research in Brazil and who were sensitive to the demands presented at the First Brazilian Black Congress, sponsored by the Black Experimental Theater (TEN).

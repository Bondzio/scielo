Abstract This article is dedicated to analyze the political participation of bolivian and paraguayan migrants, in coordination with the national population, claim urbanization and housing in the slums of Buenos Aires. IÂ´ll present part of the cartography of discussions of a specific group of residents of villas that, regardless of national origin, they share common problems and demand to be recognized as citizens of the city and militants fighting for housing. The proposal is to focus two aspects little observed by the field of migration studies: a) the centrality of the urban scale for the study of migration and b) the claim as a fundamental political practice in everyday life (urban) of migrants. The objective is to offer a reflection on the complex links between policy, class and nationality that open from a local bidding process for urban land and the right to the city.

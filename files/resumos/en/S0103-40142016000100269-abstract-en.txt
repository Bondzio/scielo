Law no.12,965, enacted on April 23, 2014, known as "Marco Civil da Internet" [the Internet Bill of Rights] aimed to establish principles, guarantees, rights and obligations for Internet users in Brazil. Although its approval was celebrated, supposedly because current legal provisions - like the Federal Constitution, the Civil Code and the Criminal Code - are not applicable in the social relations set forth by the Internet, the law presents few innovations and many legal problems and deficiencies. Furthermore, in addition to the legal impossibility of regulating a global computer network through the laws of a single country, the problems generated by the Internet will continue to affect people's privacy, reputation and image, while alleged achievements, such as net neutrality, will have little impact on people's lives.

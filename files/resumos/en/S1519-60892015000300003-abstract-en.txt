Abstract: We study in Darcy Ribeiro&#8217;s thought his reception of the utopia of a Great Nation that gained more strength in the book Nuestra America, of José Martí. We intend to capture Ribeiro&#8217;s central argument, namely, its diagnosis of the causes of the uneven development in the subcontinent, which can serve to overcome a self-deprecating view that would see Latin America as an unfortunate reflection of the Northern modernity. We understand, from this perspective, Darcy Ribeiro as a participant of the intellectual movement that anticipates the &#8220;decolonial turn&#8221; by criticism of the hegemonic modern meta-narrative, so that his anthropology presents in an unprecedented manner the American people in the world&#8217;s civilizational process not as an outdated expression of a history already experienced by northern populations in past times, but as unique and concomitant ethnic conformations in modern capitalism.

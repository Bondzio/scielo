Abstract In April 2010, the Federal Supreme Court brought to trial the ADPF 153. Proposed in October 2008 by the Federal Council of the Brazilian Bar Association, ADPF 153 questioned the current interpretation of the Amnesty Law (Law 6.683/1979), according to which those involved in the crimes committed by the repressive apparatus would have been automatically amnestied by this norm. This study analyzes the impact that the process of transition to Brazilian democracy has had on the new political scenario that began with the end of the dictatorship, verifying the connections between the position issued by the highest judicial court and the way that occurred the transition to democracy.

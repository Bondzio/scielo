Abstract: This paper analyzes the relationships between living conditions, sensibilities and actions, to understand the ways in which the conflict may (or may not) emerge. Secondary data from Latinobarometro are used, in 2002, the year of the last major crisis in Argentina. Employees and self-employed, women and men are compared. Analysis shows that there is inaction under two different but complementary approaches: individualism/solidarism and individualism/bearability. This quantitative approach is not intended to exhaust the proposed concepts and relationships between variables, but encourage the possibilities of understanding of the current capitalist structuration.

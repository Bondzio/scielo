Abstract The use of internet as a medium for political participation, also known as electronic political participation, represents a sociological issue of growing interest, though a review of literature shows scarce empirical researches about this subject. This paper presents a research developed from a survey data collection (sample of 389 individuals) having as a main goal to map the political culture and participation in the Pampa (more specifically, the city of SÃ£o Borja, west frontier of Rio Grande do Sul). The paper analyzes the relation between a typology of internet users (an electronic political participation typology) and civic practices: a civicness index derived from indicators of participation and involvement in civic associations. The analysis demonstrates that political engagement in social networks or other digital media is not the reason why people engage effectively in civil society organizations.

Abstract: This paper comes from the ethnography of Feministes Indignades, a commission from 15M movement, which, according to our opinion, was in transition to become a feminist collective. The ideas presented here seek to argue that this space of reflection and political practice has different traits &#8722; the most important of which is to put caring in the center and rescue the sustainability of livelihoods &#8722; consistent with what is known as the third wave feminism. Through this, that they called livable lives, these militants offer a bet for a feminist economy as a solution to the crisis that is nothing else than capitalism, as the 15M participants usually say.

The end of the Fordist employment pattern obliges researchers to reflect upon the numerous forms and differentiations assumed by work and employment. Such differentiations result in the &#8220;blurring&#8221; of the wage relationship&#8217;s boundaries and in the constitution of a &#8220;gray zone&#8221; concerning the new forms of work and employment relations. This study focuses on the configurations of self-entrepreneurship as a rising form of social integration through work, considering that work an employment no longer necessarily coincide. Rekindled tension between autonomy and subordination, noticeable in the various forms of work, renews questions on social inequality regarding social integration through work. Tensions builds up between the need to work, the concrete possibilities of entering the labor market, and the possession of objective personal resources (competences, abilities, labor market context, job offers, identification of niches and fringes in the labor and services markets, concrete possibilities for earning income) and subjective ones (desires, perspectives, personal plans, perspicacity, judgements). The association between experienced inequalities and resource mobilization creates unprecedented strategies for integration through work.

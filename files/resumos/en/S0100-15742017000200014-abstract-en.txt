ABSTRACT This article aims to reflect on the relationship between Psychoanalysis and Education as a field of knowledge produced through educational praxis. The subjective knowledge intertwined in the educational act, and the social ties produced in daily school life are the structuring dimensions of the practice and training of education professionals, regarding the subject&#8217;s relation to desire and knowledge. In contrast to the traditional view of Psychology &#8220;applied to Education&#8221;, a different interpretation of Psychoanalysis has contributed to our thinking on the social ties produced in the name of Education as an open path for reflection on the subject&#8217;s involvement in teacher training and teaching profession.

Abstract This article analyses the new rearrangements and trends of capital and labour regarding the new forms of organising the capital and labour as well the mobilities and control of both, which emerged from the political, economic, social and cultural changes of the last four decades. We argue that by highlighting the contemporary trends and contradictions of capital and labour, focusing on deregulatory disposition on one hand and on regulatory disposition on the other, we can see the formation of processes of differential mobilities (and inclusions) as well a growing situation of precariousness in the contemporary social life. This article is based, empirically, on a range of studies developed at the Laboratory of Work, Professions and Mobility, at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos, which include researches conducted on workers in Brazil as well as on Brazilian immigrants in London.

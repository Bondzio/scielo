This article aims to analyze the statistical tables that show to whom public schools in the city of Rio de Janeiro cater and how they perform between 1922 and 1935. These tables were published by the Federal District General Board of Public Instruction and featured the schools' catering capacity and grade repetition and drop-out rates in the city's education system. The main discussion concerns the development of enrollment, attendance and promotion indexes of Rio's public schools during the reforms led by Antonio de Arruda Carneiro Leão (1922-1926), Fernando de Azevedo (1927-1930) and Anísio Teixeira (1931-1935). The official statistics are examined in order to understand the expansion of the catering capacity of public schools and the control of drop-out and repetition.

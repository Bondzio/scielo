The article provides an integrated view between gender studies and visual culture studies. It seeks to interpret the figurations of women in argentine glossy magazines widely available, around 1920, to reflect on the conventions of generic distinctions, behavior emulation, social exclusion representations and articulations between them. It is proposed that the ways of characterizing bodies plays a crucial role so, the appearance, gestures and the evocation of a life style given for the elements of the scene act as iconographic formulas that support the agency of social recognition. Attention is paid to the design and production conditions of discourses, the themes developed, the devices that are used from the languages, and the potential meanings of recognition.

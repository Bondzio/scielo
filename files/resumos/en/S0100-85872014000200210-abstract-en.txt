In this article, I analyse the relationship between evangelicals and public space                through the sound practices of the &#8220;Marcha pra Jesus&#8221; (&#8220;March for Jesus&#8221;). The &#8220;March                for Jesus&#8221;, which happens annually in hundreds of cities, is a parade in which people                through places seen as important to the city, accompanied by gospel songs sung                loudly. In these events, religion, culture industry (market) and political, commonly                imagined as distinct, are connected through the sound. A collectivity of                &#8220;evangelicos&#8221; ir performed and engaged through sound practices in the &#8220;batalha                spiritual&#8221; for the city.

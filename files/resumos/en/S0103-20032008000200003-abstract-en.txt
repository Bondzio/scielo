Studies indicate the existence of a situation of underdevelopment in the southern half of Rio Grande do Sul, directly correlated with the farming and rice culture crises. The later suffers from the macroeconomic policies linked to the opening of the economy and with the pressures of the increase of competitiveness. This process has made the region present inferior performances than State averages when indicators such as GDP and per capita income are analyzed. Seeking to reduce these inequalities, governmental sectors have been elaborating development strategies through the utilization of the regional agricultural vocation as well as the insertion of differentiated chains in local agribusiness. One of these experiences is the Program for the Development of Irrigated Fruit Culture in the Southern Half/RS. Within this context, this article has the objective of presenting the results observed in the GDP and HDI of two municipalities located in the Campanha Region of Rio Grande do Sul, and also to present the effects observed on the life quality of the producers after the implementation of fruit culture in their properties. Based on the data collected and the methodology chosen, it can be said that the productive diversification of rural properties contributes in the improvement of the producers' life quality, having positive effects on the per capita GDP and HDI of the municipalities studied.

Abstract The present review looks into the work of Gregory Claeys that maps what he calls the natural history of dystopia, aiming to account for the passage, in society, from natural fears (gods, monsters) to social fears (oppressive technologies, totalitarianism). I will analyze how the author seeks, by examining historical facts, myths, religions, political systems and the so-called &#8220;dystopic literature&#8221;, to deal with the behavioral-emotional dimension and the sensations that define dystopias for different groups and societies. Thereby, not only scenarios and works projected as dystopic are considered, but also past and present contexts so characterized: the task is precisely to alert and educate about the real-life dystopias. Considering the present political-socioeconomic context, it is an effort that intends to induce envisioning collective solutions in moments of growing irrationality and panic.

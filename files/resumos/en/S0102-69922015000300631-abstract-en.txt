An analysis of such lack of consensus is the main goal of this paper. A literature review since the labor theory of value until contemporary research is undertaken. The conceptual and methodological is made regarding the European Working Condition Surveys, whose questionnaire and reports are analyzed about subjectivity and objectivity and the relations of the empirical practices with conceptual definitions. This essay of conceptual and methodological critique aims at contributing with the formulation of parameters that may contribute with the making of necessary researches regarding the Brazilian context, given the implications of the labor intensification process on health conditions of the working people.

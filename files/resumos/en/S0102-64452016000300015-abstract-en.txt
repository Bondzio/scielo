Abstract Michel Foucault was one of the most important anti-humanism theoreticians deriving from structuralism. At the same time, he was a fighting militant for human rights, hence being a member of the humanist tradition of Enlightenment. It seems there is a contradiction between these two attitudes: the theoretical and the practical. This article denies it. Accordingly, it holds that the first attitude is proper to the "epistemological subject", while the second one pertains to the "empirical subject". One as much as the other can be found in the same individual, not only in Michel Foucault, for all of us are capable of being both at the same time.

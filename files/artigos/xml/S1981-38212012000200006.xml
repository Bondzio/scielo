<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>I beg your pardon: Octavio wrote a book on    what?!</i> For those familiar with previous publications and the career path    of Amorim Neto - and there are many in Brazil as well as abroad - nothing could    be more surprising than him writing a book on foreign policy. "Domestic" institutions    such as presidents, cabinets and parliaments had always been at the core of    his research, and articles in <i>World Politics</i>, <i>Comparative Political    Studies</i>, the <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, and <i>Party    Politics</i> have earned him a reputation as a quantitative-oriented, comparative    politics scholar. How - and why - could he possibly have transited from a solid    terrain that he fully mastered to uncharted territories of another social science    he had never previously published? I think two reasons should be called forth    to explain this gamble. First, it is not so infrequent for people to come back    to their first love, and diplomatic history was among Amorim Neto's earliest    and dearest interests - and remained a strong reason for his fondness for politics.    Second, and partly as a consequence of the above, he never bought into the idea    that comparative politics and international relations were separate disciplines.    Rather, as he once wrote that comparative politics was "the politics of the    others" (2010), he would most likely subscribe to Javier Solana's dictum that    "foreign policy is all about the domestic policy of others", and thus that international    relations is the arena of interaction between both comparable and entangled    units. In his understanding, all these fields of knowledge fall fully within    the sphere of power relations, which is to say that they belong to what political    science - and political scientists - study. For such an open mindset, state    borders are not stiff enough as to keep knowledge in watertight compartments    or, to paraphrase Almond (1988), separate tables. So Amorim Neto decided to    invest his methodological skills and comparatist training into a new, though    related, venture: to find out the determinants of the contemporary foreign policy    of his home country.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This book introduces three main innovations to    preexisting analyses. They regard methods, time frame and theory. As to methods,    this volume is the first systematic attempt to test with empirical data whether    it is domestic politics or the international system that have influenced more    decisively Brazilian foreign policy. Thus far, discussions had mostly been held    between arguments on continuity (accentuating the professionalism of Itamaraty    and above-politics strategies) versus change (focusing on leadership and epitomized    in the famous Lula's sentence, "never before in the history of this country").    However, both strands of arguments were defended in an impressionistic rather    than fact-based fashion and also, more often than not, ideologically biased    and normatively oriented. To overcome these pitfalls, Amorim Neto made the careful    though risky decision to use a quantitative indicator to measure the orientation    of Brazilian foreign policy, and so he resorted to a database that included    every non unanimous vote in the General Assembly of the United Nations (Voeten    e Merdzanovic 2008) to build the dependent variable, i.e., policy alignment    with the United States. It measured the degree of convergence in voting behavior    between the two countries over time and across issues, and showed that it decreased    abruptly from over 80% in the 1940s to around 10% in the 2000s.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the book shows, to consider policy alignment    with the United States as a proxy for Brazilian foreign policy at large follows    a methodological choice that is shared by virtually all scholars regardless    of paradigmatic leaning. Yet, it also brings us to the second innovation: time    span. Unlike most of the literature, Amorim Neto does not start his narrative    either with Bar&atilde;o de Rio Branco or with the preceding empire. This decision    is made on methodological grounds, as there was no UN - and therefore no voting    record - prior to 1945. But there is also a substantive reason, which is more    visible at the end than at the starting point: as US power recedes, the world    becomes more multipolar and South America gains increasing autonomy - or diversifies    its dependency, as some would say -, the degree of alignment with the US will    cease to be a valid indicator of broader foreign policy goals. Therefore, the    analysis carried out in this book was impracticable before 1946 and will become    meaningless in the forthcoming years. This acknowledgment is an author's tribute    to the importance of context, as it recognizes the limits of pure formal modeling    and blind quantitative measurement.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Concerning theory, Amorim Neto claims that his    findings vindicate the neo-realist approach, although his focus on foreign policy,    his multi-variable research design, and his conclusions put him closer to neo-classical    realism than to Waltzian or Mearsheimerian realism. In Gideon Rose's words (1998:    146-7), "neoclassical realists argue that relative material power establishes    the basic parameters of a country's foreign policy... Yet they point out that    there is no immediate or perfect transmission belt linking material capabilities    to foreign policy behavior. Foreign policy choices are made by actual political    leaders and elites, and so it is their perceptions of relative power that matter,    not simply relative quantities of physical resources or forces in being... Furthermore,    those leaders and elites do not always have complete freedom to extract and    direct national resources as they might wish. Power analysis must therefore    also examine the strength and structure of states relative to their societies,    because these affect the proportion of national resources that can be allocated    to foreign policy". In sum, neoclassical realism holds that the actions of a    state in the international system can be explained by systemic, cognitive, and    domestic variables affecting the power and freedom of action of the decision-makers    in foreign policy. If context matters, then the next question is how - and how    much.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amorim Neto decided to test the impact of nine    independent variables on the degree of voting convergence with the US. There    were three systemic variables: Brazil's position in the international hierarchy    of military and economic power, its degree of asymmetric interdependence, and    the preferences of the US. The first variable is tributary to neo-realist theory    and was measured by resorting to the Composite Index of National Capability    (CINC), a statistical measure of national power that combines six different    components representing demographic (total and urban population), economic (iron    and steel production and energy consumption), and military (expenditure and    personnel) strength. The second variable stems from liberal theories and measures    Brazilian exports to the US as a proxy for economic dependence; the third variable    regards the intensity with which the US sought to align the Western Hemisphere,    and uses a binary variable (incidence of the Cold War) to gauge it.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The six domestic variables include five ideological    or ideological-institutional measures as in Latin America the left is mostly    associated with anti-Americanism: the president's ideology, the legislative    share of his party, the ideological leaning of his cabinet, the legislative    strength of left-to-the-center parties, and the presence and weight of military    ministers in the cabinet - which is associated to the ideological right. The    latter variable captures the nature of the regime (i.e. democratic or not),    but it also provides meaningful information about democratic administrations    as every branch of the armed forces was entitled to a cabinet minister until    the creation of a civilian-ruled Ministry of Defense in 1999. Last, the sixth    variable estimates the influence of Itamaraty, the powerful foreign ministry,    by calculating diplomatic incrementalism and inertia from one year to the next.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The findings of the ensuing regressions might    have been unsettling for a scholar trained to appreciate the significance of    government institutions and domestic politics. The paramount discovery of the    book is that systemic factors were the main determinant behind the formulation    of Brazilian foreign policy between the end of World War II and 2008, a period    that encompassed eighteen different presidents. Furthermore, these factors were    not related to liberal hypotheses (asymmetric interdependence and US preferences    as defined by the Cold War) but to the neo-realist hypothesis that focused on    the increase in the country's military and economic power. True, some of the    domestic factors also showed some significance: the bureaucratic variable (diplomatic    inertia generated by the foreign ministry) and, secondarily, the cabinet strength    of leftist parties and military ministers, had a complementary effect on policy    choices. As the author warns, his tests do not exclude the possibility that    systemic-liberal factors and Congress-centered variables had <i>indirect</i>    influence over the policy process; yet, structure rather than agency took center    stage.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The primacy of high politics (national capabilities)    over low politics (interdependence), and of systemic over domestic factors,    may have disguised an element that Amorim Neto is eager to bring back to the    fore: presidential influence. As he suggests, the political support and personal    activism of the chief executive affects the way in which the bureaucratic traditions    and ideological alignments interact with each other and with the systemic pressures.    Because, as neoclassical realists argue, "systemic pressures and incentives    may shape the broad contours and general direction of foreign policy <i>without</i>    being strong or precise enough to determine the specific details of state behavior.    This means that the influence of systemic factors may often be more apparent    from a distance than from up close - for example, in significantly limiting    the menu of foreign policy choices considered by a state's leaders at a particular    time, rather than in forcing the selection of one particular item on that menu    over another" (Rose 1998: 147, my emphasis). Whether consciously or not, Rose's    take accurately depicts the author's approach and puts him in company of the    likes of Randall Schweller, William Wohlforth and Fareed Zakaria.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The research displayed in this book combines    solid statistical analysis with careful consideration of historical context    and detail. It hardly leaves loose ends, as it gives balanced consideration    to the long term as well as the nitty-gritties of specific situations. For those    who are not familiar with the Brazilian academic community, however, this book    carries an additional asset that is worth mentioning. In Brazil, unlike the    US or Argentina, political science and international relations have developed    through parallel tracks. While the former has adopted a nomothetic approach,    looking for regularities in the observable phenomena, the latter has prioritized    an idiographic approach, aspiring to illuminate the particularities of reality.    Hence, Brazilian political science evolved from sociology and became increasingly    quantitative and comparative (some would say Americanized), whereas international    relations kept a strong connection with history and favored periodization over    theorization (more in line with the French tradition). Apart from its substantive    richness, this book accomplishes the feat of seating both disciplines at the    same table and inviting them to dialogue. And it delivers, as the knowledge    produced is superior to what it would have been had the two pathways remained    separated.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So what comes next? A new avenue of research    has been opened up, and there are already young researchers drawing on its methods    and contrasting its findings (see Schenoni 2012). Two main challenges, I suggest,    lay ahead: the first is to retest whether it is Brazil's increasing national    capabilities or rather the capability gap with the United States that determines    foreign policy changes, as similar trends have been verified for most other    countries (Voeten 2004). The second challenge, linked to the previous one, is    to go deeper into combining international relations with comparative politics    and to expand this analysis to the region first, and eventually worldwide. How    does Brazilian foreign policy determinants compare with Argentina's, Mexico's    or, for that matter, India's? Could Brazil be just a regional exception? And    if it is not, does it reflect a general pattern or one that is valid just for    large powers? The jury is still out, but the scheme for reaching a judgment    has been laid out in this book.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Instilled by an eclectic approach, this research    is both theory-guided and empirically tested. Amorim Neto engages contrasting    arguments and authors, interrogates the facts and leads the reader through a    line of reasoning that is respectful but rigorous. In the end, evidence gains    primacy over expectations and new causal relations are unearthed. Yet, let justice    be done, this book might have had a lesser impact if it were not for the support    received from Maria Regina Soares de Lima, who wrote the preface. Given the    disciplinary quarrels that pervade the Brazilian scholarly community, the academic    reputation and open-mindedness of Maria Regina helped to secure an attentive    readership for such a provocative, cross-fertilizing endeavor. The book sets    the bar high for future research but, if the effort blossoms, it may also have    another lasting effect: to facilitate the rapprochement between comparatists    and internationalists and also, perhaps, between temporarily distanced members    of the Brazilian diplomatic community. May good scholarship have an influence    on the real world, out of the ivory tower.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So yes, Octavio wrote a book on foreign policy.    Why wonder? After all, he is a political scientist.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>

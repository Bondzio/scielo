Abstract This paper aims at reconstructing the space of social classes in Brazil. Its main theoretical reference is based on class studies influenced by a bourdieusian perspective, although it also attempts at incorporating insights from Marxian and Weberian class theories. The data used are part of a survey called Dimensions of Social Inequality, which contains a sample of over eight thousand households. The method of analysis combines multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis.

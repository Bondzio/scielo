Time and mode are references that impregnate the whole of Marx's work, especially when the dialectical dimension of his thought is explicitly present. Bringing to the surface this analytical nucleus is an urgent and important task if one is to renew and make the best use of this "power of negative thinking" (Marcuse). This applies especially to the central aim of the present paper, which consists in looking for elements apt to contribute to the building of a theory of social experience suitable for the new forms assumed by the world to which Marx dedicated his work, the capitalist world. With this in mind a no linear conception of the temporal dimension is presented, with the aim of giving to time its due centrality in the social processes.

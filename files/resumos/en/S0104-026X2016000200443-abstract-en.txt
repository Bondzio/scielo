Abstract: The objective of this article is to promote, through literature theoretical research, a discussion on women's use of psychoactive substances. It recognizes the need for an interdisciplinary approach, but invests in socio-cultural aspects of such practices. Gender, as a socio-cultural determinant, is prioritized. Men and women - as different social / cultural actors - retain distinct involvements with the consumption of psychoactive substances. So, this work believes that women are a differentiated segment of users, with particular characteristics and needs that should be considered by public policies. However, women themselves are not a homogeneous group. Therefore, an approach to their psychoactive substance consumption should be fully made, considering their contexts and particularities and based on a perspective of harm reduction.

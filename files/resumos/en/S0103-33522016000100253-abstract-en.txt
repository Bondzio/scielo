Abstract The debate on structural determinants of development processes in contemporary societies is broad and multifaceted. Two particularly fruitful aspects of this literature are the approaches that emphasize the institutional legacy and path dependency elements, on the one hand, and theories which are based on the political and social dynamics of these societies, in order to try to explain those structural factors. Two recent representative works of these approaches, (Kurtz, 2013) and (Huber and Stephens, 2012), are analyzed here, seeking to point out aspects of convergence between them and also the possibilities that their use open to interpret the Brazilian development experience. The article concludes that socio-centric approach to state-building, by (Kurtz, 2013), and the theory of power constellations, by (Huber and Stephens, 2012), are promising tools to contribute to the advancement of the research agenda on development in Brazil.

Abstract Using data from the Brazilian Electoral Survey (Eseb), this article investigates the feelings toward parties of Brazilian voters in 2014 and their relations to attitudinal and behavioral variables. Special emphasis is placed on antipetismo, i.e. the negative feeling toward the Workers&#8217; Party (PT) that is present among a growing segment of Brazilian voters. In addition to analyzing the evolution of these feelings between 2002 and 2014, the present work seeks to identify the sociodemographic profile of antipetista voters and the impact of such negative feelings on attitudinal variables (statism, equality, and democracy) and on vote choice. The results of this study demonstrate that positive party feelings are decreasing, especially toward the PT. They also point to the limited effects of antipetismo on political attitudes, while evidencing its great influence on electoral behavior.

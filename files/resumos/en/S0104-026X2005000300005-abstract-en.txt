This article examines some aspects of the poetical production of Maria Lúcia Dal Farra, Livro de auras (1994) and Livro de possuídos (2002), trying, mainly, an approach to the constructive mechanisms that move its poetical universes. The focus of attention centers in the use that such a poetics makes of a constructive ratio, which hovers between "canto" and "decanto" to symbolize, in a feminine way of writing, the possession of an aesthetic intellect that traditional androcentric culture has reserved for the masculine.

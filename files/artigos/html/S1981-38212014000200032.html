<p>This article deals with the State regulation of drinking water and sanitation
					services in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires. Its main objective is to
					identify the continuities and ruptures in State regulation during the transition
					from private management (1993-2006) to renationalisation and State management
					(2006 onwards). The concept of “State capacities” (both administrative and
					relational) is used to assess regulatory performance. For the administrative
					capacities, the correspondence between the design and resources of the agencies,
					as well as the differences between their formal functions and actual practices,
					is examined. For the relational capacities, the policies of the National
					Government and its interaction with both the water and sanitation companies and
					the regulatory and control agencies are considered. The analysis is based on
					official documents, legislation and statistics, company balance sheets and
					reports, newspaper articles and semi-structured interviews.</p>

<a name="idm171760"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Introduction</p>
<p>After the crisis of the Welfare State, State intervention in public utilities was
				dramatically restructured worldwide. The State no longer acted as the supplier of
				public utilities and offered their management to private operators. In this way, the
				State limited its role to regulatory and control functions. The rationale underlying
				this restructuring was that the operation of public utilities would recreate
				competition in the market rather than replace it. Following these assumptions, the
				production and supply of water and sanitation services were transferred to private
				operators, but competition in the sector was not fostered. In most of the cases, the
				monopolistic nature of the service remained.</p>
<p>Thus, the nature of water and sanitation services called for strong State regulation
				of the supply, as the utilities were now in the hands of private operators. However,
				the regulatory architecture was not sufficiently effective. As a result, private
				companies made extraordinary profits in a context characterised by asymmetric
				information problems, lack of transparency and accountability in decision-making,
				corruption and weak regulatory agencies. The well-being of the population and
				environmental protection were overlooked (<sup><a href="#B5">CASTRO,
					2004</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B9">HALL, 2002</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B10">HALL and LOBINA, 2002</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B11">2006</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B14">LOBINA and HALL,
					2003</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B23">VARGAS and SEPPÄLÄ,
				2004</a></sup>).</p>
<p>In countries where the water supplies have undergone this process, increased rates
				have been justified as a means to finance investments that ultimately did not
				materialise. In addition, recurrent contract renegotiations have resulted in
				cancellations or delays in mandatory investments. Infrastructure investments have
				been limited to maintenance and improvements take place mainly in the commercial
				aspects of the supply (<sup><a href="#B5">CASTRO, 2004</a></sup>).</p>
<p>At the beginning of this century, several international water operators exited the
				Latin American region. As a consequence, several public utilities were
				renationalised (<sup><a href="#B6">DUCCI, 2007</a></sup>). In the Buenos
				Aires Metropolitan Area, the concession was rescinded in March 2006 and the company
				Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos S.A. (AySA)[Argentine Water and Sanitation Services
				Inc.] was created by the State.</p>
<p>This article focuses on a) the creation of AySA and its performance (e.g. financial
				results, coverage levels, investments, among others) and b) the regulatory design
				that accompanied the renationalisation, and how it works (e.g. the regulatory
				framework, price structure, and regulatory agencies). We will also examine the
				continuities and ruptures in the regulatory practices from the period of private
				operation (May 1993-March 2006) to the present.</p>
<p>We use the concept of “State capacities” (both administrative and relational) to
				analyse State regulatory performance from a sociopolitical perspective. To assess
				the administrative capacities, we discuss the correspondence between the agencies’
				design and resources, and the differences between formal functions and the agencies’
				actual practices. We also examine the policies of the National Government and its
				interaction with AySA and the regulatory and control agencies to evaluate the
				relational capacities. In addition, we identify existing power resources so as to
				understand the behaviour of actors, their strategies and their influence on service
				operation. We understand the State’s power resources as a) the legal framework to
				manage the service, b) the negotiation skills with non-State actors and c) the
				political objectives of the service. Regarding the social actors, we identify a)
				their alliance capabilities and b)their cooperative or confrontational positions
				towards State agencies. The analysis is based on official documents, legislation and
				statistics, company balance sheets and reports, newspaper articles and
				semi-structured interviews.</p>
<p>This article is organised in five sections. In Section 1, we discuss the concept of
				State capacity. Section 2 focuses on the creation of AySA: the legislative debate
				and formal aspects of its design. Section 3 deals with the regulatory regimes. In
				the first part of this Section, we will present the regulatory scheme during the
				private concession. The second part will describe the new regulatory framework and
				compare it to the previous one. Section 4 will examine how State regulation
				currently works. Finally, in Section 5 we will add our concluding remarks.</p>

<a name="idp34560"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">State capacities under discussion</p>
<p>We have based the discussion of the concept of State capacity on <sup><a href="#B21">Skocpol (1989)</a></sup>. We view the State as an actor
				that designs and implements its own objectives. This “State autonomy” not only shows
				that actions taken are not simple responses to the demands of social groups or
				classes, it also leads to the study of the State’s capacity to achieve those
				actions. State capacities must be analysed in connection with specific
				socio-economic and political environments and with the interests and resources of
				social actors.</p>
<p>When structural reforms were implemented around the world, the literature began to
				focus on the importance of State regulation of markets. Scholars have argued that
				State regulation is necessary but that regulatory interventions are not always
				effective. That is why many authors have developed theoretical arguments and
				empirical studies about the nature of the State capacities needed to adequately
				fulfil regulatory responsibilities (<sup><a href="#B8">GRINDLE,
					1996</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B9">HALL, 2002</a></sup>; HILDERBRAND and
				GRINDLE, 1994; <sup><a href="#B15">MIZRAHI, 2004</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B16">OSZLAK and ORELLANA, 1991</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B22">TOBELEM, 1992</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Based on the general arguments of the above-mentioned studies, this article also
				draws from <sup><a href="#B17">Palermo (1998)</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B1">Alonso (2007)</a></sup> and <sup><a href="#B20">Repetto (2007)</a></sup>, who call attention to the need to study the
				political dimensions of State regulation in addition to considering the
				administrative capacities. In their view, the examination of actor's interests,
				resources and strategies sheds light on the actor's voices and veto power in public
				policy definitions. Political dimensions are of a relational nature and refer to the
				“specific interactions between State and social actors in certain policy networks”
					(<sup><a href="#B1">ALONSO, 2007</a></sup>, p. 13). Likewise, <sup><a href="#B17">Palermo (1998)</a></sup> points out that “[...] political
				analysis is essential for studying State capacities, because [...politics] will be
				the main support for decision and design” (<sup><a href="#B17">PALERMO,
					1998, p</a></sup>, p. 12).</p>
<p>Administrative capacities include competences and skills associated with State
				bureaucracy and its performance. Organisations require qualified staff and “a
				professional ethos that promotes a prestigious public sector career” (<sup><a href="#B1">ALONSO, 2007</a></sup>, p. 20). In addition, they include
				inter-institutional relations and coordination between technical and political
				levels. Relational capacities refer to the relationship between State agencies and
				socio-economic actors. Regarding the institutional and organisational context,
				relational analysis focuses on social actor's veto opportunities and actions by the
				State to discourage them (<sup><a href="#B1">ALONSO, 2007</a></sup>). The
				preferences, interests and power resources of social actors must also be considered
				in order to analyse the possibilities and limits of State policies. <sup><a href="#B1">Alonso (2007)</a></sup> states that “[…] the historical
				path of a particular political arena determines institutional changes. [It] not only
				illuminates pre-existing institutional arrangements but also shows how much capacity
				[each actor, including the State] has [...] to adapt, block or interact with in the
				process of setting new rules” (<sup><a href="#B1">ALONSO, 2007,
				p</a></sup>, p.33).</p>
<p>In order to study administrative capacities, Alonso’s analytical proposal includes
				the notion of “capacity gaps”. Taking into consideration other author's concepts
					(<sup><a href="#B16">OSZLAK and ORELLANA, 1991</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B17">PALERMO, 1998</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B22">TOBELEM, 1992)</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B1">Alonso (2007)</a></sup>
				classifies possible capacity gaps at two different levels: a macro-institutional
				level relative to the existence or absence of an institutional framework (formal and
				informal rules that encourage the behaviours of certain actors) and a
				micro-institutional level at which organisational capacities are considered. He
				distinguishes three kinds of capacity gaps in the macro-institutional environment
				and two in the micro.</p>
<p>We have identified the following gaps in the macro-institutional environment: 1)
				political-institutional gaps, 2) gaps in inter-agency relationships, and 3) gaps in
				public service careers. The first one refers to the institutional framework (the
				political regime, Constitution, regulatory structures, and informal rules based on
				cultural patterns) that can restrict or facilitate policy execution. An analysis of
				these capacities allows us to distinguish possible incompatibilities between
				proposed objectives and implementation. The second type of gap is linked to
				coordination failures as a result of agencies’ ambiguous or overlapping
				responsibilities. These situations lead to an inefficient use of resources and
				adversely affect policy implementation. The key to coordinating the work of agencies
				is to assess the adequacy of the legal framework (formal and informal rules) that
				rules their activities. The last type of gap is related to the difficulty in
				consolidating stable and competent administrative bodies in light of changes of
				government. The professionalization of agencies is seriously hindered by political
				discontinuity, inappropriate incentives for government officials and unrestrictive
				rules. These conditions lead to a constant turnover of technicians and
				professionals.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#B1">Alonso (2007)</a></sup> recognises two gaps in the
				micro-institutional environment: one in internal organisation and the other in
				skills and knowledge. The first category refers to the distance between formal
				organisation (organisation chart) and informal networks. A big difference between
				them can seriously affect an agency’s performance. Another aspect that must be
				analysed is the formalisation of procedures in technical manuals. Accurate manuals
				help to improve the quality of the task distribution system, the flow of information
				between different subunits and the decision-making structures (<sup><a href="#B1">ALONSO, 2007</a></sup>). The lack of adequate funding, equipment or
				physical space can seriously reduce the agency’s capacities. The second type of
				micro-institutional gap refers to deficits in information and skills (e.g.
				managerial abilities and professional competences) that tend to shape a hostile
				institutional environment (<sup><a href="#B1">ALONSO, 2007</a></sup>).</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, the analysis of the relational dimension includes the study
				of existing resources. State capacity depends on its own resources and on those of
				other actors. Thus, the analysis of available resources should be considered
				alongside the way in which actors evaluate them and therefore develop their
				strategies. In line with this, <sup><a href="#B1">Alonso (2007)</a></sup>
				classifies power resources in four types: a) structural-economic resources, which
				refer to the structural context in which actors interact; b) organisational
				resources that enable collective action; c) institutional resources–rules,
				institutions and practices that create the conditions for leverage in different
				political arenas; and d) information resources, which are related to the control of
				the flow of information.</p>
<p>To explain the logic of action and exchanges between the State and social actors,
					<sup><a href="#B1">ALONSO (2007)</a></sup> uses the concept of “policy
				network”, which refers to the implementation of previous political decisions. Policy
				network analysis not only offers insights about power configurations and
				reconfigurations, but also makes it possible to evaluate the effect these
				interactions have on the outcomes of new policies.</p>
<p>Considering these two dimensions, Section 3 will address the study of the Argentine
				State’s capacity to regulate drinking water and sanitation services in the
				Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires. Capacity gaps will be identified with particular
				emphasis on two issues. First, we will study the correspondence between the
				regulatory framework and the agencies’ resources. We will then analyse the
				concordance between formal functions and the agencies’ actual practices. The study
				of the relational dimension will take into account the National Government’s
				decisions by stressing the interaction between the State and social actors, their
				power resources and strategies. We will present the indicators selected for each
				dimension in the <a href="#t01">Methodological Annex</a>.
				Before explaining the results of this analysis, the following section will describe
				the creation of AySA.</p>

<a name="idp135776"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The creation of Argentine water and sanitation services</p>
<p>In May 1993, a 30-year concession for the drinking water and sanitation services of
				the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires was granted to private company Aguas
				Argentinas S.A. (AASA) [Argentine Waters Inc.]. The consortium was comprised by Suez
				Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez (25.4%), Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (12.6%), Meller S.A.
				(10.8%), Banco Galicia y Buenos Aires (8.1%), Compagnie Générale des Eaux S.A.
				(7.9%), Anglian Water Plc. (4.5%) and the Stock Ownership Program (10%). This
				concession became one of the largest worldwide with almost 10 million residents in
				an area of approximately 1,800 km<sup><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>.
				According to the concession contract, AASA was not only responsible for improving
				the quality, pressure and continuity of the supplies, but also for maintaining and
				extending the facilities. By the end of the concession, the company agreed to
				increase the number of residents served with drinking water by 71% and to raise
				sewage services by 96%.</p>
<p>During AASA’s management, numerous regulatory changes altered the original
				contractual clauses and authorised increases in rates that largely exceeded the
				domestic CPI for the purposes of financing investments. As these investments did not
				materialise, these new rates ultimately pushed up AASA’s profits. Between 1993 and
				2002, rates increased by 88%. The average bill was US$14.56 in May 1993, reaching
				US$27.40 in January 2002<sup><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> (during
				these years inflation was close to zero or even negative) (<sup><a href="#B7">ETOSS, 2003</a></sup>). In addition, fixed costs charged to bills made the
				pricing structure highly regressive. In May 2002, the cost of water and sanitation
				services represented 1.3% of the income of those in the highest deciles and 9% of
				the income of those in the lowest deciles.</p>
<p>Only 58% of the mandatory investment goals were met during the first five-year period
				(1993-1998) under private management. In contrast, the investments made from
				1999-2000 met 100% of the commitments specified in the contract for the first two
				years of the second five-year period (1999-2003). This occurred because planned
				adjustments in investment commitments were delayed for two years and works were
				approved ex-post. The execution level fell to 62% in 2001 and to 19% in 2002, which
				represents 37% of the promised investments for the period 2001-2002. From 1993 to
				2002, the expansion in drinking water service coverage only reached 79% of the
				population in contrast with the 88% estimated in the contract. The sewage service
				only reached 63%, when the initial estimate had been 74%. The treatment of sewer
				fluids registered the largest level of noncompliance, standing at 7%, when the
				contract had been set at 74% for 2002. Investments in infrastructure renewal fell
				short of the goal to reduce the high number of leakages. Low water pressure problems
				affected almost 70% of the water supply network (<sup><a href="#B7">ETOSS, 2003</a></sup>).</p>
<p>In contrast, AASA’s profitability showed a significant increase between 1994 and
				2001. The company’s profits amounted to a 20% return on capital. This percentage
				reveals the privileged situation in which its operations took place, as it was
				considerably superior to the 11.21% estimated in its bid and to those considered
				acceptable in the United States (6.5-12.5%), the United Kingdom (6-7%) and France
				(6%) (<sup><a href="#B18">PHILLIPS, 1993</a></sup>). In addition to these
				exceptional profits, AASA borrowed internationally, taking advantage of interest
				rate differentials between Argentine and international interest rates during most of
				the 1990s. Its large external debt was highly consequential in the following decade.
					<sup><a href="#B4">Azpiazu et al. (2005)</a></sup> have explained that
				at the beginning of 2002, the company’s debt was about US$ 650 million (almost 20
				times its net equity) with payment commitments of US$ 215 million for that year and
				of US$ 109 million for 2003.</p>
<p>Given the serious social, political and economic turmoil in late 2001, in January
				2002, provisional President Eduardo Duhalde put an end to the Convertibility regime
				and allowed the currency to depreciate<sup><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>. Likewise, the so-called Public Emergency and Exchange
				Regime Reform Act (Nº 25,561) was enacted in 2002. It mandated the “pesification” of
				several dollarized prices and prohibited indexation clauses from being included in
				Public Administration contracts. The National Government was also authorised to
				renegotiate contracts, including those of the privatised public utilities. Rates
				would not change until contracts had been fully revised.</p>
<p>The renegotiation of AASA’s contract gave the State the chance to change a number of
				policies that had preserved the company’s benefits without considering the interests
				of consumers. As we previously explained, AASA’s performance was characterised by
				its non-fulfilment of investment commitments, high profitability and a discretional
				endowment policy. Nevertheless, the company demanded large compensations from the
				Argentine government in order to maintain its original economic stability. The
				concession contract included a specific clause that would compensate the company
				should any changes in costs or other variables affect its balance sheets. To this
				end, AASA filed a petition with the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement
				of Investment Disputes (ICSID). To strengthen its position in the negotiation, the
				company counted on the support of the French government and multilateral lending
				agencies.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the renegotiation process, the rescindment of the contract was
				not an option. The National Government wanted AASA to keep the concession, but it
				would participate in the development of the service's infrastructure. On May 11,
				2004, the State and AASA signed a letter of intent that guaranteed favourable
				conditions for negotiating the final contract. Both parties were committed to making
				new investments and freezing the rates until December 2004. The National Government
				also agreed to suspend fines and AASA withdrew its petition before the ICSID. In
				this respect, the Argentine external debt negotiation was a key factor that
				explained the outcome of the agreement. As the default had to be resolved, AASA’s
				irregular service conditions were left aside. The company’s interests were preserved
				in exchange for the French government’s support at the International Monetary Fund
				Board.</p>
<p>Once the letter of intent had expired and in accordance with the debt swap in 2005,
				the renegotiation process froze. Eventually, AASA’s shareholders lost interest in
				running the company because of the new contractual conditions and unfavourable
				economic-financial results. Suez was exiting Latin America and beginning to invest
				in gas and electricity markets in China, Algeria and some countries in the Persian
				Gulf. Nevertheless, AASA’s foreign shareholders decided to sue the Argentine State
				in local courts and continued to challenge it before the ICSID. On July 30, 2010,
				the ICSID ruled in favour of the claimants (Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de
				Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.). It pointed out that the Argentine State
				had not offered “fair and equitable treatment” of the company’s investments. To
				date, the ICSID’s findings have not concluded. The amount of money Argentina will
				have to pay has yet to be determined. While the claimants have to estimate their
				losses, Argentina can request a revision or annulment of the award.</p>
<p>When negotiations with AASA to sign a new agreement failed, the government attempted
				to find new investors to replace Suez. But the company’s large external debt and the
				freeze on rates imposed by the government in 2002 discouraged potential investors.
				Thus, in 2006, the government rescinded the concession contract (Decree Nº 303/06,
				March 2006). Rather than admitting that negotiations had collapsed, the National
				Government justified the annulment claiming excessively high nitrate levels and
				insufficient coverage that affected consumer rights and health. In fact, sanitary
				risks related to excessive nitrate levels and insufficient coverage already existed
				when the letter of intent was signed in May 2004, but these claims were only
				considered cause for rescission because there was no alternative but to keep the
				company running.</p>
<p>Decree No. 304/06 and Law No. 26,100, formally created AySA, a State-owned public
				limited company (90% of the shares belong to the State – non-transferable capital –
				and 10% to the employees through a Stock Ownership Program). The partnership would
				last for 99 years and this period could be reduced or extended at a special
				shareholder meeting. AySA kept AASA’s organisational structure, as well as all of
				its assets and workers. Its working plan and budget fell under the supervision of
				the Ministerio de Planificación Federal, Inversión Pública y Servicios (MPFIPyS)
				[Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Utilities].</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="idp162320"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The water supply and sanitation services regulatory regimes</p>
<p>Even though the main purpose of this Section is to study the regulatory framework
				created in February 2007 (Law Nº 26,221), we will also describe the scheme in
				existence during the concession period for the purposes of comparison. This analysis
				will be presented in the first part of the Section, with the second part devoted to
				the new regime in detail.</p>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp164416"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">State regulation during the private concession</p>
<p>From 1993 to 2007, service regulation and control functions were carried out by
					the Ente Tripartito de Obras y Servicios Sanitarios (ETOSS) [Tripartite Water
					Sanitation Agency]. Its creation by decree rather than law reduced its
					legitimacy and independence, the latter having been especially affected by the
					way in which its authorities were appointed. As the government could appoint the
					members of the board, the agency was subject to political pressure. Furthermore,
					members could sit on the board for six years with the possibility of one
					re-election and without any legal restrictions regarding a previous or later job
					in the concessionaire company. This last aspect created the conditions for
					pro-company behaviour. In addition, as part of ETOSS’s financial resources were
					derived from a percentage of the rates, ETOSS had no incentive to force the
					company to reduce them. Finally, the risk of capture was extremely high because
					it had to monitor a single company with no competition whatsoever. Because of
					this weak design, a political and institutional capacity gap was evident.</p>
<p>Regarding some aspects of the implementation of this framework, we can point out
					that ETOSS had serious difficulties imposing sanctions and coordinating its
					action with that of the political levels of government. The Secretaría de
					Recursos Naturales y Desarrollo Sustentable (SRNyDS) [Natural Resources and
					Sustainable Development Department], subordinated to the National Government,
					regularly interfered with its functions. Although drinking water and sanitation
					services continued to be a monopoly, regulation was extremely lax. Regulatory
					flaws cannot be explained in terms of the agency’s design problems. Rather,
					ETOSS’s performance was mainly affected by the joint capture of AASA and the
					National Government through the SRNyDS. This department assumed ETOSS’s
					regulatory function from 1998 to 1999. In most cases, the SRNyDS lifted
					penalties that had been imposed by ETOSS for political reasons, without taking
					into account the technical reasons for the fines. The SRNyDS not only became
					responsible for the rate policy and work plans, but also for the appointment of
					the national members on ETOSS’s board.</p>
<p>In addition, AASA also benefitted from constant changes to the contract. 15
					months after the beginning of the concession and in spite of the fact that rate
					increases had been forbidden in the first 10 years in the contract, ETOSS
					authorised an increase to guarantee investment goals were achieved. This
					adjustment demonstrated how opportunistic AASA’s offer in the bidding process
					had actually been. In February 1997, the National Government established a new
					contract change that excluded ETOSS by decree. The result of this revision was
					merely implied in a new contract. Among other changes, there stand out: 1) the
					incorporation of an exchange rate insurance that eliminated the risk of monetary
					devaluation for AASA; 2) the replacement of the infrastructure tax by two other
					taxes (a fixed indexable payment that included an environmental aspect not
					present in the original contract, and the other tax to be paid by new users); 3)
					a change in the threshold for cost adjustments (from 7% to 0.5%); 4) the
					incorporation of an annual special rate revision; and, 5) the delay or
					cancellation of investment requirements and fines. In July 1999, the SRNyDS
					introduced new changes in rate regulations and a penalty regime, which also
					benefitted the company. Fines were reduced and ETOSS’s control capacities
					weakened. Later, in January 2001, AASA and ETOSS signed an agreement act that
					approved the second quinquennial plan and a 10.5% rate increase.</p>
<p>With regard to internal organisation capacity gaps, there was high turnover among
					ETOSS’s top managers. Until 2005, managers remained in their positions, on
					average, for only half of their terms (three years). Such instability, which
					interfered with their professionalism, was linked to the influence political
					authorities exercised on the appointment of board members. Lastly, skills and
					knowledge gaps also affected its regulatory functions. Even though the contract
					renegotiation of July 1999 introduced new regulatory tools (a new formula to
					calculate rates, regulatory accounting, benchmarking, among others) to improve
					regulation and control over the company, they were not put into practice. AASA
					repeatedly refused to release information in that regard, with the National
					Government’s consent.</p>
<p>During the post-Convertibility renegotiation process, the ETOSS made important
					advances to overcome this gap. Many of these regulatory instruments were
					enforced, which allowed it to carry out a detailed follow-up of AASA. The
					ETOSS’s role was limited to advising the Renegotiation Committee but it was
					excluded from the design of the negotiation strategies. In contrast with the
					previous period (1993-2001), only then was its performance influenced by the
					National Government. As AASA changed its position in the renegotiation and
					decided to leave the country, the concurrence between the government and the
					company’s interests came to an end. The situation of regulatory capture became
					evident when the National Government decided to rescind the concession contract
					(March 2006). The regulatory agency did not intervene in the drafting of the
					decree that cancelled it. Furthermore, it had to repeal its own ruling that to
					some extent contradicted the National Government’s arguments to rescind the
					contract (excessive nitrate levels in the water). Only six months earlier, in
					Resolution Nº 95/05, the ETOSS had recognised a decline in nitrate levels and
					reduced AASA’s penalties. It did not participate in the establishment of a
					regulatory scheme for the renationalised services, either.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp176720"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The new regulatory framework for AySA</p>
<p>The new regulatory framework of 2007 ratified the State’s responsibility for the
					supply, maintenance and expansion of the service. It also recognised access to
					water as a human right and established efficiency and equity principles as
					complementary aims. In addition to previous regulatory objectives, it set new
					goals – efficient delivery, fair and reasonable rates, and awareness of water
					conservation, among others.</p>
<p>Although the regulatory framework was established by law and not by decree,
					legislative participation and debates were limited. The National Government
					succeeded in its strategy to obtain urgent congressional approval of the bill.
					By the end of December 2006, the bill was approved in the Senate with 32
					affirmative votes and 13 negative ones. In February 2007, after a brief
					discussion, the Lower Chamber passed it with 133 affirmative votes and 75
					negative votes.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure N° 1, there are three areas in this new regulatory design: 1)
					a policy and supervision area, 2) a control area and 3) an audit area. The first
					one is composed of the MPFIPyS, the Secretaría de Obras Públicas (SOP)
					[Department of Public Works], and the Subsecretaría de Recursos Hídricos (SSRH)
					[Sub-department of Water Resources]. The control area comprises the Ente
					Regulador de Agua y Saneamiento (ERAS) [Water Services Agency] and the Agencia
					de Planificación (APLA) [Planning Agency]. The audit area includes a Supervisory
					Committee, composed of two representatives of the Sindicatura General de la
					Nación (SIGEN) [National Controller General Office] and one member of the
					Sindicato Gran Buenos Aires de Trabajadores de Obras Sanitarias (SGBATOS) [Water
					Trade Union]. The Auditoría General de la Nación (AGN) [National General Audit
					Office] and a group of auditors are both in charge of the external audit<sup><a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a></sup>.</p>

Regulatory design of Argentina Water and Sanitation </span></p>
</div>
				</p>
<p>Regarding the competence of the authorities, the MPFIPyS is responsible (through
					the SOP) for the creation of regulations (regulatory framework, concession
					contract, among others) and the approval of action plans and company budgets.
					The SSRH, acting as the implementation authority, is in charge of service policy
					execution and of regulation and control. Among other tasks, it has to: a) comply
					with and enforce the regulatory framework and the concession contract, b) set
					rates, c) approve AySA’s plans, d) oversee the company’s annual reports, and e)
					verify rate revisions and action plan adjustments.</p>
<p>The political and institutional capacity gap identified in the ETOSS persists in
					the new regulatory agency. Even though the ERAS was established as an autarkic
					organisation, its independence is limited by the MPFIPyS. As previously
					mentioned, the SSRH has the authority to set rates and expansion goals and to
					impose sanctions on the company for not meeting its performance standards.
					Unlike the ETOSS, the ERAS only has control functions. It is in charge of
					service quality control, regulatory accounting, benchmarking implementation and
					can only impose sanctions on managers.</p>
<p>Although the ERAS’s board has a tripartite composition, the number of
					representatives on its board has fallen from two to one per jurisdiction. The
					terms of these representatives have been reduced from six to four years, but the
					possibility of re-election for one extra term has not been eliminated. As board
					members are appointed by the National Government (two of them require the
					recommendation of the governments of Buenos Aires City and of Buenos Aires
					province, respectively), the ERAS’s management could be swayed by the specific
					political commitments of its managers. In addition, the president of the board
					holds a permanent position. From a strictly institutional point of view, this
					change implies more dependence on National Government decisions. Yet, from a
					political perspective, it guarantees the president’s affinity with the National
					Government’s policies.</p>
<p>Regarding user participation, the competencies of the User Auditing Committee
					were just as restricted as those of the previous User Commission. Not only was
					it created in the sphere of the ERAS, but its recommendations and opinions were
					not binding. The new framework also set up four types of controls over the ERAS:
					a) auditing control in charge of the SIGEN; b) anti-corruption control, under
					the responsibility of the Anti-corruption Office; c) user defence, exercised by
					the Ombudsman; and d) management and patrimonial control headed by the AGN.
					Finally, its main funds were derived from a percentage (2.67%) of the rate, as
					was the case of the ETOSS.</p>
<p>The APLA’s role consisted of coordinating the expansion and improvement of the
					service. This included the development and control of projects, plans and
					environmental impact studies. This new agency also had to establish quality
					goals, approve applications for expansion and provide or facilitate public
					access to service information. Like the ERAS, it was an independent and
					self-financing agency but the fact that its board was presided over by the SSRH
					Undersecretary undermined its independence. The two other board members were
					nominated by the Governments of Buenos Aires City and Buenos Aires Province and
					were elected by the National Government. With the exception of the president,
					board members were appointed for a four-year period with the possibility of
					re-election for one additional term.</p>
<p>Resources to cover the APLA’s operating costs largely originated from a
					percentage of its rates and had to be shared with the ERAS. Management and
					patrimonial control also fell under the responsibility of the SIGEN and the AGN.
					Unlike the ERAS, there was no formal opportunity for users to participate. They
					were indirectly represented by municipal authorities, who participated in an
					Advisory Commission.</p>
<p>This formal regime of multiple authorities presented a regulatory fragmentation
					problem, which arose from an inter-agency gap. Some functions between government
					bodies and control agencies overlapped, in practice reducing the ERAS’s and
					APLA’s competencies. In addition, the new regulatory design tended to centralise
					decisions in the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and
					Utilities.</p>

<a name="idp196544"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Service quality and coverage</p>
<p>AySA provided services to Buenos Aires City and 17 districts of Buenos Aires
					Province. The company’s activities included collection and purification of raw
					water; transport, distribution and commercialisation of safe drinking water;
					collection, transport, treatment, and disposal and commercialisation of sewage,
					including drainage of industrial waste. The supply had to comply with standards
					of continuity, regularity, quality and universality.</p>
<p>As in the previous scheme, proper service standards (coverage and quality) were
					established in the contract under the title “binding instrument” (Resolution Nº
					170/10) and in the regulatory framework. In the event of quality failure, AySA
					had to report to the ERAS immediately and implement the necessary actions to
					restore the required standards. If unplanned service interruptions occurred, the
					supply had to be restored as soon as possible. Planned cuts had to be notified
					if the interruption extended for longer than expected and emergency supplies had
					to be announced to the affected users. Unlike what happened under private
					management, AySA had no obligation to provide a minimum level of water pressure.
					With regard to sewage effluent treatment and quality, AySA had to respect SSRH
					standards. Unlike AASA, if there was a delay in service payment, the new company
					could not cut off services to residential and public users.</p>
<p>To guarantee performance of the services, the new framework mandated the
					implementation of the Improvement, Operation, Expansion and Maintenance Plans.
					As with AASA, these plans were to be reviewed and evaluated every five years by
					the MPFIPyS. Similarly, a fiduciary fund was created to finance the expansion of
					infrastructure. If AySA did not keep to these plans, neither sanctions nor
					contract cancellation would be applied. Rather, AySA would have to work to
					restore the execution of the plan. As for the sanction regime, two types of
					penalties were in effect: 1) penalties related to company actions and 2)
					penalties regarding the performance of the company’s top officers. If delivery
					was interrupted, the SSRH would oblige the company to restore coverage. If the
					managers did not abide by their obligations, the ERAS was entitled to issue
					warnings. The SSRH could suspend the managers, while the National Government had
					the authority to fire them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp202880"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The rates and economic regime of the water and sanitation services</p>
<p>Regarding the economic regime, at least one annual review had to be carried out
					in order to review and eventually adjust expansion plans. If an out of the
					ordinary situation affected company finances, AySA could request SSRH
					intervention to minimise the negative impact.</p>
<p>Two rate regimes existed: a flat rate and a metered rate. The cadastral system
					included a bi-monthly basic rate (BBR) composed of a discount coefficient “K”, a
					zonal coefficient “Z”, a general rate for services “TG”, a covered built-up area
					coefficient “SC”, and a quality factor of the building “E” added to one-tenth of
					the total surface of the ground “ST”. At the same time, the BBR had a default
					base value according to the type of user (bi-monthly minimum basic rate) [BBR=
					K*Z*TG*(SC*E+ST/10); BBR minimum] (<sup><a href="#B3">AZPIAZU and
						FORCINITO, 2004</a></sup>). In addition to the value-added tax (VAT), 2.67% was
					added to this minimum rate to finance control agencies. Metered rates combined
					the physical size of the building with actual consumption. The rate of the
					volume of consumed water was added to the bi-monthly minimum charge.</p>
<p>While both regimes had to guarantee universal service and address health and
					social objectives, no provisions encouraged a rational use of water or a more
					equitable rate. Only a social rate programme had been implemented for vulnerable
					populations. The rates kept the same structure as the one existing under private
					management, including fixed charges, which made them highly regressive. By 2009,
					these charges represented 19% of AySA’s<em> revenues</em>. Although the
					service was renationalised, the rates remained frozen from the beginning of the
					renegotiation process in 2002. This situation meant that by December 2010 AySA’s
					revenues covered only 49% of its expenses. The rest of its expenditures were
					financed by State transfers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp210112"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Regulating and controlling information</p>
<p>Information about quality, operation and maintenance had to be available to the
					SSRH and control agencies. AySA was obliged to publish four types of reports: 1)
					a report on service standards, 2) an annual report, 3) periodic reports and 4)
					additional reports. Its report on service standards had to state the objectives
					that the company had achieved and the activities pursued in each area. The
					annual report was to be submitted to the SSRH and assessed by external auditors.
					It had to present the company’s results (investments, costs and expenses,
					operations, among others) and not only contained data about its financial
					situation but also provided information about its actions for the following two
					years. There were two kinds of periodic reports: a) a monthly technical report
					on service standards in which production, work execution, and service standard
					indicators were set; and b) a semi-annual report in which concession revenues
					and expenditures were reported. Finally, additional reports containing specific
					information had to be submitted upon request by the SSRH and control
					agencies.</p>
<p>The new framework also stipulated that the SSRH, APLA and ERAS had free access to
					AySA’s accounting, economic, financial, commercial and contractual information.
					These agencies and the company had to produce a regulatory accounting system to
					monitor the financial aspects of the concession. AySA was also obliged to
					provide sufficient data for benchmarking studies.</p>
<p>In short, the way the new regulatory framework was created was evidence of the
					absence of a broad debate about the best design for the service. Contrary to
					accepted criteria, this fragmented scheme ultimately concentrated the functions
					in the MPFIPyS and left the newly created agencies without much real power to
					carry out their limited roles. In some cases, the existing regulatory mechanisms
					conserved or even deepened the irregularities arising during the private
					management period. The following section will focus on these regulatory
					flaws.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp216304"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Regulation and control: how does it work?</p>
<p>Following the renationalisation of the supplies, the implementation of the new
				regulatory framework did not produce significant changes in the existing regulatory
				regime. It is paradoxical that the ERAS was named regulator even though it only
				exercised control functions. In addition, we can identify an internal organisation
				gap. As the creation of the two agencies (the ERAS and the APLA) did not provide
				enough financing for their activities, their performances deteriorated. To cover
				their budget deficit, both agencies had to appeal to MPFIPyS for contributions,
				which in some cases were submitted through AySA. In 2008, AySA gave the ERAS and the
				APLA advances of US$ 4,584,030 and US$ 3,319,470, respectively (<sup><a href="#B2">AGN, 2009</a></sup>)<sup><a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to these budget problems, other gaps in the organisational structure
				existed. The ERAS officers interviewed for this study stated that staff cuts had
				been put into practice. From 2003, the agency was seriously affected by the
				reduction of its staff and the disbanding of its technical teams. A comparison
				between the ERAS and the APLA staff and the ETOSS agents revealed a reduction of
				about 20%. Unlike the ETOSS performance – which was not optimal – the ERAS operation
				showed a lack of coordination between political and technical areas. To a certain
				extent, these differences may have been linked to the unionisation of the technical
				staff that joined the SGBATOS and the consequent improvement in their working
				conditions. Moreover, as the ERAS managers worked independently from each other, the
				scope and depth of their studies were undermined.</p>
<p>In addition, some of the interviewees said that political rather than technical
				considerations had been at stake in the creation of the two new agencies. The main
				reason to divide them was to create a balance of power between the ERAS president
				and the SSRH Undersecretary in charge of the APLA. As a result of this tension, the
				working climate was seriously affected. Some of the ERAS officers argued that they
				had no knowledge of the APLA’s activities because, in practice, expansion plans were
				set by the company.</p>
<p>Regarding skills and knowledge gaps, the scarce information submitted by the company
				limited the ERAS’s control. The agency had formally received AySA’s annual budgets
				from 2008 but it had been unable to make any recommendations. Its participation had
				become a mere formality because AySA’s budget depended on prior congressional
				approval. The company did not submit its financial information to the ERAS but it
				did send it to the MPFIPyS. Interestingly, this information was forwarded to the
				ERAS by the Ministry, which lacked the technical capacity to analyse it.</p>
<p>User participation (User Auditing Committee) was still subordinated to the ERAS. As
				mentioned above, user associations were formally excluded from participating in
				plans to expand coverage at the APLA so their demands and proposals were voiced, in
				some cases, by municipal mayors, who represented them at the agency. According to
				the statement made by some representatives of user associations, the Auditing
				Committee was not working because it had no funds. In the new regulatory scheme, the
				ERAS was not obliged to finance the Auditing Committee’s activities. However, they
				pointed out that AySA had interceded with the MPFIPyS authorities to restore
				resources from the SSRH and not from the ERAS. They also stated that associations
				were holding regular meetings with AySA’s board and estimated that this bond would
				grow stronger.</p>
<p>In short, the new framework had produced a fragmented regulatory regime with a
				centralised political decision structure. There was a political-institutional gap in
				both agencies. Even though they had been created by law, their performance was
				extensively influenced by the National Government. As pointed out earlier, the
				members of their boards were appointed by the National Executive and the presidents
				were connected to the National Government authorities. In this sense, an
				inter-agency relations gap also existed. The SSRH’s role questioned the agencies’
				relevance and independence. As the Undersecretary was also the APLA president, the
				APLA was less autonomous than would be expected of an autarchic and decentralised
				agency. In addition, the ERAS’s competence was reduced to control functions because
				regulatory competences were conferred to the SSRH.</p>
<p>As we explained, many of the internal organisation and information gaps of the period
				under private management persisted and, in some cases, increased. Budget deficits,
				staff reductions, conflicts of interest among the authorities and the lack of
				coordination between managerial, technical and political areas seriously affected
				the working climate and the dynamic of both agencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp231968"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Final comments</p>
<p>Considering the notion of State capacity, this case shows more continuities than
				ruptures in the regulatory performance of the Argentine State between 1993 and 2011.
				The deficiencies of the regulatory framework and significant regulatory capacity
				gaps explain the absence of a clear regulatory strategy. Managerial changes were not
				accompanied by the necessary redefinition of regulatory parameters. Predictably,
				regulatory design and implementation problems existing under private management
				acquired new significance after the renationalisation. The logic behind the new
				regulatory framework is unclear. Service management and regulatory competences were
				centralised in the hands of the MPFIPyS, suggesting a regulatory scheme based on
				political control. At the same time, two decentralised control agencies with several
				design and performance limitations were created. Assuming that these agencies were
				created for reasons of mere formality, and taking into account that a centralised
				regulatory regime makes them unnecessary, questions arise about the nature of a
				regulatory regime that calls for such a formality. Underlying this institutional
				framework, problems may arise regarding service sustainability. Beyond this
				particular case, it will be necessary to re-discuss, from a political and an
				academic perspective, the nature, limitations and scope of State regulation and
				control of services under public ownership. It is clear that old recipes or their
				readjustment to the new conditions are not as effective as what is required. The
				definition and implementation of different concepts in this matter are fundamental
				to ensure better performance by these companies.</p>
<p>When comparing the two administrations, we found a substantial difference in the way
				the services were operated. In the case of AASA, the main purpose of the company was
				to obtain high profitability at the expense of the quality and improvement of the
				supplies. By contrast, AySA’s management showed a great commitment to service
				development. This firm expanded infrastructure investments (which grew by 384% from
				2007 to 2009) with State transfers. Although these transfers are somewhat necessary
				to recover the supplies, AySA’s dependence on them must gradually be reduced in
				order to avoid operational difficulties. In fact, AySA’s own current revenues do not
				cover half of its current expenses. Hence, as rates have been frozen since 2002, it
				will be necessary to find the best way to readjust them without neglecting the
				protection of the most vulnerable sectors of the population. Regarding the rate
				regime and structure, a more equitable access to the services must be guaranteed. On
				one hand, the rate structure must be revised in order to reduce its highly
				regressive effect. On the other, the rate regime must promote a rational use of the
				resource by implementing micro-measuring devices, along with other criteria,
				considering the payment capacity of users. As access to water and sanitation is
				recognised as a human right, the existing institutional architecture of supply,
				regulation and control should be reshaped to fully guarantee the quality and
				expansion of the supply in future.</p>

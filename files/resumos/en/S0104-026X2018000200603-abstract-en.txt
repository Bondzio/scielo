Abstract: The present text aims to understand how the spaces of instruction and reading existing in the old Goian capital (Goiás), in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, were (re) appropriated by some women in order to guarantee to them the expression of their experiences. In order to do so, starting from the documentation of the Goyano Literary Cabinet, created in 1864, we sought, through the protagonism of Silvina Ermelinda Xavier de Britto and Jacintha Luiza do Couto Brandão Peixoto, to understand the issues about the education of women, their exercise of reading, an essay on emancipation, represented by the calls for vote from Goiás&#8217; women in 1889 and the tactics handleb by these women in the expectation of exercising their intellectuality, although presented to them as a path full of obstructions.

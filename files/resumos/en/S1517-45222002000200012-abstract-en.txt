The article presents an explanation-description of the rise in juvenile violence associated to misdemeanor and aspects of the degrading-exclusion of forms of social survival. The argument feeds on anthropological elements of lives of youngsters socially excluded and culturally included in a market economy, thus characterized by distinct forms of consumptions, whether material or symbolic. Therefore, the phenomenon of juvenile violence cannot be reduced to a judicial-penal scheme, incapable of solving the social problematics as it emerges in the last years of the 20th century and in these first years of the 21st century.

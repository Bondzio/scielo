This study examines the implementation and the main results achieved in Mexico by the Ford Foundation International Fellowships Program - IFP. This article refers to the historical moment and the political context in which the program was developed and presents an overview of the marginalization conditions affecting indigenous peoples, emphasizing their low rates of access to higher education. A number of indicators relating to the academic performance of fellows who completed their postgraduate studies are presented and the factors which affect the positive results achieved are discussed. Throughout the paper it is shown that unconventional scholarship programs such as the IFP contribute to cope with access, staying in school and graduation issues that affect the indigenous population in the higher education system in Mexico.

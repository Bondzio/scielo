ABSTRACT This article analyzes how Bogotá&#8217;s transport programs TransMilenio BRT and Ciclovía were learned and adopted in Guadalajara, Mexico. It proposes that the construction and mobilization of simplified &#8220;narratives of progress&#8221; and the persuasive capacities of the actors that tell these stories, what I here call &#8220;persuasive practitioners&#8221;, are largely influential in driving policy learning and adoption of other cities&#8217; policies.

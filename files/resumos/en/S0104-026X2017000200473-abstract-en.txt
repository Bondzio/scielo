Abstract: In this article, we discuss about the so-called gender identities, given the complexity and the emergence of the issue, especially in recent times. The purpose is to explore discursive ambiguity in Case in which it identifies a transvestite, resident in the city of Barra do Gar√ßas/ MT that in the perception of speech itself, let estrangement brands of the body. In our opinion, such marks lead to a deconstruction of their identities, in a performative movement and contradictory in which dresses as a man, even lying in a male body, did not recognize. By making use of his sexual organ of birth, is in the development of coping strategies. The basis of the analyzes are theories of gender and queer, deconstruction proposals of sexuality meanings.

Abstract This article aims to discuss the notion of individuality proposed by Georg Simmel and Norbert Elias, analyzing their contributions to develop a contemporary theoretical perspective, which places the individual at the center of the sociological analysis. Therefore, the article presents epistemological conceptions from both authors, who intend to develop an alternative idea to the dichotomy between individual and society, from a relational perspective of the social. Subsequently it is possible to present their conceptions of individuality, in order to highlight their similarities and possible differences. Finally, the purpose of this article is to discuss how Bernard Lahire and Jean-Claude Kaufmann retrieve insights from the classic authors to think through individualization in contemporary societies.

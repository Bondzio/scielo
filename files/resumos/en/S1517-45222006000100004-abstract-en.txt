ABSTRACT This works starts by showing the limitations of disciplinary substantive discourses. Then it presents the complexity of the concepts of reality, present, and utopia, in order to discuss how production of scientific knowledge takes place, but warning the reader about its limits in face of the complexity of the real. Given the unpredictable contingencies that always emerge in that process, the categories of Hope and utopia are presented in order to finally put forward appropriation of knowledge as scientific knowledge through disciplinary articulation that guarantees the appropriation of the real as a totality.

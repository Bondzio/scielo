This article aims at mapping and describing some practices related to the production                of performativity of the female which mimics ways to speak, understand and experience                the bodies from the circulation of images on the internet, on pages of the Universal                Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG) that aimed women. What I want to achieve,                analyzing the interaction, is to think about the role that media and the internet                technologies have in the formation of those perfomativities, whether by language of                gendering of men and women or by technologies of power that shape actors' subjection                and subjectivation.

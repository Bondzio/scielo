The research was carried out in the Northeast of Brazil (Brazilian states of Bahia, Alagoas, Sergipe and Pernambuco) using quantitative and qualitative approaches. The main results indicated weak domestication of mangaba trees to attend to an increasing market demand, and threats to extractivism by external factors.

Abstract: This paper debates the relations established among women that use public health services and mediating agents in the city of Natal for obtaining and taking abortive medicines (Misoprostol/ CytotecÂ®). The analysis lies on abortion itineraries treaded by women in an attempt to obtain the medication necessary for carrying out clandestine abortion, as well as the sorts of relations they establish with other agents involved in that network, by considering factors like risk, illegality and little material resources. The results present the following points: 1. Search for specific agents, with itineraries being conditioned by the acquaintance with people who can reach the desired product; 2. Final procedures combined with posterior attendance in public hospitals to cleanse the uterus; 3. Men&#8217;s participation in the abortion process; 4. Paradoxes of perception about the practice of abortion, with a clear perception of a generational group among health professionals; 5. Ultrasound and social network sites as integrated parts of abortion itineraries.

Abstract This paper aims to discuss texts available on the internet favorable to intimate embellishment procedures, associated more to the arguments about self esteem and health of women and less about vanity. There is a direct relationship between women&#8217;s health and embellishment of the intimate region/appearance of the genitalia, but also it is said that the surgery did not occur to correct only the aesthetics/appearance of the intimate region, which initially were surgeries to correct functional problems. In this context, the modern woman would be one that takes advantage of new technologies to their advantage, however, there are many controversies, classifications and meaning simplicated. If the vagina has been the subject of beauty dictatorship as much as other parts of the female body, and if it is possible to manufacture it, we can think of it as post-organic vagina. Here&#8217;s the argument that guides this article, operating concepts referring to body, gender, sexuality, beauty and health.

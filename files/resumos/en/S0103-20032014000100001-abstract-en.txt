The article is about the women's work in the extractivism of mangaba from the autonomy point of view. A case study was conducted in the Espírito Santo community in the county of Maracanã, in Pará State. Main methodological procedures were observation and open and semi-structured interviews. Three key aspects are analyzed: the organization of women's work (at home and in the field), the arrangements for processing and sale, and the benefits of the income generated by extractivism. The results show that most women (66%) believe that they have autonomy in the way they organize their work and the use of income from the sale of fruits, which contradicts academic research on family farm in which women's work is generally subordinate to men.

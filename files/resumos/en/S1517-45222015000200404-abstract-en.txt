Here we present the work of the French sociologist Laurent Mucchielli, L'Invention de la violence: des peurs, des chiffres, des faits(2011), which examines public and academic debate on insecurity and violence in France. The book is divided into the historical reconstruction of representations about the increase in violence and the critique of political use of crime statistics, focusing on the analysis of the intersection between "juvenile delinquency" and "immigration" as social problems. The author examines changes in behavior norms, processes of urban segregation and the construction of new mechanisms of state action in the area of public security. Instead of given solutions, the author invites to a critical inquiry into the last decades transformations and offers a clear synthesis of scientific knowledge in the area.

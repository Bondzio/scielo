In thirty years, the "pragmatic sociology" (also called "sociology of proofs") produced empirical investigations relating to every area of social life. According to the theoretical postulates they advocated, the researchers identified with this sociological school have developed quite new ways to conduct research, collect data, explore the fields, reflect on each case and drawn on controversies and affairs for making their way into the social order and the complex issue of its reproduction. The objective of this article is to present a ten points characterization of the pragmatic style in sociology and its methodological requirements and practical consequences in the research work.

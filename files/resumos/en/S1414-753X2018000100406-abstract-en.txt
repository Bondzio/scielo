Abstract The paper analyses the relationship between sustainable development and health conditions in hazardous areas. Therefore, we conducted a survey in Bissau, capital of Guinea-Bissau, Africa. The main methodological procedures were the Disease Occurrence Index (DOI), Access Index Health Services (AIHS) and Sanitation Index (SI), which allowed the quantitative analysis of the relationship between health and sanitation with regard to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The main results showed that the targets of Goal 3 - Sustainable Development, Health and Welfare - are threatened due to lack of sanitation infrastructure, low education and low income. In hazardous areas, as studied in the article, health demands permeate several SDG.

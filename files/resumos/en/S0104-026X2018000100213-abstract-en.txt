Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the perceptions of Brazilian military police forces regarding the woman&#8217;s place in these corporations. To achieve this aim, we scrutinized the data gathered through a survey answered by 5,741 military police officers, from both sexes, in February 2015. We paid special attention to the visions that those professionals have regarding the service that they have to deliver, since it is interpreted as masculine in essence. The results indicate that the symbolic obstacles towards gender equality are more than visible in the police routine.

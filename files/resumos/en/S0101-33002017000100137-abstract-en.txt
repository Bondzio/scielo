ABSTRACT Brexit and the election of Donald Trump are a symptom of the political crisis of globalization and neoliberalism. The secret of capitalism was in entrepreneurs who combined economic liberalism and individualism with nationalism and national solidarity around the domestic market. With multinational corporations, entrepreneurs have been replaced by rentiers, whose incomes do not derive from the domestic market, but from abroad, and national solidarity has been broken.

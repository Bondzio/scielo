In this present work, we aimed at analyzing the discourses on sexual and reproductive health of women who join the Solidary Movement Association Beehive, in order to understand to what extent these women have been focused by the discourses of education in health, more specifically, the policies and campaigns towards female bodies. To do so, we analyzed the women's narratives produced along the meetings of the course Women and Citizenship. In this study, we problematized how such discourses inscribe different signs in the bodies, teaching habits, values, beliefs, ways of perceiving, being and acting as women as well as thinking and acting towards their bodies. In this sense, we established connections with the cultural and gender studies in its post-structuralist verges, and with some propositions of Michel Foucault.

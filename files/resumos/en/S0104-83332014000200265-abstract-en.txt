By means of a survey of male and female judges in the state of S&#227;o Paulo, this article reveals that, despite purportedly egalitarian discourse, the judicial profession is marked by gender differences and inequalities. Here, we make interconnections between gender, profession and space. Furthermore, we describe how the building of the careers of the surveyed subjects depends upon individual ability for mobility and spatial dislocation across the state.

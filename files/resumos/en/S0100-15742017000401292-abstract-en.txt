ABSTRACT This study analyzes the Affirmative Action policy implemented in the graduate program in social anthropology at the Museu Nacional of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The goal is to contribute to the literature and to analyze the development and implementation of affirmative actions for graduate studies from a critical perspective. This study highlights the importance of joint participation of students and faculty in preparing and discussing the proposal, as well as the fact that they have taken into consideration the barriers faced by black and indigenous peoples entering into the graduate programs, and the role of the traditional selection process on maintaining these obstacles. However, the programs should not only create mechanisms for the admission of these groups into graduate programs, but it is also essential to develop policies for retention

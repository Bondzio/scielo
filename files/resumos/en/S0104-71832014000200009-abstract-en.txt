In this paper I explore the spaces and relationships created by the implementation of "laws of national unity and reconciliation". In deals with one of the official investigative procedures carried out by the Public Prosecution Authority during the implementation of Colombia's Ley 975 del 2005 (the legal framework charged with facilitating the demobilization of members of the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC), also known, simply, as paramilitaries). This paper is the product of my involvement as an observer of a group of investigators' during a process that, together with former members of paramilitary groups, sought to "reconstruct" the "historical memory" of a number of massacres that the Autodefensas Campesinas del Meta y Vichada has carried out a decade ago. The paper explores a number of mediations and translations that were part of the process (narrative, visual, cartographical and testimonial) as a way to show the complexities in "localizing" collective pain, harm and injury.

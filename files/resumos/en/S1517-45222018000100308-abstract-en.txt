Abstract This essay addresses the relationship between scientific knowledge and truth, drawing on Michel Foucault&#8217;s theoretical contribution. It untangles the analytics of the truth, by going through the path taken by Western thought in search of truth. Based on a Foucauldian perspective, the article shows how Western knowledge is constituted as truth and, therefore, as scientific knowledge. In conclusion, it delves into human possibilities to long for truth.

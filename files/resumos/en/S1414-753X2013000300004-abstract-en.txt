This study focuses on environmental and socioeconomic impacts of natural disasters, and factors that contribute to reduce damage and victims in affected communities. Reflections were carried out - based on quali-quantitative approach - entailing environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability as well their relationships with disasters paradigm (Hazard-Risk-Vulnerability-Resilience) to identify key variables in the reduction of vulnerability and for prevention and mitigation of natural disasters. The results stress that social capital, which is constrained by social e economic structures, exerts a significant influence as reducing factor of vulnerability of affected communities.

This article presents the credit agreements granted by the National Bank for Economic and Social Development between 2004 and 2015, aimed to support the export of engineering services to countries in South America, broken down by company, country, work performed and contract value. The data analysis is accompanied by the history of institutional changes experienced by the Bank in recent decades. The conclusion is that the granting of credit to Brazilian construction companies to carry out works abroad is the result of a broad movement that includes synchrony requirements between the capital value processes and the regulation mode facing the big changes that capitalism suffered in recent times; governmental actions guided by the decision to strengthen South-South relations, particularly in the countries of the southern portion of the American continent; and business strategies aimed at expanding the areas of action.

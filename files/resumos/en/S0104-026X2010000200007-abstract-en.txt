The increase in women's imprisonment has pushed authorities to confine them in male prisons. The study of the research undertaken at the 5th Penitentiary Region of Rio Grande do Sul discusses the prison dynamics, showing that the access to areas in common, the task distribution, the punishments and the definition of disciplinary rules are based on male directions. Under these circumstances, the power turns to women aiming at conditioning their practices to sexualization directed to virility, affirming, at the same time, the male behaviors. The characteristics of the female condition in such environments lead to the definition of those prisons as "manly mixed".

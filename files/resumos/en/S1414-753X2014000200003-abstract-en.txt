This paper intends to evaluate the feasibility of implementing wastewater reuse as a mitigating factor of the effects of periodical droughts in Bahia's Semi-Arid Region, considering small farmers and policy formulators views on f this practice. The research site was a small municipality of Bahia's semi-arid, SÃ£o Domingos. The methodology consisted of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. The obtained results partially confirmed the initial hypothesis, indicating that cultural based perceptions are an important factor: being either the spontaneous repulsive response or the belief that this practice poses a health risk. But the results also point these as obstacles that can be conquered. The research indicated that Economic factors were the most difficult problems to overcome. Nevertheless, the social importance of family agriculture to this region justifies the efforts to build the necessary institutional infra-structure to accomplish the implementation of a wastewater reuse policy.

Abstract The Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenth century heralded great changes for the planet. As a result, years later, environmental disasters caused thousands of deaths and, from the end of the 1960s, called attention to the need for reforms in the industrial system of production and consumption. Through a review of available bibliography, this paper describes such environmental disasters, which triggered a worldwide movement of environmental awareness, giving rise to conferences held by private organizations and governments to find a way to reconcile the economy with the conservation of the environment, maintain the balance of ecosystems, and ensure that people's health is not impaired by unsustainable production and consumption systems. After describing fifty years of history, we arrive at the present time with significant changes and also a certain complacency with respect to environmental issues, which are still seen as obstacles to economic growth, despite continued efforts to change this paradigm.

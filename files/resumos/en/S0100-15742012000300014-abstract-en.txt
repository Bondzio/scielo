This paper presents findings from a broader piece of research aiming at investigating teachers' perspectives and experiences of professional development in connection with collaboration at the workplace. Data were collected through questionnaires, interviews, accounts and written reflections in a school in Northern Portugal. Findings point to the valorization of formal training, recognizing also the importance of other opportunities such as collaborative work with colleagues. However, collaboration is more related to extracurricular projects and not at a pedagogical and classroom level. Training at the workplace is then a key strategy to promote professional development and to challenge professional cultures marked by isolation.

Abstract This article explores the moral and sensual logic of work, trying to supplement the excessively technical interpretations of work through the study of the contextualized and embodied practices of workers. In this sense, the researcher conducted a participant observation inquiry in 2007, working as a machine operator during 14 weeks in a furniture plant in Portugal. One year later, he returned to study the surrounding community for more 16 weeks. Using the sociological objectivation on the visceral experiences of work, it was possible to know the embodiment process of a practical sense, locally known as "learning the art". Due to its methodological relevance, a special attention is given to the consequences that the participant observation brought to this research.

This paper highlights the relevance of the connection between environmental health and scientific literacy. It takes a historical approach looking at the contribution of environmental health to scientific literacy and it analyzes a contemporary case: air pollution and human health in urban areas. We recognize the importance of learning about daily exposure in large cities with regard to air and the effects on human health when air quality deteriorates. This allows establishing air as an indicator of environmental health and a relevant benchmark to be included in scientific literacy in order for individuals to be able to make responsible decisions for the well-being of healthy persons, and communities.

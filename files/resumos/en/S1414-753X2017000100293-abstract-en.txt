Abstract The organizational forms of LPAs and GIs become the object of public policies, but above all, a space for collective actions. The article explores two questions: first, why a good governance of an LPA is fundamental to the implementation of a collective strategy (and brand) like GI?; second, how the local governing body of an LPA can assume the role of managing the GI on behalf of all producers of a geographical region? To answer them, the article makes use of two research methods: desk research and two case studies of LPAs of coffee (Cerrado Mineiro Region) and fruits (Ja√≠ba Region) in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Finally, a cyclical analysis gives rise to theoretical propositions, which are learning points to the theme of governance and strategic management of LPAs and GIs.

Abstract This article aims to analyse the revisions in the discourses of pentecostal actors regarding homosexuality, family and human rights. To this end, the focus is to examine two public hearings and the voting of the Family Law in the special committee designed to discuss the proposal presented by a Christian Congressman in the Federal House of Representatives. At first, I consider the public hearing held in the Human Rights Committee about the ex-homosexuals. Next, the hearing in the Family Law Special Committee is discussed. In the third section, I examine the main points of the Opinion Report concerning the bill 6583/2013 and the discussions held among Congressmen. In the final considerations, in view of changes in the discourse involving religious values, scientific arguments and a restrictive conception of human rights, I state that the present politicians showed once more that the ideological orientation in that debate was given by Pentecostal Congressmen.

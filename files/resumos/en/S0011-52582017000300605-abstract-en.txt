ABSTRACT Written by the editor of DADOS &#8211; Revista de CiÃªncias Sociais for over three decades, the following article-report provides an introduction to the archive formed over the 50 years since the journal&#8217;s first publication (1966-2016). The various phases of the journal are divided into the periods adopted over the five decades (biannual, four-monthly and quarterly) in order to analyze the main shifts in the decision-making process, editorial projects and in the receiving of the journal by the main national and international indices. The path taken by the journal over the years is also linked to wider transformations to the political and intellectual context, as well as that of scientific publishing.

Abstract: In this interview, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro discusses the "two LÃ©vi-Strauss" beginning with a reflection on Mythologiques, the series crowned by The story of Lynx. In this sequence of studies one can observe a progressive "ethnologization" of the analytical scope of structural anthropology. This movement is an ambiguous one, with ups and downs, but it is clear in The story of Lynx, where one realizes the importance of "openness to others", theme that would connect to the philosophical and ethical sources of Amerindian dualism. Therefore, analyzing The story of Lynx is concerned with the specificity of indigenous people's thought about the human issue. From the first volume of Mythologiques to The story of Lynx one also sees a Greek mythology, philosophical starting point of the author, albeit never explicitly revealed, transforming into an Amerindian mythology.

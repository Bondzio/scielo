The article deals with the contemporary relevance of the concept of &#8220;revolutionary reforms&#8221;, formulated by Andr√© Gorz in the 1960s, and resumed in his more recent writings. My theses here is that such concept remains actually valid, and it has been, direct or indirectly, appropriated by other social-theorists, though sometimes using a different language. To develop my argument, I begin by presenting the contours of the concept. Then, I show how Gorz uses it along with his writings. And to conclude, I discuss it through the works of other authors by focusing on some themes of contemporary debates.

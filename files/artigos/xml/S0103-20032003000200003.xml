Introduction </b></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The effects of technological change in Brazilian agriculture in the 1980s reconfigured economic and social relationships in the country’s rural area. Non-agricultural employment slowly entered what had been an essentially agricultural space, often relegating traditional agriculture to a part-time activity.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">As shown by Graziano da Silva (1997) and Campanhola and Graziano da Silva (2000), in the 1990s, the growth of Brazil’s rural economically active population (PEA) was superior to the growth of agricultural PEA. Between 1992 and 1998, Brazil’s agricultural PEA decreased an average of 2.4% annually while, counteracting a contraction of total rural PEA, rural non-agricultural PEA grew at an average annual rate of 3.6%. In regards to income concentration in the rural areas of Brazil during the 1980s and 1990s, Correa (2000) found that</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><i>&quot;Among Brazilian areas, the Center-West    region had the highest values of inequality indexes at the end of the nineties    while the Northeast is shown as the area with smallest income inequality index    values. The Real Plan period, 1995-98, registers growth of inequality in the    State of S&atilde;o Paulo and the Center-West region, with some reduction in    other regions and in the country as a whole. Also from 1992 to 1998 (rural)    inequality is reduced in Brazil as a whole, as well as in the Southeast and    the Northeast, though presenting unequivocal growth in S&atilde;o Paulo. The    reduction in inequality that is observed in Brazil in the nineties reverses    the trend toward inequality growth in the previous decade; and values of inequality    indices in 1998 become similar to those at the beginning of the eighties.&quot;</i></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects of this new occupational configuration on income distribution in the Brazilian rural area. We make use of two measures of income concentration, the variation coefficient and the Gini Index, and an application of methodology to decompose these indicators’ values to verify which specific income sources exacerbate rural income concentration. We will also investigate the effect of income coming from the rural social security system (retirement and pension income) on the distribution of household income in rural Brazil. Delgado’s (2000) recent work found that the Brazilian social security system is becoming more inclusive, "[now] including informal work (regime of family economy) as part of the universal criterion for social security benefits, and through this aspect revolutionizing the conventional social security system, which had been based on formal salaried work." This change increased the system’s coverage, making it more effective as a policy to combat hunger and poverty.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">It is hoped that our work will contribute to    public policies that focus on and stimulate activities that promote more balanced    and equitable rural development.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>2. Methodology </b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2">We will accomplish the decomposition of the income concentration measures (variation coefficient and the Gini index) following the procedure proposed by Shorrocks (1982) and Ercelawn (1984). The calculation is based on 1992 and 1999 PNAD microdata for individuals. We separated the people living in rural households and joined the income per household, obtaining, for each year, a data file per household. The income data were divided by the number of people in the household (including aggregate people) in order to obtain the per capita household income from each source of considered income. We considered a sample of 18,580 rural households for 1992 and 21,694 for 1999. These samples represent Brazil’s 7,266,365 rural households in 1992 and 7,997,178 in 1999.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Per capita household total income, <B><I>y,</i></B> is subdivided into four different income sources: agricultural income, non-agricultural income, transfer income (interpersonal, retirement pensions, other pensions, etc.), and income from interest, rents, and leases. These income sources will be designated   <B><I>y<SUB>1</sub></i></B>, <B><I>y<SUB>2</sub></i></B>, <B><I>y<SUB>3,</sub> y<SUB>4</sub></i></B>   respectively, so that </font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">y = y<sub>1</sub> + y<sub>2</sub> + y<sub>3</sub> + y<sub>4</sub></font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="verdana" size="2">The variance of the total income,    <font face="symbol">s</font><sup>2</sup>, can be written as the sum of the variances    of each income source, <font face="symbol">s</font><sup>2</sup><sub>i</sub>,    and the double of the covariance between different income sources, <font face="symbol">s</font><sub>ij</sub>:    </font></p>     <p align="center"> <img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a3fo1.gif"> </p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The contribution of each i<SUP>th</SUP> income source in the composition of the total variance consists of the sum of the i<SUP>th</SUP> variance of income and the part of the covariance allocated to the i<SUP>th</SUP> source. One of the decomposition criterion is to allocate to the i<SUP>th</SUP> source exactly half of all the covariance that involve the i<SUP>th</SUP> income source. We can decompose the variance of total income as follows:</font></p>     <p align="center"> <img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a3fo2.gif"></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">in other words, the absolute contribution of    each i-th source of income can be measured by its covariance with total income    <a name="vnota1"></a>y<sup><a href="#nota1">1</a></sup>. The relative contribution is the same and    the inequality is measured by the variance or by the variation coefficient.    We adopted the variation coefficient because this measure of inequality respects    the axiom of independence of averages: its value doesn't change if a proportional    change in all the incomes occurs.. The decomposition of the variation coefficient    will be made through the following terms: </font></p>     <p align="center"> <img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a3fo3.gif"></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Where </font></p>     ]]></body>

Figures given in <a href="#tab5">tables 5</a> and <a href="#tab6">6</a> indicate    that this source of income tends to reduce income concentration in the studied    rural regions. For the Brazilian rural area as a whole in 1992 (<a href="#tab5">Table    5</a>), c<SUB>3</SUB> (relative coefficient of concentration) had value of 0.5850,    g<SUB>3 </SUB>had value of 1.0007, w<SUB>3</SUB>c<SUB>3 </SUB>(weighted inequality)    had a value of 0.1247 (for the variation coefficient), and w<SUB>3</SUB>g<SUB>3    </SUB>had a value of 0.2133 (for the Gini Index). In 1999 (<a href="#tab6">Table    6</a>), c<SUB>3</SUB> and g<SUB>3 </SUB>have slightly diminished from their    1992 values, to 0.5528 and 0.9588 respectively. This fact corroborates Delgado’s    (2000) work and reinforces the conclusion that the system of universal rural    social security/welfare instituted by the 1998 Brazilian Constitution helps    to reduce poverty and hunger in the country’s rural areas. Our study also verifies    that the component of income corresponding to retirement, transfer, and pension    payments acts to mitigate income concentration in the Brazilian rural area,    an important empirical result.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">To better identify the income concentrating effect    of specific non-agricultural activities, we subdivided this broad income category    into several principal branches. The results of this sub-division for 1999 are    given in <a href="#tab7">Table 7</a>. In this table, Income21 refers to per    capita household income from the Transforming Industries, Construction Industry,    and Other Industrial Activities; Income22 refers to the income from Commerce;    Income23 consists of income from Services, Auxiliary Services of an Economic    Activity, and Transport and Communications; and Income24 refers to income from    Social, Public Administration and Other Activities (according to the classification    adopted in PNAD).</font></p>     <p><a name="tab7"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a3t7i.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">For the Brazilian rural zone as a whole, the    Social, Public Administration, and Other Activities branch of non-agricultural    activities enlarged global non-agricultural activities’ income concentration    in 1999, with c<SUB>24</SUB> equal to 1.5947. The contribution of this group    to the coefficient of global variation was 42.47% (w<SUB>24</SUB>c<SUB>24</SUB>).    In region I (Northeast states and Tocantins), Social, Public Administration    and Other Activities was again the non-agricultural activities branch that enlarged    non-agricultural income concentration, with c<SUB>24 </SUB>= 1.9312 and w<SUB>24</SUB>c<SUB>24</SUB>    = 0.6027. In region II, the Commerce branch contributed to increase non-agricultural    income concentration. In region III, both the Commerce branch and the Services    branch contributed to increase the concentration of income from non-agricultural    activities. In region IV, industrial activities (income21-including Civil Construction)    were greatly responsible for increasing income concentration (c<SUB>21 </SUB>=    1.1707), distinguishing it from the other regions, but the Social, Public Administration    and Other Activities branch contributed the most to the global value of the    index (w<SUB>24</SUB>c<SUB>24</SUB> = 0.5178).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>       <p><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>4. Conclusions </b></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Non-agricultural activities constitute an important source of employment generation in the rural area in opposition to the reduction of agricultural employment. It is observed there was an increase in average Brazilian rural income from non-agricultural activities in the 1990s. By the end of that decade, they had become more important than agricultural activities as a source of income in region I (Northeast states and Tocantins) and region IV (Mato Grosso do Sul, S&atilde;o Paulo, and Distrito Federal). For Brazil as a whole, average non-agricultural income was 55.27% of average agricultural income in 1992; by 1999 this relationship had risen to 97.45%. In region IV, this relationship rose to 253.82%, showing the high potential for income generation from non-agricultural activities.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2"> However, income generated by non-agricultural activities has the peculiarity of enlarging the concentration of rural income, which is evidenced by the larger than unit coefficients of relative concentration (c<SUB>i</SUB> and g<SUB>i</SUB>) calculated in our study and made more evident in the cases of Brazilian regions IV and I. This finding indicates that there is not a direct relationship between the phenomenon of income concentration and the level of agricultural or rural development in the regions.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The income concentrating function of non-agricultural activities results from the influence of different branches of non-agricultural activity, with the influence of each branch varying by region. For the country as a whole, the Social, Public Administration, and Other Activities branch of non-agricultural activities (Income24) contributed 42.47% of the total concentration of Brazilian non-agricultural income in1999, as shown by the weighted inequality factor (w<SUB>i</SUB>c<SUB>i</SUB>) for Income24 in <a href="#tab7">Table 7</a>. In region II, the Commerce non-agricultural activity branch further enlarges income concentration, with a relative participation in total income inequality from non-agricultural activities of 27.33%. In region III, both Commerce and Services activity branches further enlarge income concentration. In region IV, the branch formed by Social, Public Administration and Other activities, and to a somewhat lesser extent, the industrial activities branch (Incom21) participate to enlarge income concentration from non-agricultural activities, 51.78% and 32.21% respectively. Many activities can have a high concentration coefficient (c<SUB>i</SUB> or g<SUB>i</SUB>), indicating that they increase income concentration but may make a relatively reduced contribution to income concentration (w<SUB>i</SUB>c<SUB>i</SUB> or w<SUB>i</SUB>g<SUB>i</SUB>), such as the case of Income22 (Commerce) in Region III (Minas Gerais, Esp&iacute;rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro and Goi&aacute;s).</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Undoubtedly, non-agricultural activities contribute to augment rural household income, but these activities are perniciously revealed to have made an ineffective contribution to lessen the great distortion in income distribution among Brazil’s rural population. To alleviate this distortion, the impacts of the different branches of rural activity on family welfare need to be identified. This study has preliminarily identified some of these impacts, which may be very important in the construction of Brazilian rural development policies.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">This work also verifies that retirement, transfer, and pension payments reduce income concentration, reaffirming previous findings regarding the effectiveness of the rural social security and welfare systems in the mitigation of income concentrating tendencies.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>References </b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="verdana" size="2">ADAMS JR, R.H. &amp; HE,J.J. 1995.

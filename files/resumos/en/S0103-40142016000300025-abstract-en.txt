ABSTRACT The field of the Human Dimensions of Climate Change there is a rich debate grounded in the theoretical frameworks of the Social Science on how responses to climate change are intrinsically related to local factors and determinants that shape adaptive processes in different systems. Other theoretical-analytical possibilities, also focused on adaptation, vulnerability and adaptive capacity, have sought to explore intersections with the literatures on resilience and sustainable development. In this paper, the authors provide a critical review of these theoretical perspectives, and propose a reflection on the Brazilian context and the adjustment processes needed to anticipate and respond to climate impact in the cities. Drawing on empirical studies in Brazil, the authors of this paper advocate the need for a set of critical variables (and an analysis of possible synergies and tradeoffs amongst them) in future studies focused on analyzing the Brazilian context.

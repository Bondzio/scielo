ABSTRACT Studies on the training of the special education teacher in multi-functional resource classes - MRC - are important because they verify what is being done, what are the difficulties faced and where more investment is required. This study aimed to analyze the opinions of MRC teachers regarding their training. A large scale, online questionnaire was submitted to MRC teachers nationwide. Data was collected from 1,202 teachers from 20 states and in more than 150 cities. Most participants highlighted both the need for a second professional in the MRC as well as the lack of preparation. Teachers pointed to training as a means of improving their knowledge. In addition, most teachers felt recognized by schools and families.

Organic waste composes more than half of municipal solid waste (MSW) collected in Brazil and most of it is not transformed into compost, creating serious environmental problems. This study aimed to: i) identify composting experiences of MSW developed in the state of São Paulo; ii) characterize the dynamics of the modalities identified; and iii) give an overview of MSW composting in the state. The characterization of the identified experiences allowed us to group them into six modalities within two management models: centralized and decentralized. Opportunities, challenges and demands have been observed for organizing efficient systems to collaborate with municipal management and produce quality compost for agriculture. The research has shown that organic waste brought into an efficient composting route has its recovery process interrupted, returning to landfills. This indicates that the National Policy of Solid Waste has not been sufficient to prioritize composting in cities in São Paulo state.

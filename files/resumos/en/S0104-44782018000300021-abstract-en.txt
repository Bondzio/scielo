ABSTRACT  Introduction This paper analyzes Process Tracing (PT) and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) both as methodologies (research design) and methods (protocols/procedures for data analysis), as well as their methodological integration (QCA+PT).  Methods A review of the contemporary literature on theoretical and empirical developments of QCA and PT is carried out to evaluate its contributions to policy analysis.  Results It is argued that these methodologies are demonstrating that they can improve the study of policies because they show a better alignment (ontology-methodology-theory-methods) with the nature of the object of study: they are more effective to treat the limited number of cases; address causal complexity (multiple and context-dependent) in policy design/implementation; assume asymmetric causality (success and failure of a policy have different explanations); consider time as a causal factor itself; produce causal statements in the form of contingently necessary/sufficient conditions.  Discussion In meta-theoretical terms, these methodologies provide a basis for critical realist approach to public policy.

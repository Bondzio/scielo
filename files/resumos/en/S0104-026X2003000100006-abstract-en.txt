The paper examines the problematic relation between the artistic production of women, feminism and the politically-oriented movements in the 1970's in Mexico. Based on interviews with some of the most important Mexican women artists, the author argues that neither feminism nor the Left gave support to women's art in its struggle for new structures, a new aesthetics, and a differentiated feminist practice.

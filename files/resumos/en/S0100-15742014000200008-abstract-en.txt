This paper analyzes the problem of care from the perspective of women who benefit from social programs. The methodology used is based on a constructionist paradigm using a qualitative approach. The findings show the complex intersection, based on the analysis of care, between uncertain/impoverished processes in urban environments and the demographic processes of an aging population, as well as the fragmentation and lack of policies and programs for the elderly population. This paper highlights the urgent collectivization of care through complementary relations between state institutions and their inclusive social protection function, the market and its need for regulation, the civil society and its organizations, and the heterogeneity within families and from a new gender contract which redistributes the burden of care on the basis of the principle of equity.

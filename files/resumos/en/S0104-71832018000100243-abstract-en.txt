Abstract This article is based on ethnographic research carried out in the region known as Cracolândia in the center of São Paulo, considered the most famous territoriality of crack use in the country. Its purpose is to discuss an operation to include beneficiaries in a municipal project from the experience of a young woman excluded from the program. I try to deal with the modes of operation, practices and categories triggered by the agents in this intervention, problematizing the notion of vulnerability, as well as their effects on the trajectory of this character. Grounding on her urban path and reflections, my argument is that the State creats &#8220;mazes&#8221; by inducting and conditioning people&#8217;s movements in the city.

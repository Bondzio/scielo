Abstract: This article shows the importance of the life course, intertwined with gender perspective to analyze the processes of decision-making of Brazilian women about migrate (or not) to the Netherlands to live with their Dutch partners. According to interlocutors of ethnographic research conducted between 2012 and 2013, age is an important factor to be considered to analyse the risks, advantages and disadvantages of migration. Besides age, other markers of life course, like having children, the birth of grandchildren and the children age are also considered in their decision-making processes. The article also provides the considerations of the interlocutors of research on love, which, according to them, differs at every stage of life. More than love for the Dutch boyfriend or husband, they emphasize and reify the idealization of maternal love.

Abstract The article discusses the adoption process of the representation of professional associations in the Brazilian Constituent Assembly of 1933-34 and examines the relationship between the model of electoral governance that governed the choice of these representatives and the Electoral Justice, the Electoral Office deployed in the same period, in order to promote electoral truth in the definition of popular representation. The development of this work is focused on manifestos, interviews, newspaper articles and documents of the time, the legislation produced in the period 1932-33 (the case of the Electoral Code, the series of decrees of the Provisional Government and the Constitution of 1934), and the Electoral Justice action in the resolution of contentious arising from this process.

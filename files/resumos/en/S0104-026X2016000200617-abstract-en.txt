Abstract: This article aims to make a critical reading of the report Progress of the World's Women 2015-2016. Transforming Economies, Realizing Rights of UN-Women. After arguing that the report is distinguished by having as analytical reference the rich contributions of feminist studies in the discussion of gender inequalities, it tries to point out some shortcomings, namely, the absence of debate on international migration and urban mobility that severely affect class and gender inequalities.

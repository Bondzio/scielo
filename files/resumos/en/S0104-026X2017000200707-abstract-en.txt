Abstract: In this article, I show how, in a backwoods town of Minas Gerais, the women&#8217;s management practices in the kitchen and their worry about events of the body are central to the way in which social relations are conceived. I suggest that the local expression &#8220;mexida de cozinha&#8221; (kitchen&#8217;s business and kitchen&#8217;s movement) reveals a mode of action and movement that put on continuity physiological and social processes. The matter of food offers then a peculiar way of thinking about the social system.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although there is not an international forest   convention, there is a comprehensive set of international processes,   non-binding instruments (soft law), institutions with a forest mandate and   private regulations. Literature mentions the existence of an international   forest regime (Abdalla 2007; Gulbrandsen 2004; Humphreys 2006), but the authors   themselves point to its fragmentation, lack of complementarity and various   inconsistencies. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I propose the concept of a quasi-regime for the   protection of forests. This concept is based on the understanding that the mass   of political and technical instruments, whether public or private, does not   amount to a framework of principles, rules and expectations around which   actors' expectations converge, as Krasner (1983) postulates in his classical   definition of international regimes.     I also consider that another fundamental attribute for a regime is its   effectiveness (Young 1999; Sprinz 2007; Dimitrov 2005). Therefore, the sum of   existing public and private institutions and instruments, binding and   non-binding, directly or indirectly connected to the issue of forests, is in a   stage that is inferior to the existence of an international regime. Besides its   very low level of implementation and effectiveness, its lack of coordination   and the absence of clear institutional mandates make it hard to map both   stakeholders and expectations around which it should converge. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although a regime does not exist, its absence is not   the reality either. For Keohane and Nye (2001), such a situation means the   nonexistence of agreed norms and procedures, or that the exception to the rule   is more relevant than its existence. Therefore, I consider that the   problematics of international forest policy is in an intermediate locus between   the existence and nonexistence of a regime: a quasi-regime. There is minimal   convergence around requirements for an international forest policy: sustainable   forest management, protected areas, compatibilization between environmental   protection and international trade, rights of forest peoples, among others.   There is also a set of principles that is weak but brings those international   arrangements close to an international regime. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main institutions and instruments of the   international forest quasi-regime are the Food and Agriculture Organization of   the United Nations (FAO), which had a controversial role in the 1980s, and now   prioritizes financial and technical assistance through National Forest   Programmes; the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) and the International   Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA), which bring together producer and consumer   countries to regulate the trade of tropical woods and the sustainable use of   forests, although this last objective has always been secondary; the World   Bank, which also had a controversial role in the 1980s and 1990s funding   projects with massive impact, but later developed operational policies and   procedures aimed at reducing that impact; the United Nations Forum on Forests   (UNFF), connected to the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) with virtually   global membership and responsible for the implementation of the Non-Binding   Forest Principles (1992) and their developments; and the Convention on   Biological Diversity (CBD), which provides a framework for conservation and   sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits   connected to that use.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate   Change (UNFCCC) is also part of the international forest quasi-regime and has   recently become the main international forum for discussions on forests.   Forests are considered sources<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a>, sinks<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a>,   and reservoirs<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a> of greenhouse gases (GHG), so they are   at the same time part of the problem of global warming, as they emit greenhouse   gases from burning and clear-cutting, and part of the solution of the problem   as they mitigate its effects through carbon storage, removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and keeping it in their biomass while they grow.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Data from the 4<sup>th</sup> Assessment Report of the   IPCC (2007) estimate that CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from deforestation and   land-use change amount to 17% of global emissions. So the forest sector is the   third largest emission source, behind the energy (26%) and industry (19%)   sectors and followed by the agriculture (14%) and transportation (13%) sectors.   The multiple role of forests is a very complex and disputed issue in the   negotiations on climate change since the preparatory meetings to the United   Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) up to now. This is   due to the economic valuation of those ecosystems in the context of   emissions-reductions market schemes.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>International policy   on forests and climate change:     from the legal to the economic sphere</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This section focuses on the shift of the international   discussion on forests from a legal perspective, connected with territorial and   sovereignty issues, to an economic perspective, connected to the environmental   service of carbon sequestration provided by forests. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The forest window within the climate change regime was   opened right after the UNCED in 1992, where the discussions on an international   forest convention ended with a weak compromise that is reflected in the name of   the document adopted: <i>Non-Legally     Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the     Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of All Types of Forests</i>.   At that time the tone of international discussions on forests was the   sovereignty of countries over their natural resources. During the negotiation   process previous to the UNCED, the most disputed issues regarding the proposal   of a convention on forests were the concepts of guardianship or stewardship of   forest resources to guarantee the fulfillment of needs of present and future   generations and common good/common heritage of mankind (Humphreys 2006). </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, open for   ratification in UNCED, is "to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas   concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous   anthropogenic interference with the climate system" (UNFCCC, Art. 2). In 1997   the Kyoto Protocol defined that this objective should be reached through   reductions of GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from   direct human-induced land-use change and forestry activities, limited to   afforestation, reforestation and deforestation since 1990. The position by some   countries, such as Brazil, that forestry projects threatened the principle of   common but differentiated responsibilities of the UNFCCC was coherent with the   political discourse and views on that matter at that time.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before Kyoto, in 1995, a pilot phase of Activities   Implemented Jointly (AIJ) was defined in the UNFCCC. This phase involved the   pioneer forestry projects for climate change mitigation in developing countries   with investments from developed countries. As valuable lessons have been   generated under the AIJ framework, the Conference of the Parties has decided   they should go on indefinitely, although reductions of emissions are not   considered to fulfill Kyoto commitments (Dec. 14/CP.8). The biggest investors   were Sweden and the US. Under this framework there are 157 projects, 40 of   which located in South America. Brazil did not host any AIJ; the country   strongly opposed such activities that shifted the burden of emissions   reductions by Annex I countries to developing countries. There are only 17   forestry projects for reforestation, preservation and afforestation (UNFCCC, 7<sup>th</sup> Synthesis Report, 2006).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1997, in order to reach the ultimate objective of   the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol established "quantified emission limitation or   reduction commitments," which are targets for Annex I parties that can be   reached through domestic actions and supplementary flexible mechanisms that   allow cost-efficiency in reductions. The Protocol established three flexible   mechanisms: joint implementation, which allows Annex I parties to jointly   achieve their reduction targets based on an agreement between them that sets   out the respective emission level allocated to each one; emissions trading,   which allows Annex I parties to transfer to or acquire from each other emission   reductions from projects aimed at reducing anthropogenic emissions by sources   or enhancing anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases; and the Clean   Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows Annex I parties to invest in project   activities in non-Annex I parties and use the certified emission reductions   from such project activities to contribute to compliance with part of their   targets (Kyoto Protocol, Articles 4 and 12).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It can be argued that Kyoto is a cap-and-trade system.   Cap-and-trade was first put in place in the US in the 1990s as the result of an   alliance between the government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) aiming   at controlling the pollution caused by substances that caused acid rain (Coniff   2009). Cap-and-trade is an alternative to traditional command-and-control   policies. Simply put, there is a regulating entity that establishes a cap (a   maximum target of emissions) and each party or entity that is covered by the   system is assigned an amount of emissions for a period. At the end of the   period the covered party or entity has to demonstrate it complied with its   allowed share, either through emission reductions or purchasing reductions from   other parties. Kyoto established a cap (reduction of emissions of at least 5%   below 1990 levels in the commitment period of 2008 to 2012, Art. 3) and parties   have specific emission reductions targets that can be achieved through a mix of   alternatives, such as trading or investing in projects in developing countries.   Therefore, Kyoto created a carbon market with a supplementary role to domestic   measures.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important to highlight that the expression   "carbon market" is broader than the official market under the UNFCCC. Lecocq   and Ambroise (2007) define carbon market as the sum of all transactions in   which one or more parties pay each other or a set of parties for a certain   amount of emission reduction credits. Those credits theoretically represent   real emission reductions, which could be used by countries in reaching their   Kyoto targets or by industries to comply with national legislations, or even as   voluntary reductions for corporate responsibility or public-relations purposes.   Those reductions are called offsets. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the flexible mechanisms described above, the   Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is the only one that allows for the   participation of developing countries (or non-Annex I parties). It aims at   helping those countries to achieve sustainable development and Annex I parties   to comply with their quantified emission reduction commitments, therefore   contributing to the ultimate objective of the Convention. Its rationale is that   non-Annex I parties will benefit from projects financed by Annex I parties that   will result in certified emission reductions (CER), the so-called carbon   credits, which can be used by Annex I parties to fulfill part of their   commitments. Afforestation<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> and reforestation<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a> are   the only eligible forestry CDM project activities. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is relevant to notice that few forestry projects   have been approved under the CDM. As of August 2012, there are only 39   afforestation and reforestation projects out of 4,396 projects registered by   the CDM Executive Board (CDM Registry 2012). Some factors that could explain this   is the low international demand for forest credits; the high complexity of   technical requirements; high transaction costs with low profits; and the fact   that forest credits are temporary<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a>. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The role of flexible mechanisms in the climate change   regime brings up a broader discussion on equity, justice and the environmental   integrity of the climate change regime. The principle of common but   differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities implies that Annex   I countries should take the first step in emission reductions in their   territory. Besides that, they should financially contribute and transfer   technology to allow developing countries to fulfill their commitments under the   UNFCCC. There are equity and justice issues if those mechanisms actually mean   shifting the burden of mitigation to developing countries. The environmental   integrity of the regime will be threatened if the use of offsets is unlimited,   which could delay domestic efforts to reduce emissions that would keep on   increasing. That would be a zero-sum game for the global climate: countries   would gain time to invest in technology and to introduce emission cuts, but the   global warming threat would intensify and demand even stronger interventions   and investments. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brunnengraber (2007) divides the international policy   of climate change in two phases. The first one is up to 1997, when the issues   on the table were the equitable discussion of per capita emissions, the   connection between poverty, wealth and environmental degradation, historical   responsibility for climate change and the need of transferring substantial   funds from developed to developing countries. The second phase starts with the   adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, when the focus was narrowed to economic   matters due to the fact that the fossil fuel industry noticed the relevance or   the threat of that instrument to its interests. Economic measures, new   technologies and financial instruments are the issues that dominate   negotiations. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The valuation of the economic service of carbon   storage provided by forests, with its inherent political, technical and   economic complexities, has become a more relevant discussion in the   international arena than other aspects of the forest problematics such as   rights of indigenous peoples, protected areas and international drivers of   deforestation. A recent phenomenon is the connection of such issues to the   Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation programme (REDD+)<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a> discussions in the UNFCCC. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>REDD+: UNFCCC as a "Forest Convention"?</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 2004 a group of Brazilian and international NGOs   started to manifest their support to a mechanism that could compensate tropical   forest countries for reducing deforestation. In 2005 a group of countries led   by Papua New Guinea made a submission to the UNFCCC for the inclusion of this   proposal in the agenda of the next Conference of the Parties (COP-12, in   Nairobi). This proposal, which was supported by Brazil, was accepted by the   COP. Brazil would present its own proposal in 2006. In 2007, at COP-13, in   Bali, REDD+ was included in the Bali Action Plan, the decision that opened the   negotiations for a new period of the climate change regime after 2012. Those negotiations   were supposed to come to term in 2009, in Copenhagen, which did not happen. In   2011, in Durban, the COP defined a new mandate for negotiations up to 2015 for   an agreement including developed and developing countries to be adopted in   2020. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 2005 onwards the discussion on REDD+ has become   polarized. A first position, defended by Brazil, is that it should be financed   by public funds and not a market mechanism to maintain the environmental   integrity of the mitigation system. The opponent position is that REDD+ should   be included in a market mechanism to generate offsets, which is defended by the   Coalition for Rainforest Nations, a group within the G-77 that includes Papua   New Guinea, Costa Rica and other countries that signed the submission in 2005.   Brazil is not a part of this group.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The discussion on REDD+ has also become much more   complex since 2005. Issues on the table are how to involve countries with   different scientific and technical capacities; how to tackle the various   drivers of deforestation in each country or region; how to connect benefits at   the local level and emissions reductions at the local level; how to make REDD+   contribute to poverty reduction and the conservation of other natural resources   such as biodiversity, water and soils; how to guarantee that local communities   and indigenous peoples can benefit from such a mechanism. In 2009 REDD+ went   through passionate debates that reflected the diversity of views among   countries on how to deal with it. The main points of discussion were the   following:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1.&nbsp;        Scope     of the mechanism:</b> the inclusion of other activities mentioned in the     Bali Action Plan besides reducing deforestation, and degradation, i.e.     conservation, enhancement of stocks, and sustainable forest management. Some     countries question the inclusion of activities that do not directly reduce     emissions. On the other side are countries with low deforestation rates and     high forest stocks, for whom a mechanism that rewards only countries with high     deforestation rates could create perverse incentives and foster unsustainable     activities. In Copenhagen a consensus that the mechanism should include all     activities mentioned in the Bali Action Plan should be considered under a REDD+     framework. </font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2.&nbsp;        Co-benefits:</b> REDD+ projects, programs or strategies should generate other benefits besides     reducing emissions, such as maintaining and improving other environmental     services. </font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>3.&nbsp;        Avoiding     conversion of native forests:</b> REDD+ projects or strategies should     not become an incentive for converting native forests to monocultures of exotic     species of rapid growth which could be more efficient in removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. </font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>4.&nbsp;        Rights     of indigenous peoples and local communities:</b> this is one of the     hottest issues on REDD+ discussion, given the demand by Indigenous Peoples     representatives that countries acknowledge the United Nations Declaration on     Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). However, this declaration is a non-binding     document that has not yet been signed by the United States. The US, however,     accepted a formulation that mentioned "taking note" of the UNDRIP. The rights     that should be considered are territorial rights; full participation; free,     prior and informed consent; and equitable benefit sharing. </font></p>       ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>5.&nbsp;        REDD+     as a nationally-appropriated mitigation action (NAMA):</b> views diverge     on the role of REDD+ in the international climate regime. One option is that     REDD+ initiatives could generate emission reductions to be converted in carbon     credits/offsets which could be used by developed countries to compensate     emissions from sources. Other option defended by Brazil is to consider REDD+ a     NAMA, which would be part of the voluntary domestic actions of developing     countries with the financial       and technological support from developed countries, therefore not generating     offsets. </font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>6.&nbsp;        Finance:</b> the main contentious issue on REDD+ discussions, as already mentioned, is the     kind of financial resources that should maintain such a mechanism. For Brazil,     including REDD+ in a market mechanism threatens the environmental integrity of     the regime as issues of permanence and leakage have not yet been solved. For     the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, a carbon market is predictable, robust     and stable and therefore is the safest financial mechanism. This view is     supported by developed countries which are interested in cost-effective     emission reductions options, such as the USA and Norway. The European Union is     against a carbon market for REDD+ and even CDM forest credits are not allowed     in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), but it has not proposed alternative     mechanisms or pledged significant additional public funds for REDD+.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Considering the variety of issues presently at stake   on the construction of a REDD+ mechanism under the UNFCCC, it can be argued   that the Convention is expected to solve many gaps that remain unsolved in   other instruments of the quasi-regime on forests, such as Indigenous Peoples'   and local communities' forest tenure rights and the conservation of natural   resources other than forests under the co-benefits. It is necessary to go back   to the ultimate objective of the Convention, which is reducing anthropogenic   emissions of greenhouse gases, and to also consider who the country   representatives are and their capacity and mandate to deal with such issues. In   a world constrained by a financial crisis, it seems natural that claims will   migrate to where the financial resources and the political relevance in the   international agenda are located. But will the UNFCCC be able to deal with such   a broad array of issues? The answer to this question remains unknown and   unlikely in the near future, as even the commitments of domestic emission   reductions which form the core of the climate change regime have not yet been   renewed.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B&auml;ckstrand and L&ouml;vbrand (2006) identify three global   environmental governance discourses on the sinks discussion in the UNFCCC:   ecological modernization, green governance, and civic environmentalism.   Ecological modernization focuses on the compatibility between economic growth   and environmental protection, liberal market capitalism and sustainable   development. Cost-effective solutions are preferred over fair and equitable   ones. The green governability discourse is based on a notion of technical and   scientific tutorship of nature and the complete management of its resources.   The experts and scientists that migrated to the environmental policy arena in   the last decades have a relevant role in the construction of such ecological   knowledge. The manifestation of this discourse is prominent on climate change   discussions and it is considered elitist as it marginalizes other types of   understanding of the natural world. Finally, the civic environmentalism   discourse is associated with Rio 92, when the language on stakeholders'   participation entered the international environmental agenda. While the   principle of sovereignty and the privilege of States as the sole   decision-makers in international negotiations remain, the participation of   other groups and non-state actors such as the business sector and NGOs has   created more complex and polycentric governance arrangements.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All three discourses can be identified in the   discussion on forests in the UNFCCC. When the carbon market was created, the   predominant one was ecological modernization, since the rationale of the market   is flexibility and cost efficiency that minimizes the prescription of   obligations and their fulfillment for ethical reasons, such as the   acknowledgment of countries' contribution to the problem. Therefore, it makes   sense to take into account both sources and sinks in a mitigation system.   Another piece of this discourse is the narrative of "maximizing synergies,"   which suggests that projects involving tropical forests combine low-cost   mitigation with sustainable forest management, poverty reduction, local   development, and biodiversity protection (B&auml;ckstrand and L&ouml;vbrand 2006). Green   governability can be perceived in the argument that technical and scientific   constraints that were present in 1997 have been solved. And for countries which   are against REDD+ in a market mechanism that would allow for offsets, civic   environmentalism is a great ally: rights of forest peoples, which are   legitimate stakeholders in the discussion, are threatened by a REDD+ mechanism. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Brazilian position   on forests and climate change:     from veto to proposition</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The positions of States in international environmental   negotiations stem from a balance between external pressure and political and economic   interests and forces both at the domestic and transnational levels. Risks and   costs associated with environmental degradation vary across themes and   countries involved, as do incentives for participation in regimes. Solutions   for the problems at stake are also perceived differently by actors. Therefore,   reaching consensus is a slow and challenging exercise. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chasek, Downie and Brown (2006) highlight the   importance of veto power as one of the main characteristics of global   environmental policy. For each issue there is a country or a group of countries   whose cooperation is so essential for an agreement to succeed that this country   or group could block efficient international action. When those countries   oppose or try to dilute an agreement for any reason, they act either   individually as veto states or collectively, forming veto coalitions. Veto   power is so relevant that even more economically powerful countries have no   means to impose an international agreement on poorer countries if those, for   specific reasons, are fundamental to an agreement and oppose it. Some examples   are the coalition formed by Brazil, Indonesia, Gabon, and Malaysia on Rio 92 to   block an international convention on forests and the Like-Minded Megadiverse   Countries (LMMC) in the Convention for Biological Diversity. Veto power can   also be used as a currency for compensation or more favorable treatment. Within   the UNFCCC, as decisions are taken by consensus, theoretically every country   could veto decisions, but reality is more complex. There are political and   economic asymmetries which qualify countries' veto power. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the analysis of the Brazilian position on forests   in the climate change regime, two distinct phases were identified. The first   one is from 1997 to 2005. In the big picture of climate change negotiations,   Brazil has been considered a leader of the G-77 and China &#150; the coalition of developing   countries &#150; for its strong position of fighting for the adoption of quantified   emission reduction commitments by developed countries and the attribution of   appropriate commitments for developing countries, based on the principle of   common but differentiated responsibilities, which would not curb their right to   development. However, on the specific issue of forests and climate change, in   this first phase Brazil strongly resisted discussing mitigation measures   related to emissions from tropical deforestation and degradation, using the   argument of sovereignty over natural resources as a shelter. That positioned   Brazil as a veto state, opposed to the USA and even countries in the G-77 and   China, such as Costa Rica and Colombia.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The veto power of Brazil on the forest issue in the   international climate regime lies on the following factors: </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.&nbsp;       Brazil possesses the largest area of tropical forests in the world.     About       64% of its territory (about 544 million hectares) is covered by forests     (FAO 2010).</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.&nbsp;       Brazilian GHG emissions differ from other countries' profiles due to the     large share of hydropower in its energetic matrix and the relevance of     deforestation and degradation as emission sources. </font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.&nbsp;       Brazil significantly diminished its deforestation rates from 2005 to     2012, achieving a reduction of 65% since 2004.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4.&nbsp;       Brazilian negotiators have high technical capacity (La Vi&ntilde;a, personal     communication, 2010).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Friberg (2009) considers that Brazil has a proactive   and influential role in the UNFCCC. He describes the Brazilian position as   complex and composed by three lines: responsibility based on the historical   contribution of countries to the problem of climate change; financing for clean   development; and engagement on discussions on forests and the forestry sector.   The last line is the one where Brazil has most efficiently exercised its veto   power, backed by the argument of the lack of technical and scientific certainty   and methodologies on specific issues such as monitoring and carbon accounting.   But for Viola (2004), nationalist values of a relevant share of the national   bureaucracy (the military and institutions responsible for international   relations and promoting development) shaped positions in the 1990s. Therefore,   any international interest related to the Amazon was seen as a threat to   Brazilian sovereignty. It can be then concluded that what really defined the   Brazilian position from 1997 to 2005 were principles and political views, while   solid and coherent technical and scientific arguments were presented. Brazil   used this strategy to effectively oppose the inclusion of native forests in the   Kyoto arrangement of sources and sinks.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although Brazil can be classified as a leader in the   international climate change agenda, its position from 2005 to 2012 cannot be   explained by any of the categories proposed by Chasek, Downie and Brown (2006)<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a>. Brazil cannot be considered a   leader in the issue of forests and climate change for a number of reasons. The   first is that its position on forests has not become the leading one among the   forest countries in the G-77 and China, most of which have adhered to the   market-friendly position led by Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica. The second is   the fact that while Brazil has always demanded that resources should flow from   developed to developing countries for climate change mitigation, the country   has accomplished the huge effort of reducing deforestation with its own   national budget. It seems that Brazil has tacitly adopted the position that   international funds from the climate change regime were not needed for   controlling deforestation. Therefore, countries interested in those funds and   countries interested in purchasing such reductions of emissions in a market   mechanism had the opportunity to strengthen their position in negotiations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, strategic developments took place nationally   in Brazil that, although not connected to the UNFCCC, granted the country an   influential position in negotiations regarding forests. So for the purposes of   this article the Brazilian position is considered to have evolved from a simple   veto to the proposition of alternatives. The subtle transition from not   allowing discussions to progress on an issue that Brazil was not interested in   bringing to the international climate change to participating in discussions   with its own proposal on the table starts in 2005. The landmark is the   submission to the UNFCCC of a proposal of creation of an international fund to   revert forest destruction through "positive incentives for reducing   deforestation." Such proposal has not become the preferred approach for   tropical forest countries, which have moved closer to the proposal by Papua New   Guinea, Costa Rica and other countries of considering native forests in an   offset market mechanism. However, the fact that Brazil is an influent country   that does not agree with offsets has forced the continuity and evolution of   negotiations. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important to mention again that in the UNFCCC   decisions are taken by consensus. It would be therefore legitimate for Brazil   to maintain its veto position regarding the inclusion of native forests in the   regime as it effectively did from 1997 to 2005. But the country has opted for a   constructive and more sophisticated conciliating position, which allows it to   pursue common ground, influence countries, and build convergent points of view   on specific issues of the discussion with the Coalition for Rainforest Nations,   its opponent. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2007 another important development took place.   Brazil, together with China and South Africa, announced its willingness to   adopt voluntary commitments later referred to as "nationally-appropriated   mitigation actions" (NAMAs). This willingness later materialized in domestic   strategies, such as the National Climate Change, which introduced for the first   time a target for deforestation reduction in the Amazon (80% by 2020). The   creation of the Amazon Fund from an arrangement with Norway that built on a   proposal by Brazilian NGOs with the support of Norwegian counterparts has also   become a pillar of the Brazilian position in the Convention. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The year of 2009, which culminated with the   unsuccessful COP-15 in Copenhagen, was specially determinant for the Brazilian   position. Brazil advanced on the adoption of national voluntary commitments to   reduce emissions of 36.1% to 38.9% from business-as-usual by 2020, of which   reducing deforestation is a central strategy. That move has significantly   strengthened Brazil's soft power in the UNFCCC. A new informal coalition, the   one formed by Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC), has emerged in   Copenhagen and was fundamental in negotiating the Copenhagen Accord. The   relevance of the BASIC has been growing as it encompasses the emerging   countries with growing emissions that some Annex I countries would like to see   taking on commitments within the climate change regime. Although the   international arena mapped here was somewhat important, I argue on the next   session that domestic factors were the main reason for the change in the   Brazilian position.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Brazilian domestic framework from 2003 to 2012</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Putnan (1988), questioning whether it is domestic   policy that influences international policy or otherwise is not so relevant, as   the answer is that both influence each other in specific moments. "When" and   "how" that happens are more interesting theoretical questions. For Allison   (1971), international policy positions result from the sum of internal   bargaining games (bureaucratic politics model). Assuming that the transition of   Brazil from veto to proposition is influenced by the domestic political   framework from processes that started in 2003, this session aims at describing   such dynamics which can only be explained by the sum of multiple,   complementary, and non-hierarchical variables.</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The emergence of the   Ministry of the Environment as a relevant     player in climate change negotiations</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within the Federal Government, the institutional   players that built the international position on forests and climate change   from 1997 to 2012 are the Ministry of External Relations &#150; <i>Minist&eacute;rio das Rela&ccedil;&otilde;es Exteriores</i> (MRE) &#150;, the Ministry of the Environment &#150; <i>Minist&eacute;rio     do Meio Ambiente</i> (MMA) &#150;, and the Ministry of Science and Technology   &#150; <i>Minist&eacute;rio da Ci&ecirc;ncia e     Tecnologia</i> (MCT). The evolution in this position reflects a shift in   the power of those players in the policymaking game since 2005: MMA   strengthened and qualified its presence, with the support of the President,   civil society, state governors from the Amazon region, and the private sector. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Brazilian law, the MRE has the mandate of   participating in international negotiations and assisting the President on   international policymaking. The MCT presides the Interministerial Commission on   Global Climate Change, whose mission is to articulate governmental action on   that matter. Therefore, this ministry is the main sectoral institution on   international climate change discussions. The MMA is entitled with the national   environmental policy and the preservation, conservation, and sustainable use of   ecosystems, biodiversity, and forests, and it is the vice-president of the   aforementioned Interministerial Commission on Global Climate Change. Another   political body on climate change, created in 2007, is the Interministerial Committee   on Climate Change, whose main attribution is elaborating and implementing the   National Climate Change Plan. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Differently from the Commission, the Committee is   presided by the Civil House of the Presidency, which shows that the topic has   shifted from a technical and scientific perspective to a strategic one   connected to development policies, therefore acquiring political relevance in   the presidential agenda. The Civil House of the Presidency has been more active   in the domestic sphere than in the international one, but its participation in   international negotiations is growing and it has been particularly important in   settling disputes among the three ministries involved. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The position of MRE and MCT can be described as   conservative. Those ministries consider that market mechanisms have inherent   uncertainties: it is hard to measure, report and verify emissions reductions,   and there are threats of fraud and corruption (Viola, personal communication,   2010). For those actors forest carbon should be a secondary option to reducing   domestic emissions due to lack of permanence and high transaction costs.   Offsets should not be allowed as they threaten the environmental integrity of   the regime, allowing continuous growth of emissions in Annex I countries. The   MRE sees itself as a mediator of conflicts between sectoral ministries. The   Civil House of the Presidency will arbitrate those conflicts whenever   differences cannot be resolved (Ambassador Luiz Alberto Figueiredo Machado,   personal communication, 2010). The MCT was the most influential sectoral   institution until 2011 not only because of its legal mandate, but because its   position converges with the rationale of the MRE, despite the allegedly neutral   standing of the latter. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The MMA is a more recent actor in international   discussions on climate change and forests, despite its mandate to build the   national forest policy. This is a reflection of the previous mindset that   forests were to be maintained as a national issue that should be protected from   international saying. According to a representative (personal communication,   2010), in the UNFCCC the issue has evolved from a formal treatment under the   mitigation package to a broader space that acknowledges its specificities, such   as the impact of mitigation mechanisms on forest governance. In this context   the MMA aims at integrating mitigation strategies to national forest   governance. The MMA is open to the possibility of a mechanism that includes   both deforestation and carbon stocks. In the case of conservation, the MMA   agrees that methodological developments are needed to estimate and verify its   impact on climate change mitigation. Since 2009 the MMA has defended that   Brazil should participate on REDD+ international governance due to its   influence and negotiating capacity to guarantee the environmental integrity of   the system (Tha&iacute;s Juvenal, personal communication, 2010). For the MMA the   possibility of forest offsets to compensate fossil fuel emissions is "complex,"   which signals a more progressive view than "unacceptable." </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The role of the MMA as a relevant actor in forest and   climate negotiations is recent and its emergence is acknowledged by MRE and   MCT. However, such emergence in the domestic game of the Brazilian position is   neither simple nor pacific. Some tense moments of negotiation took place, such   as the construction of the 2006 Brazilian proposal of positive incentives to   reduce deforestation. The proposal required internal discussions at the MMA,   meetings with civil society representatives, and discussions with the MCT and   MRE. The MMA was successful in accommodating its counterparts' demands of a   mechanism that was not connected to carbon markets. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The MMA has always been present in UNFCCC discussions   in the Brazilian delegation, but not with high-level representatives until   2003, and not with a focus on forests until then. On COP-9, in 2003, the MMA   was represented by its Executive Secretary, who has the status of   Vice-Minister. In COPs 10, 11, 12 and 13, Minister Marina Silva was present and   even led the Brazilian delegation in specific moments. This shows a shift in   the perception of climate change by that institution. In 2006, the preliminary   version of the Brazilian proposal was presented by the Secretary of Forests and   Biodiversity of the MMA at a workshop in Nairobi. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Something that contributed to the MMA's qualified   insertion in the international climate change agenda was the transformation of   its Secretariat for Environmental Quality into a Secretariat for Environmental   Quality and Climate Change in 2007. For the first time that Ministry had a   specific institutional locus with the attribution of coordinating its actions   connected to climate change and proposing policies and economic instruments to   regulate the CDM. Within the Secretariat, a Climate Change Department was   created with the mandate to participate and advise the Ministry in   international negotiations on climate change. The first Secretary of   Environmental Quality and Climate Change was Thelma Krug, who came from the   MCT, a historical member of the Brazilian delegation and leading forest   negotiator since 2000. This move by the MMA demonstrates its willingness to   occupy a privileged space in UNFCCC discussions. </font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Governance over deforestation and strategic domestic   developments </font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Brazilian position of veto to the inclusion of   forests in the climate change regime from 1997 to 2006 aimed at pushing away   international scrutiny due to the high deforestation rates from 1995 to 2003.   In 2003 Minister Marina Silva defined strategic directions for the MMA that   involved promoting sustainable development, social participation and control,   strengthening the environmental national system and "transversality," or the   involvement of the different sectors of government in solving environmental   problems (MMA 2006). This last direction was decisive for controlling   deforestation as this became a government policy under which various ministries   and the Civil House of the Presidency had roles and responsibilities. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Still in 2003 the MMA successfully proposed the creation   of a Permanent Interministerial Working Group formed by 14 ministries with the   aim to propose and coordinate measures to reduce deforestation rates in the   Amazon. In 2004 this Working Group submitted to the President the Action Plan   for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon &#150; <i>Plano de A&ccedil;&atilde;o para Preven&ccedil;&atilde;o e     Controle do Desmatamento na Amaz&ocirc;nia</i> (PPCDAM). This plan was crucial   in the significant drop of deforestation from 2005 to 2012. It can be affirmed   that this plan has established the political foundations for Brazil to adopt   its voluntary targets in 2009. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The plan is divided in three axes: land tenure and   territorial ordering; monitoring and   surveillance; and fostering sustainable economic activities. A recent evaluation   conducted by the German Agency for International Cooperation &#150; <i>Deutsche Gesellschaft f&uuml;r     Internationale Zusammenarbeit</i> (GIZ) &#150;, the Economic Commission for   Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), and the Brazilian Institute for   Economic Applied Research &#150; <i>Instituto     de Pesquisa Econ&ocirc;mica Aplicada</i> (IPEA) &#150; pointed monitoring and   surveillance as the most effective strategy that contributed so far to the   success of the plan, although under the land tenure and territorial ordering   the creation of protected areas was also very relevant. The sustainable   economic activities were presented in that evaluation as the most prominent   need for political and financial investments.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In August 2008 a strategy that definitely contributed   to position Brazil as a proponent on the forests issue in the UNFCCC was the   creation of the Amazon Fund, with strong action by the MMA and civil society.   The fund is the pioneer national payment-for-performance scheme for reduction   of deforestation. The Brazilian Development Bank &#150; <i>Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ&ocirc;mico e Social</i> (BNDES) &#150; is the managing institution. The Fund has a Scientific Committee that   certifies the emissions reductions and an Orienting Committee that defines   criteria for investments, with representatives from various ministries, states,   civil society, academia, and indigenous peoples. The choice of a national   institution (BNDES) over traditional international finance institutions such as   the World Bank or the Global Environmental Fund (GEF) is another indicator of   the search for protagonism in the forest agenda. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An innovative and simple mechanism was designed to   determine the amounts that can be received each year. The fund uses the 10-year   average deforestation rate as its baseline. Each year the deforestation rate is   compared to that average, and emissions below that baseline will indicate how   much money the fund can invest. The baseline is reviewed every five years, so   from 2011 to 2015 yearly deforestation rates will be compared to the average   from 2001 to 2010 (MMA 2008). The resources in the fund are donations that do   not generate marketable carbon credits. The price established for each CO<sub>2</sub> ton reduced is US$ 5. So far the donors are Norway   (US$ 94 million), Germany (US$ 4 million), and Petrobr&aacute;s   (US$ 4 million). By July 2012, the Fund had already approved 32   projects out of 89, committing around US$ 145 million (Amazon Fund   2012).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Amazon Fund is relevant as it materializes the   kind of mechanism Brazil proposed in 2006 in the domestic level. As such, the   initiative is independent from REDD+ discussions in the UNFCCC, but strengthens   Brazilian soft power on discussions since it is a pioneering REDD+ practical   experience with an efficient and clear strategy, backed by a sound monitoring   system. The partnership with Norway is strategic, since the country is the   biggest donor for REDD+ and therefore a crucial player on the design of REDD+   strategies. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2008 Brazil also launched its National Climate   Change Plan at COP-14 in Poznan. This plan includes specific commitments   related to forests: reducing deforestation in 80% by 2020 and eliminating net   forest loss by 2015 by incrementing the area of planted forests from   5.5 million hectares to 11 million hectares, out of which   2 million hectares from native forests. This plan is an important landmark   as it is the first time Brazil takes on quantified emission reduction   commitments of reducing deforestation, even though they are voluntary. Those   voluntary targets were officially communicated to the UNFCCC in February 2010   through a letter to the Copenhagen Accord.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Governance over deforestation was effectively used as   a power resource by the MMA in the internal negotiations that took place in   2009 and culminated in quantified voluntary commitments to be announced in   Copenhagen by President Lu&iacute;s In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva. The former Minister of the   Environment, Carlos Minc, had an important role of strengthening and   consolidating the previous achievements of former Minister Marina Silva. Her   resignation opened a unique opportunity for the MMA to negotiate with the   President a new stance on climate change issues that created the favorable   circumstances for launching both the National Plan on Climate Change and the   voluntary targets. By then the media also started to announce the presidential   candidacy of Marina Silva, which was also a decisive factor for the government   to reaffirm its commitment to the environmental agenda. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Abranches (2010) notices, taking on such   commitments was not an easy decision. The MRE was against them, as was also the   Civil House Minister, Dilma Rousseff. The MCT was divided, with the National   Institute for Space Research and its scientists supporting them and the Climate   Change Coordination against them. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and   Food Supply &#150; <i>Minist&eacute;rio     da Agricultura, Pecu&aacute;ria e Abastecimento</i> (MAPA) &#150; supported the   commitments, which was a surprise. After four meetings the MMA was able to   convince the President that Brazil would be isolated in Copenhagen with its   outdated position and that it was the time for the country to lead. In December   the targets were announced and the traditional Brazilian position of denying   any quantified commitments was abandoned. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The MMA made an important movement to present an   estimate of GHG emissions by economy sectors in October 2009. Brazil presented   its first National Communication in 2002 with 1994 data, and the second would   only be presented in 2010. The MCT declared that those were not official   numbers (Abranches 2010). That forced it to review its strategy of taking as   much time as possible to submit its second National Communication to the   UNFCCC, so the Ministry presented official numbers in a preliminary document to   serve as a basis for the definition of the voluntary commitments. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the calculations that led to the numbers   36.1% to 38.9% from business-as-usual by 2020 have problems, as points   Abranches (2010), Brazil demonstrated its political weight in the climate   change regime. The drop in deforestation rates created the conditions for the   country to adopt a proactive position that includes the willingness to transfer   technologies, experience, and strategies with other tropical forest countries.   This position is coherent with one of the big goals of Brazil in external   relations: becoming a South leadership.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But Brazil still resists market mechanisms at the   international level, which some internal as well as international actors   perceive as opportunities. Therefore, the Brazilian leadership on the climate   change regime has not yet been fully accomplished. The fundamental requirement   for becoming a leader is being supported by others with similar views and this   has not happened in the case of Brazil and the issue of forests, although the   country has great influence in negotiations. And more than international   support, Brazil needs to build internal consensus on forests and the national   interest among domestic stakeholders. This has always been a complex and   challenging task.</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The growing involvement of non-traditional actors in   international policy</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Presidential Diplomacy, or the involvement of the   President in international matters, is not something new in Brazil. It has been   increasing since the 1980s, after the external debt crisis. Since then there is   growing pressure for the integration of developing countries to the   international dynamics. The first president to adopt this tendency was Fernando   Collor de Mello (1990&#150;1992). After him both Fernando Henrique Cardoso   (1995&#150;2002) and Lu&iacute;s In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva (2003&#150;2010) have made a strategic   investment in communicating the change in the Brazilian economic model of   substituting imports to an exporting economy and demonstrating Brazil's   engagement to the global context of a market economy (Cason and Powers, 2009).   Specially in the government Lu&iacute;s In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, such investment has not   been restricted solely to economic aspects, but also to the social agenda (Lima   and Hirst 2005).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the case of climate change, the influence of the   President has become more intense in 2009. It was a presidential decision that   created the Amazon Governors' Task Force and it was also the President who   decided that the voluntary commitments would be announced in Copenhagen and   inscribed in a law. Those achievements reflect a rare but crucial moment in   which the MMA had more influence over the President than the MCT and MRE.   However, factors other than simple political will can explain such influence.   In 2009, speculations that Marina Silva would be a candidate for the   presidential elections in 2010 brought environmental issues to a new level in   the domestic agenda and also political platforms of candidates such as Dilma   Rousseff, who was the Civil House Minister and also President Lula's party   candidate. Copenhagen presented a great opportunity for the Brazilian government   to reaffirm its commitment to the environmental agenda. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The involvement of civil society is also very relevant   and has been the object of further study in Brazil. Since 2001 some   organizations, namely Socio-Environmental Institute &#150; <i>Instituto Socioambiental</i> (ISA) &#150;, Institute for Amazon Research &#150; Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da   Amaz&ocirc;nia (IPAM) &#150;, and its international counterpart Environmental Defense Fund   (EDF) started advocating for the inclusion of standing forests in the climate   change regime in side events as well as publishing scientific articles that   demonstrated the contribution of deforestation to climate change. In 2003 ISA   and IPAM presented a proposal of international compensation for reducing   deforestation to Minister Marina Silva which remained unanswered. In COP-9   (Milan, 2003) those NGOs organized a side event in which both the MMA (then   represented by its Executive Secretary Cl&aacute;udio Langone) and Greenpeace, one of   the most influential NGOs in UNFCCC and with a strong anti-market position,   were invited to share their views on the proposal. In 2004 there was a meeting   in the MRE when representatives communicated that the government was willing to   discuss the civil society proposal (M&aacute;rcio Santilli, personal communication,   2010). In 2005 an updated version of the civil society proposal was presented,   then called Compensated Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation (IPAM and EDF   2005). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rationale of the civil society proposal was that   countries that opted for reducing national emissions from deforestation in a   commitment period of five years, from a historical baseline measured by   satellite monitoring, would be entitled to carbon credits similar to CDM   certified emission reductions. Once compensated, those countries would maintain   or deepen such commitments since Annex I countries fulfilled their obligations.   Some of the proposed elements were incorporated in the 2006 Brazilian proposal   and the Amazon Fund, such as the historical baseline and the periodic renewal   of reduction of deforestation commitments. The market component was not   incorporated as it was against one of the traditional pillars of the Brazilian   position: maintaining the environmental integrity of the regime. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other relevant initiative from civil society that   influenced the Brazilian government was the National Pact for Valuing Forests   and Ending Deforestation, proposed by nine NGOs<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> in October 2007 with the aim of   establishing a commitment among various sectors to end deforestation in seven   years. This proposal was considered radical by some sectors because it   encompassed even the deforestation allowed by Brazilian legislation. This pact   has become the basis for a discussion with BNDES on how to capture private,   domestic and international resources to fund the mechanism proposed. This   initiative has gathered international support, mainly by Norwegian NGOs that   were already discussing the support of the Norwegian government towards efforts   of tropical countries to reduce emissions from deforestation. Those discussions   were the embryo of the Norwegian commitment of donating US$ 1 billion   over seven years to the Amazon Fund (Ramos 2009). As envisaged by NGOs, BNDES   was designated as the manager of the Fund, whose thematic priorities are   similar to the ones in the Pact proposal. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another interesting development in 2009 is the   formation of a coalition by the Amazon State Governors to propose   recommendations to the Brazilian position for Copenhagen. They also proposed   the creation of a specific agency connected to the Presidency to design a   national system of emissions reductions (For&ccedil;a Tarefa sobre REDD e Mudan&ccedil;as   Clim&aacute;ticas 2009). Although its demands were not fully accepted for being too   market-oriented, the movement by the Governors brought part of their views to   the Brazilian position, achieving a commitment that market mechanisms would be   accepted if stronger targets were adopted by Annex I countries. It is   interesting to note that the report was finished in November 2009, when it was   already expected that no targets would come out of Copenhagen. The involvement   of subnational governments in international policymaking is still minor in   Brazil, although it has been growing mostly in environmental matters.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Private sector coalitions, although very general and   punctual, also influenced the Brazilian position as they showed the willingness   of a strong sector to internalize climate change in decision-making and   investments. Viola (2010) has analyzed three business coalitions formed between   June and September 2009 to influence the Brazilian position for Copenhagen and   all of them demanded the inclusion of REDD+ offsets in carbon markets. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusions</b></font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The international climate   change regime is presently the most relevant locus for international forest   policy discussions </font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As demonstrated, the issue of international protection   of forests is a controversial matter of international relations. Although the   need for conservation of those ecosystems is virtually acknowledged,   multilateralism has not been able to generate a regime that establishes   principles and standards for cooperation towards that end.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides important achievements, deforestation is still   a threat to environmental services at the local, regional, national, and global   levels. Most existing instruments on forests are non-binding and are products   of discussions that lack both objectivity and mandate to deal with the causes   of deforestation. It is clear that countries resist to tackle deforestation at   the level of international cooperation; however, due to the growing interest of   society in this matter, countries need to demonstrate their willingness to   reverse the global loss of forest cover, so they stay engaged in processes and   institutions such as the UNFF. Voluntary agreements and hollow institution used   to be the preferred options for general forest discussions. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The article also explained how the international   debate on forests has been changing since Eco-92 from a legal perspective that   focused on sovereignty over natural resources to an economic perspective   focused on the environmental services that forests provide. Since 1995, when   the first COP of the UNFCCC took place, one of these services &#150; carbon   retention &#150; has received more attention from the international community due to   its economic value and the possibility of its insertion in a market system.   During the discussions to establish the rules of the Kyoto Protocol, some Latin   American countries formed a coalition that aimed at including native forests in   the CDM based on their contribution to biodiversity conservation. This   legitimate environmental demand is connected to expectations of finance flows.   Such expectations of new and additional resources to traditional Official   Development Assistance (ODA) found new momentum in REDD+ discussions and   explain why the climate change regime has emerged as the most relevant forum   for international discussions on forests. It is a complex and delicate   situation, since the issue of forests encompasses broader political demands   than payment for services of carbon retention. Those demands, the expectations   on finance, and the political priority of forest discussions brought other   stakeholders to the climate change convention, such as Brazilian and international   NGOs connected to the forest agenda and indigenous peoples and local   communities.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tropical deforestation represents about 17% of total   global GHG emissions (IPCC 2007), which is significant. However, the   overestimated potential of this solution and the underestimated importance   given by some countries to domestic GHG reductions reflect broader conflicts   within the climate change regime. Inserting native forests on the climate   change regime is much more than just adopting mitigation actions. There are political,   social and environmental consequences that are far from simple and easy.   Regimes should function as living organisms in constant evolution, adapting to   stimuli constantly presented by society. The outcome of those discussions will   define new paths for international forest policy. It cannot be expected that   the climate change regime will solve all issues at stake in the forest   quasi-regime, but it should respond to demands in its sphere of competence.</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In international   discussions on forests and climate change from 1997     to 2012, the Brazilian position has evolved from veto to proposition</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The article mapped the evolution of the Brazilian   position, which had a turning point in 2006. It is important to highlight that   the transition is not yet completed and that some dissonance remains between   the willingness to take on commitments, their domestic implementation, the real   benefits to the Brazilian society, and the diverging reactions from different   government agencies. Brazil has been influential at the international level,   but its 2006 proposal to the UNFCCC has not become the preferred one among   tropical forest countries. It can be concluded that such evolution of the   Brazilian position is a first step to a leadership position on forests that   depends on the effective solution of the issues pointed out above. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As discussed, the landmark of the evolution of the   Brazilian position is the 2006 proposal to the UNFCCC of a global fund for   positive incentives for reducing deforestation. The construction of such proposal   is extremely interesting for various reasons. The first one is the determinant   influence of civil society, which in 2003 presented to the world a view that   was different from the "official" one. This caused the Brazilian federal   government to try to accommodate that view &#150; mostly the MRE, traditionally   protected by its legal competence to define the national interest in   international negotiations. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other bodies responsible for forming the Brazilian   position reacted differently at the stimulus from civil society. The MMA, whose   competence is to formulate the national policy on forests, acknowledged the   specificities of the issue and keeps pursuing the integration of mitigation   mechanisms and domestic governance over deforestation. During 2008 both MCT and   MRE kept the position that REDD+ was part of the broader mitigation package and   not something to be discussed separately from other issues. The interest of the   MMA in discussing specific details of REDD+, such as benefit-sharing, can be   explained by its proximity to other stakeholders such as civil society, state   governments, and forest peoples, which is not the case of the other ministries   involved. It is important to mention that the MRE and MCT have been   close-following all REDD+ negotiations with MMA, but with a much more cautious   perspective. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although various NGOs and government representatives   do agree that the Brazilian position has evolved; some point out that the core   of that position, which is the preoccupation with the environmental integrity   of the mitigation system of the UNFCCC, has not changed. The non-acceptance of   offsetting or compensating fossil fuel emissions with the maintenance or   enhancement of standing forests remains as the most controversial point of view   of that position. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For M&aacute;rcio Santilli (personal communication, 2010),   the change is very small. There is a political result compared to the defensive   position of 1997, but the resources the country could have received for forest   protection were never received. "Nobody is paying that bill." Some   international discussions on the issue of compensation through carbon markets   took place within the Amazon Governors Task Force in 2009 and the synthesis   report from this group mentions no ideological objection for the inclusion of REDD+   as a market mechanism. However, that inclusion was connected with the   achievement of broader commitments by developed countries, so it was never   presented internationally. State governments within the Amazon keep involved in   discussions and agreements with other regional initiatives, such as the   California system.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no doubt that since 2006 Brazil has gained   political weight in climate change and forests negotiations. The country's   position is backed by a legal and institutional framework that has been   designed since 2008 with the Amazon Fund and the National Climate Change Plan,   and in 2009 with the launching of the voluntary quantified emission reduction   commitments inscribed in a national law. Those relevant achievements allow   Brazil to share lessons, knowledge and experiences with other countries and   somehow influence the Coalition for Rainforest Nations and other G-77 and China   countries. However, the lack of consensus regarding market mechanisms remains   as a challenge for Brazilian leadership in negotiations. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the 2009 law strongly emphasizes the   voluntary nature of the Brazilian commitments, the new standing of Brazil on   forests and climate change is a victory of Brazilian society. Climate change   has become a relevant political issue, although still minor, in the electoral   dynamics of 2010. At some point the international negotiating position, still   close to China and India with a focus on the historical responsibility of   developing countries and the absolute need for transfer of financial resources,   will change to reflect the national political developments as wants most part   of the Brazilian society. The involvement of various sectors in the discussions   regarding the recent reform of the Forest Code and the campaign for the President   to veto what could mean more deforestation is a clear example of the importance   of the issue of forests in the national political agenda. This     will eventually be reflected internationally. Brazil has gone a long way. What   is needed now is implementing this sophisticated framework, next phase to be   completed for the country to get closer to international leadership on climate   change negotiations. </font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the transition from veto to proposition of alternatives   on international climate change and forests negotiations, Brazil has been using   its forests as soft power resources</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The shift in the Brazilian position is somehow a   response to international circumstances since 2003, when efforts from various   actors to include native forests in the international climate change regime   started. But the domestic context was the determinant factor, as demonstrated.   Since 2005 a mosaic of variables has been creating a favorable environment for   Brazil to use forests as soft power resources instead of viewing them as a   burden. Again, the transition is not completed although it is unlikely that it   will be reversed. Those domestic variables are governance over deforestation;   the growing participation of the Presidency on climate change policy both   internationally and domestically; the emergence of the MMA as a relevant actor   in climate change discussions; and the growing interest of domestic actors not   traditionally connected to international environmental negotiations, such as   Amazon governors and the private sector, which effectively brought their views   to the table. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the picture drawn above, two variables clearly   demonstrate the use of forests as soft power resources. The first is governance   over deforestation. The positive results achieved by PPCDAM, coupled with   market factors such as price changes and the growing demand for environmental   compliance of productive chains, have made Brazil successfully deal with its   major vulnerability on international forests discussions: the alarming rates of   deforestation in the Amazon. Of the strategies in PPCDAM, one deserves special   mention: improvement of satellite monitoring. All information is now publicized   on the internet, which is a major development in terms of transparency. Brazil   has become a global reference due to its satellite monitoring systems and this   knowledge is gradually becoming an important area of south-south cooperation.   This is a clear demonstration of Brazil using forests as soft power resources. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second variable is the emergence of the MMA as a   relevant actor in climate change discussions due to the reversal in the high   deforestation rates. In 2003 this reduction was defined as a priority by   Minister Marina Silva, who successfully involved other ministries with agendas   not directly connected to environmental protection but whose sectoral agendas   deal with deforestation drivers such as agriculture and livestock, public   finance, infrastructure, etc. The Ministry of the Environment was able to build   domestic strategic alliances, for example, with the National Institute for   Space Research and BNDES, and achieved a victory on something that Brazil was   ashamed of before international society. Marina Silva's resignation opened a   strategic political window for the launching of previously agreed instruments:   the Amazon Fund, the National Plan, and the National Policy on Climate Change.   Although the Plan is heavily criticized for being a collection of actions   already defined and budgeted for, this instrument for the first time defined a   target for reducing deforestation, which is a historical achievement for the   country. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It should be highlighted that forests are more than   carbon sinks: they harbor a significant share of the world's biodiversity; they   are home to forest peoples and have a fundamental role in water cycles and   protection of soils. A strictu sensu market mechanism that will treat forest   carbon as any commodity and will seek maximizing profits and minimizing costs   will not be able to contribute to reversing neither global climate change nor   the destruction of forests if those specificities are not considered. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Forests are part of the   problem and part of the solution for global climate change. Brazil, the biggest   tropical forest country, has demonstrated its capacity to use forests as soft   power resource in the climate change regime. This achievement is a valuable   learning for its action in other environmental forums and agendas, which should   be object of continuous improvement.</font></p>     ]]></body>

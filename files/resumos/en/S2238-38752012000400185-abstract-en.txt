Abstract: This paper aims to follow the process of circulation and appropriation of ideas about the corporatist model of organization of state and society in Brazil in the years 1930/40. To do so, we will use the intellectual production of Azevedo Amaral, who - besides translating for Portuguese the book The century of corporatism by Michael Manoilesco - wrote many others important works, like O Estado autorit√°rio e a realidade nacional, in which he theorized about the application of these ideas in Brazil.

ABSTRACT The aim of this article is to understand Brazilian democracy by analyzing its pendulum movements. We will approach the institutional organization of both democratic and counter democratic political structures in Brazil. My argument is that Brazilian democracy allows broad non electoral or counter electoral roads to power that are used from time to time.

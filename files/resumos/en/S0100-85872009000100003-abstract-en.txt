This article describes and analyzes a typical practice of Argentine devout groups of Sai Baba, known as Meditation on the Light. We characterize that as a ritual performance in which we find symbolic representations around the corporality, we call it corporal geography. We examine how the ritual efficacy is formed in this practice and argue that this performance is effective because contribute in the person modification to the success of this priority spiritual objective, (the fusion with God), at this point we contrast this kind of meditation with the classics Cartesians Metaphysics Meditations. Finally we bring into relief the inclusion of the corporal-Performatic dimension in the analysis of the religious phenomenon.

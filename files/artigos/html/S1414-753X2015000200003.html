<p class="sec"><a name="abstract">ABSTRACT</a></p>
<p>The aims of this article is to reflect on the contradictions between a conception of
               development that is anchored in the idea of progress, industrialization and economic
               growth and worldviews of indigenous peoples, for whom the existing symbiotic bond
               between man and nature necessarily involves intangibility and irreducibility of
               natural resources as a source of economic and social development. For this reason, it
               is argued that a proper view of development must include an epistemic shift in which
               the ideas and knowledge of indigenous communities are built to radically alter
               society/nature and highly predatory logic environment relationship and life human
               that comes currently prevail. This new perspective implies a change in the discourse
               and everyday practices of "knowing" and "doing" in what some authors have referred to
               as post-development.</p>

<p>O presente artigo pretende refletir a respeito das contradições existentes entre uma
               concepção do desenvolvimento que se encontra ancorada na ideia de progresso,
               industrialização e crescimento econômico e as cosmovisões dos povos originários, para
               os quais os laços simbióticos mantidos entre o homem e a natureza supõem
               necessariamente a intangibilidade e irredutibilidade dos recursos naturais como fonte
               de desenvolvimento econômico e social. Pelo mesmo, se sustenta que uma visão adequada
               do desenvolvimento tem que contemplar um giro epistémico no qual as conceições e
               saberes das comunidades indígenas sejam incorporados para alterar radicalmente a
               relação sociedade/natureza e a lógica altamente predatória do meio-ambiente e da vida
               humana que vem imperando até nossos dias. Esta nova perspectiva que implica uma
               mudança no discurso e nas práticas cotidianas do "saber" e do "fazer" é aquilo que
               alguns autores têm convencionado em denominar como
                  <em>pós-desenvolvimento</em>.</p>

<a name="idp47232"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The notion of development</p>
<p>The notion of development was incorporated into social theory in 1945, at the end of the
            Second World War as a way of responding to the challenges of reconstructing the
            countries that had been either directly or indirectly affected by the world war. Thus,
            the allied countries put forward a new world order in which the calamities that
            afflicted the planet during the first four decades of the 20th century would be purged
            from the face of the earth: war, totalitarianism, prejudice, racial discrimination,
            unemployment and poverty. Still during the war, in 1941, the allied forces drafted the
            Atlantic Charter which stated that signatory countries were committed to seeking ways
            for all the free inhabitants of the planet to enjoy better economic and social
            well-being. These objectives were re-affirmed in the founding Principles, the Charter of
            the United Nations, signed by 51 countries at the San Francisco Conference in June 1945.
            The UN Charter clearly sets out the objectives of economic and social development in one
            of its paragraphs which proclaims that the peoples of the United Nations are determined
            to promote progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, employ international
            organizations to promote the economic and social advancement of all peoples and achieve
            international cooperation in solving problems of an economic, social, cultural and
            humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and the
            fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion
               (<sup><a href="#B19">UNITED NATIONS, 2013</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, within the framework of the United Nations' activities, a Commission was
            formed to draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. <sup><a href="#B08">Stéphane Hessel (2011)</a></sup>, in his manifesto "<em>Time for
               Outrage!</em>", reminds us that one of the main objectives of the above
            Declaration is to enshrine the basic rights which would enable people to free themselves
            from the threats totalitarianism poses to society and move toward a future of
            development and civilized, harmonious coexistence between all the countries of the
            world. </p>
<p>Within this context, the issue of development was an essential component on the agenda
            to be drafted and implemented by the international organizations re-founded after the
            end of World War II. In Latin America, given the difficulties in obtaining external
            supplies during the war, concepts to overcome dependency on imported industrialized
            goods gained increasing importance among the region's economists and policy makers,
            particularly in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay. </p>
<p>This becomes more evident at the end of the 1940s when a group of experts at the
            Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC), under the leadership of Raúl Prebisch,
            drafted a set of recommendations to governments emphasizing the urgent need to set up
            robust import substitution industrialization programs - in particular those involving
            capital assets - and carry out vast infrastructure (roads, ports, railways, airports,
            water ways, telecommunications, dams, irrigation systems, hydro and/or thermal power
            plants, schools, hospitals and so on) investment plans. </p>
<p>When ECLAC was established in 1948, explicit references were made to the fact that, in
            addition to resolving the economic problems which resulted from the war, the "commission
            will dedicate itself to studying and seeking solutions to the problems caused to Latin
            America by the global economic imbalance" (<sup><a href="#B01">CEPAL,
               1969</a></sup>).<sup><a href="#fn01">i</a></sup> Solutions involving these
            propositions were mainly based on stimulating industrialization processes and economic
            growth. It is clear that this conception of development was strongly underpinned by a
            teleological vision which supposed that the idea of economic and social progress is
            associated to growth. Thus, most of ECLAC's researchers and economists adhered to
            evolutionist currents of thought which conceived social dynamics as a chain of
            progressive changes leading to a higher level of material, social and cultural
               well-being.<sup><a href="#fn02">ii</a></sup>
         </p>
<p>These concepts are closely associated to a fundamental current in the Latin American
            social thinking: the theory of modernization. Gino Germani and other modernization
            theorists follow an interpretation which sees the evolution-modernization of society as
            an institutionalization process of transformations and argue that societies always move
            from a traditional state - where agricultural and non-industrialized processes
            predominate - to a modern, urban and industrial society. This transformation comes about
            not only through changes in a society's scientific-technological structures and
            artefacts, but mainly through acquiring the values of modernity. That is, by adhering to
            concepts of progress and change which are ultimately expressed in the behavioural
            patterns which governs relationships in modern society.</p>
<p>This model reaches its peak and has a huge influence on ECLAC's thinkers, in particular
            through the work of José Medina Echevarría who, from an essentially sociological point
            of view, manages to associate this set of concepts with the notion of growth, with
            emphasis on topics such as economic stagnation, full employment and the role of the
            State in stimulating the private sector and in creating productive capacity for the
            countries of the region. Thus, modernization and growth are fused together into
            developmentist theories which explain the causes of Latin American underdevelopment
            based on a lack of public and private investment, the absence of endogenous
            technological development, and conservative and traditional practices and beliefs which
            continued to be held by a significant part of society.</p>
<p>Thus, at the heart of ECLAC's thinking we find, to a varying degree of emphasis
            (depending of the level of adherence to the theory), the notion that Latin America is,
            broadly speaking, underdeveloped and 'backwards' compared to industrialized countries.
            On this basis, a situation emerges where step-by-step or sequential advancement is
            possible, starting from underdevelopment to achieve full development and
            industrialization. This presupposes that for countries to develop they need to meet a
            number of structural (economic) and cultural requirements so that they can be considered
            to be moving toward a higher state, that is, a modern industrial society. Thus, it is
            possible to talk about developing countries, because, as well as setting out an
            evolutionary route to become a conceptually more superior society, this trajectory also
            presupposes that the stages necessary to reach development are the very same stages
            followed by developed countries.</p>
<p>This resulted in numerous policies which tended to increase the rationalization of
            public administration and also affect various aspects of social life, inculcating values
            and attitudes, and creating institutions and organizations in conformity with modernity,
            that is, worthy of developed societies. In this way, in both evolutionist and
            historical-dialectic versions, development and progress presuppose a change toward a
            higher end. That is, toward the improvement of the human condition. Both versions of
            development, with some alterations and additions, remain part of contemporary thinking
            and form the very epistemological foundations (which often remains latent and
            unquestioned) of economic, sociological and historical theories.</p>
<p>Just as the concept of development is inseparable from the modern discourse, it is also
            intimately associated to capitalism as the hegemonic means of production and all its
            various historical forms. In the so-called Third World, the problem of development
            emerges with the fall of colonialism and the gradual process of the consolidation of
            independent Nation-States. However, new States have remained linked to their old
            Metropolises through international trade. Therefore, the problem of development in the
            Third World takes the following form: how to transform productively and culturally
            backwards (underdeveloped) societies so they can catch up with those at a more advanced
            stage of development. The aim of transformations proposed by development theories is to
            enable Third World countries to successfully participate in the global capitalist
            dynamics. </p>
<p>Some countries were able to develop certain sectors or regions whilst keeping other
            areas underdeveloped. This is called structural dualism, that is, the simultaneous
            existence of dichotomous structures, often conceived as autonomous zones which are
            poorly connected, when not totally disconnected.<sup><a href="#fn03">iii</a></sup> Other analyses subsequently emerged which tended to complement and
            transform this point of view. In a version of the so-called dependency theory,
            underdevelopment is not conceived as a stage or period prior to development, but rather
            as part of a broader historical process. In this sense, as André Gunder Frank argues,
            underdevelopment and development are "two sides of the same coin" or part of the same
            universal historical process in which the roots of underdevelopment are found in the
            links between external dependency and the internal subordination of exploitation
            enclaves. In other words, both processes are simultaneous in historical terms and
            functionally linked. Here dualism, therefore, is only revealing the existence of two
            interacting worlds which mutually influence one another, permanently reproducing and
            fuelling the development of some (advanced industrialized states) and the
            underdevelopment of others (peripheral, backward and dependent states). Therefore,
            underdevelopment is not the direct outcome of a lack of capital, technological
            backwardness or the endurance of pre-modern values. Rather it is a concomitant condition
            of an unequal and combined dynamics created by capitalism (<sup><a href="#B16">LÖWY, 1998</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The logical consequence of this conception is that within each country, forms of
            structural dualism are more an expression of internal colonialism, where more developed
            areas have an ongoing relationship of effective domination - the extraction and
            exploitation of raw materials and the workforce - with <em>hinterland</em>
            regions which remained underdeveloped precisely because of this unequal type of
            relationship (<sup><a href="#B24">STAVENHAGEN, 1967</a></sup>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp87040"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The consequences of this development conception</p>
<p>Although, at the time, other theories emerged which dispute this conception - such as
            the dependency theory of unequal and combined development or internal colonialism - we
            argue that this notion of development persists to this day in that it is associated to
            the progress of nations through modernization, economic growth and a cultural model
            inspired by the West.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this notion of development is linked to a Eurocentric and linear narrative
            of human history, in particular a mode of construction of the modern world which
            establishes specific colonial/imperial power relations and is closely associated to a
            model of anthropocentric thinking whose basis is the so-called Judeo-Cristian "original
            myth". Within this conception, human beings have absolute power over nature. According
            to the Book of Genesis, after creating man and woman God commands: "Be fruitful and
            multiply, replenish the earth and have dominion over it". The first thing to consider is
            that this command is arrogant, in terms of subjecting not only nature, but also all
            human beings considered "weaker and less inclined to get involved in games of power and
            domination" (<sup><a href="#B17">MAX-NEEF, 1986, p. 43</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Second, this command refers to the schism between humanity and nature, a break away from
            what Fromm called the human-nature symbiosis. When God created man in his image and
            likeness, He raised him to a higher level than all other inhabitants of the planet. The
            supposition, therefore, implies that there are no limits to man's exploitation of his
            environment. The rational character of human beings and the rationalization of economic
            life present in Protestant asceticism have allowed the human mind to separate itself
            from the world of things and to place man at a higher plane, representing an ontological
            rupture. This rupture is the distinctive mark of the modernity project formulated by the
            enlightenment philosophers which eventually became the hegemonic narrative for
            understanding the fate of humanity in its entirety. In Edgardo Lander's words:</p>
<blockquote><p>"According to the European consciousness of modernity, these successive separations
               became intertwined with others which provided the basis for the essential contrast
               established - with the configuration of the colonial world - between Western and
               European man (conceived as modern and advanced) and the 'Others' - the rest of the
               world's cultures and peoples" (LANDER, 2005, p. 26).</p></blockquote>
<p>This foundational origin of modernity and capitalism are responsible for the type of
            relationship established between the "developed" world and nature and the so-called
            uncivilized or backward lands. It not only justifies a productivist model based on the
            supposition that resources are infinite, or endless, but also naturalizes various forms
            of dispossession, plundering and domination to which nature and indigenous communities
            or peoples inhabiting specific territories are subjected.</p>
<p>The current environmental crisis leads us precisely to question this epistemological
            perspective and its resulting model which provides the basis for the deeply-rooted
            belief in the supremacy of human beings over the rest of the species and nature - which
            human beings can exploit without restrictions. Thus, this environmental crisis
            represents, above all, a crisis in the Western way of thinking, a particular way of
            conceiving the world which divides the mind from the body and knowledge from the
            traditional, sacred and magical wisdom of the "primitive" peoples. It is precisely this
            knowledge, validated by science, which produced a fragmented and reified world through
            the control and domination of nature. The accumulated evidence of the last three decades
            provides compelling testimony of a phenomenon which has been revealed and discussed for
            many decades: the exhaustion of the productive and predatory model that increasingly
            threatens the material foundations of life on the planet. Indeed, given the successive
            environmental and "climate" catastrophes the planet has experienced since Chernobyl and
            the Fukushima plant tragedy, it is no exaggeration to argue that we are at an advanced
            stage of a structural crisis - a hazardous situation fabricated by man - affecting not
            only the capitalist system but the sustainability of our species. The 21st century began
            marked by catastrophes, an unprecedented number of ecological and natural disasters in
            the history of the world.<sup><a href="#fn04">iv</a></sup>
         </p>
<p>Nevertheless, notions of the ecological limits to economic growth and the
            inter-relations between development and the environment were reintroduced into Western
               thinking<sup><a href="#fn05">v</a></sup> in the 1960s and the beginning of the
            1970s by an important group of theorists, amongst whom Georgescu-Roegen, Kapp, Naess,
            Sachs and Schumacher. For example, in his pioneering work "Small is Beautiful", first
            published in 1973, the German-British economist, Ernst F. Schumacher, offers a
            resounding critique of the productive model prevalent in Western societies which could
            result in environmental degradation and the destruction of life itself. His objective
            was to understand the problem in its entirety and seek ways to develop new production
            methods and new consumer agendas in accordance with a life-style projected to be
            permanent and sustainable. Despite a difference in focus and the somewhat militant
            positions of each of these thinkers, they all have in common the fact that they
            vehemently criticize the production and consumption model inherent to capitalist
            development.</p>
<p>This model, which generated the exponential growth in the exploitation of natural
            resources and stimulated unbridled consumerism, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere
            countries, is responsible both for provoking the depletion of resources and producing
            tonnes of waste, causing water, air and earth pollution on a daily basis.<sup><a href="#fn06">vi</a></sup> Every year million hectares of woods and thousands
            of species are lost, irreversibly reducing and eroding biological diversity. Rainforests
            continue to be destroyed and the world loses approximately 17 million hectares,
            equivalent to the size of four Switzerlands. As there are not enough trees to absorb
            excess CO<sub>2</sub>, the greenhouse gas effect and global warming increase. Despite
            the Montreal Protocol, the ozone layer will not recover until the middle of the 21st
            century. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (370 parts per million) has increased by 32%
            since the 19th century, reaching the highest concentration levels in the last 20 million
            years. Today over 23,000 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> a year are released into the
            atmosphere, accelerating climate change. According to the forecasts, carbon dioxide
            emissions will have increased by 75% between 1997 and 2020. Every year we emit
            approximately 100 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide, 70 million tonnes of nitrogen oxide
            and 200 million tonnes of carbon monoxide, as well as 60 million tonnes of suspended
            particulates, aggravating the problems caused by acid rain, tropospheric ozone and local
            air pollution.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the set of environmental indicators studied in the last decades
            increasingly show that if humanity does not change its model of development, in less
            than a century the survival of the planet and the human species will be put at serious
            risk. <sup><a href="#B18">Mészáros (2011)</a></sup> reminds us that with each
            new phase of forced postponement, the contradictions of the capitalist system can only
            increase, bringing ever greater dangers to our own survival.</p>
<p>One of the greatest changes observed by scientists is climate change, a phenomenon we
            can no longer ignore. Although today it is undeniable, climate change has been occurring
            for a long time, systematically transforming the Earth. This is what is understood by
            Global Environmental Change, namely, changes taking place in the earth, atmosphere,
            ocean and biosphere systems which are considerably more extensive and complex than
            climate change. Together, Global Environmental Change and climate change form a
            destructive mix caused by a number of human activities (of anthropogenic origin)<sup><a href="#fn07">vii</a></sup> and dependent on various factors such as the size
            of the earth's population, its level of energy consumption, specific technological mixes
            and the predatory use of natural resources.</p>
<p>This constellation of factors have resulted in, amongst other things, the greenhouse gas
            effect and global warming, the thinning of the ozone layer, changes in biodiversity,
            desertification, acid rain and both underground and surface water pollution. Though
            almost all scientists agree about the reality of climate change, there is still
            considerable uncertainty about the actual consequences of this phenomenon. Scientific
            forecasts have improved over time and a recent study estimates that by 2100 10% of the
            planet will be affected by climate change.<sup><a href="#fn08">viii</a></sup> In
            Latin America it is expected that the major impacts of these changes will affect
            specifically agriculture, fishing and access to clean water. Peasant and indigenous
            communities, in particular, will be harmed, as well as small and medium-sized
            producers.</p>
<p>Therefore, one of the first considerations to be made regarding climate change is that
            it affects populations and countries unevenly, reproducing in this way pre-existing
            inequalities in other spheres of the economic, political and social reality. Indeed,
            studies carried out by ECLAC and the World Bank show that developing countries are more
            exposed to the negative consequences of climate change. It is expected that they will
            bear the brunt - between 75% and 80% - of the negative climatic effects: hurricanes,
            floods, droughts, desertification, increases in sea level, and changes in agricultural
            cycles and the rainfall pattern.</p>
<p>Another finding is that the accumulated effects of greenhouse gas emissions (GHE), one
            of the main causes of climate change, cannot be addressed exclusively through mitigation
            policies. The problem is even more serious: although a drastic and immediate reduction
            of greenhouse gas emissions is possible, it will not have a significant impact on the
            climate. Policies for adapting to these changes are now required. They include measures
            such as a more egalitarian and universal provision of drinking water, sanitation, food
            security, access to better health services and decent education.</p>
<p>This is precisely because, as we have previously pointed out - in addition to the
            existing vulnerabilities which affect the world's poor, these populations are also
            vulnerable to climate catastrophes. Their vulnerability is linked to inequality and
            exclusion which place certain social groups at greater risk than others. Furthermore,
            given that climate change impacts are unevenly spread, both extreme weather events and
            the gradual transformation of the environment disproportionately affect more vulnerable
            human groups living in rural or urban poverty, indigenous people, the elderly, women,
            children and the sick. These social sectors are subjected to a "double exposure", that
            is, to the disastrous effects of climate change and a constellation of problems
            associated to their precarious condition, understood as the result of socio-economic
            deficits or needs (<sup><a href="#B13">LAMPIS, 2013</a></sup>).</p>
<p>We can, therefore, conclude that climate change is not only linked to the behaviour
            pattern of nature, but is essentially based on the close interrelations between
            environmental dynamics and social processes. Thus, it is essential to consider the
            connection between the changing state of the ecosystems with the development model
            implemented by the governments of Latin America, both in history and now. Within this
            context, the impact climate change will have in the continent and adaptation efforts to
            overcome the disastrous consequences of global warming, as well as water and soil
            pollution are a concern and represent a challenge, not only in terms of democratizing
            the use of resources, but also in terms of a response to guarantee the conditions for
            the survival of the region's inhabitants. Ensuring that ecosystems and communities who
            live therein can overcome the damaging effects of extreme weather events (environmental
            resilience) is also a challenge.</p>

<a name="idp124624"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Socio-environmental conflicts</p>
<p>Social-environmental conflicts can be defined as disputes involving the use, access and
            ownership of natural resources and environmental services by groups of actors who have
            different power and interests, and defend different conceptions regarding the management
            of public goods. As can be observed, in this definition the material aspects of these
            resources are emphasized. Other conceptions show that even when conflicts between groups
            and actors are originally based on material and tangible aspects, they also involve
            different discourses in terms of the values and meanings these actors attribute to
            resources within a particular ecological context.</p>
<p>Therefore, environmental conflicts can be due to the purposes different actors and
            economic agents (individuals or companies) assign to land use and natural resources. One
            the one hand, they are sustained by the cultural value systems which different societies
            or communities have built around particular resources and, on the other, the different
            uses these resources acquire due to multiple productive activities. This values are
            based on a particular construction of modernity which values Western scientific
            knowledge above all other types of knowledge and understands progress as an essential
            mark based on the idea of growth and the exploitation of human and natural resources. It
            is clear, therefore, as pointed out earlier, that this notion is founded upon an
            ontology and epistemology which became the civilization model for the entire human race. </p>
<p>In order to elucidate this situation a number of organizations and study centres have
            mapped numerous cases of conflicts between indigenous populations, transnational
            companies and/or governments.<sup><a href="#fn09">ix</a></sup> Nevertheless, two
            of these conflicts seem particularly emblematic, considering that they occur in
            countries described as progressive and which have policies differentiated by region with
            regard to indigenous populations. These are the cases of Bolivia and Peru, countries
            governed by presidents who descend from the indigenous populations of their own
            countries: Evo Morales Ayma of <em>Aymara</em> descent and Ollanta Humala who is
            a descendent of the <em>Incas</em>. Both cases are expounded below.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="idp132480"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">3.1. Bolivia. The TIPNIS Case</p>
<p>The Plurinational State of Bolivia was officially instituted on 9th February 2009, when
            the new "Plurinational" Constitution was promulgated during Bolivia's re-founding
            process. The Constitution enshrines 35 nationalities as forming the Bolivian Nation. </p>
<p>When Morales reassumed as President, he devolved all the old Republican symbols to the
            Legislative Assembly and substituted them by others representing the new Plurinational
            State and the multi-coloured indigenous flag <em>Wiphala</em> was raised
            alongside the national flag. Meanwhile, Morales announced that the enforcement of the
            new State was essentially a movement of the people which re-founded the Bolivian
            homeland.</p>
<p>The Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South American (IIRSA)
            is a forum aiming to promote common policies in the areas of transport, infrastructure,
            energy and communication in order to support the regional integration process. One of
            IIRSA's main projects is the building of a transoceanic road to serve as a production
            corridor, increasing the efficient flow of international trade and exports. This road
            crosses the Bolivian territory from Puerto Suarez in the border with Mato Grosso do Sul
            (Corumbá, Brazil) to the Chilean border. It has kept to its original trajectory in
            Bolivia integrating the departments of Cochabamba in the centre of the country with the
            eastern region of Beni. The Bolivian government argues that Beni is a region with high
            agro-industrial potential. However, it has remained outside the developing axis and
            dependent on the department of Santa Cruz, an important industrial development zone and
            a significant stronghold for the opposition against President Morales' administration
               (<sup><a href="#B21">RIVERO, 2011</a></sup>).</p>
<p>One of the main arguments in favour of the Initiative for the Integration of Regional
            Infrastructure in South American IIRSA project is that, historically, the regions of
            Beni and Pando have been isolated from the rest of the country and that this road would
            enable both provinces and the North of Bolivia to have better access to important cities
            such as Cochabamba and La Paz. "Bolivia and Beni need roads to attain economic and
            social development and these roads must be built through areas which are economically
            viable and bring greater social benefits." Therefore, the Bolivian government project
            aims to integrate a sector of the territory which, according to the assessment of
            authorities, has so far been excluded from the progress experienced by the rest of the
            country. In this spirit, the vice-president of Bolivia, Álvaro García Linera, stated in
            an interview, that "our fellow citizens are extremely right to be concerned about the
            future of the forest, but it is equally legitimate to ask for a road to link different
            regions". He afterwards suggested that the indigenous demonstrations were instigated by
            the right in order to destabilize the government in an attempt to restore the
            conservatives to power. </p>
<p>However, the conflicts which emerged with the project have many facets. The first
            problem observed, relates to the road's projected trajectory which cuts, or literally
            divides in half, the Isiboro Sécure Indigenous Territory and National Park (TIPNIS), a
            12,000 km² environmental reserve, very rich in biodiversity. The park is home to four
            indigenous ethnicities who have ownership of this territory through a constitutional
            mandate. They are the Mojeños, Yuracarés, Chimanes and Trinitarios. The 306-kilometre
            stretch between Villa Tunari (Cochabamba) and San Ignacio de Moxos (Beni) cuts across
            TIPNIS, affecting the livelihood of over 50,000 people who are members of the four
            ethnicities settled in the region. This means the destruction of an area which is doubly
            protected by the Constitution - as a national park and an indigenous territory - and has
            a direct impact on the daily lives of the local communities. Furthermore, there is
            opposition to activities causing irreversible damage to the natural biodiversity and the
            environment. In particular the activities of logging and oil groups who are interested
            in accessing the park's resources (<sup><a href="#B15">LEÓN y ARZE,
               2013</a></sup>).</p>
<p>In addition to these objections, local communities have denounced the lack of
            consultation on the part of the authorities regarding road building activities, in
            compliance with the ILO resolution 169 which determines that indigenous communities
            living in territories where any type of venture or project is to take place must be
            consulted by the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>It is precisely due to this situation that, from the beginning, the organizations of
            which these indigenous nations are members have expressed their opposition to the
            planned route by holding various types of demonstrations such as marches, occupations,
            road blocks and vigils. The moment of greatest tension occurred when the Bolivian
            Foreign Minister, David Choquehuanca, decided to meet the protesters who intended to
            march to La Paz and found themselves blocked by peasant-settlers of a different
            ethnicity, with the support of the police.<sup><a href="#fn10">x</a></sup> Forced
            by a group of women to head a front line column to break the military barricade, the
            Foreign Minister was "rescued" by the police. Violent confrontation ensued and many
            protesters were hurt, including women and children. After this incident, the Defence
            Minister announced his irrevocable resignation and forced president Morales to suspend
            the road project. Morales also announced that a draft bill would be send to the
            Plurinational Legislative Assembly, making the TIPNIS territory "inviolable". "This is
            governing by obeying the people", remarked Morales when he announced the measure.</p>
<p>In addition, the Bolivian president declared that the suspension of the road project
            would be maintained until the TIPNIS communities were consulted on this matter. An ad
            hoc Commission was formed which included representatives of the Catholic Church and the
            Human Rights Commission. These institutions must produce a report based on a
            consultation involving all 64 communities living in the indigenous territory, containing
            information on the positive or negative response of the population toward the road
            project, as well as information on whether the regulation on Protected Areas was
            applied.</p>
<p>Within this context, the Commission's starting point is the pre-existing definition
            included in the Plurinational State of Bolivia Constitution in one of its articles:
            "Where there is overlap between protected areas and indigenous peasant territories,
            management will be shared and subjected to the norms and procedures of the nations
            themselves and the original peasant indigenous people, respecting the objectives which
            underpin the creation of these areas". </p>
<p>However, once the consultation with 36 communities was completed, the Commission
            denounced that the process had been conducted under considerable local authority
            pressure and without the necessary information for the main actors to be able understand
            the aforementioned project in detail.</p>
<p>The transoceanic road project is currently being re-assessed due to a new route proposal
            from Villa Turari to Trinidad following TIPNIS' external borders. Nevertheless, Isiboro
            Sécure Indigenous Sub-central (SCIIS) group members are still opposed to the project and
            consider the new route a threat to their territory because it would drive the expansion
            of the settling process in the northern part of the territory. The settlers, on the
            other hand, see the project as an opportunity to have access to new lands, natural
            resources and markets. Furthermore, the indigenous organizations themselves are also
            divided. In recent months this resulted in new clashes involving physical violence
            between the different conflicting parties (<sup><a href="#B11">LA JORNADA,
               2013</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Therefore, despite the temporary suspension of the road building project, the tendency
            is for the conflict to continue and be further aggravated by the fact that the
            indigenous organization itself is divided into two irreconcilable groups, as reported by
            human rights organizations and exposed in the Bolivian and international press.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp156880"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">3.2. The Camisea Case in Peru</p>
<p>The second emblematic case considered regarding conflicts between indigenous people and
            development is the case of the Camisea gas project. The aim of this program is to expand
            the exploration of natural gas underground deposits in the Kugapakori-Nahua-Nanti (KNN)
            Reserve, 500 kilometres east of Lima, in Cuenca Ucayaly, Cusco Department, Convención
            Province, Southeastern Peru. The reserve, known by its acronym KNN was established in
            1990 to protect the territorial rights of the nahuas, natis, machiguegas, as well as
            other peoples living inside the reserve who have had limited relations with the rest of
            society, including contact with other indigenous communities. A fundamental factor in
            its creation was "the tragic experience of contact some nahua communities had with a
            group of loggers in 1984, resulting in the death of half the nahua population through
            illnesses contracted via this contact" (<sup><a href="#B02">CODPI,
               2013</a></sup>). During the following decades, both illegal loggers and missionaries
            persevered with their incursions into these territories, the latter in order to
            evangelize the indigenous communities, thus continuing to threaten the lives of the
            nahuas and other groups settled in the region.</p>
<p>In 1987, oil prospecting led the transnational company Shell to find large gas deposits
            in the Camisea sector which became subsequently known as the San Martin and Cashiriani
            gas fields. Extraction operations only started in 2004, when the Peruvian authorities
            formally initiated the Camisea Consortium Project. The main objective of this new mega
            project is to capture and transport natural gas from the above-mentioned deposits to a
            liquid separation plant in Malvinas, on the banks of the Urubamba River from where the
            gas can be subsequently transported via a pipeline to Lima and eventually exported.
            Since 2002, the exploration of these deposits has been overseen by the Peruvian
            government. It has expanded extraction operations in the Camisea region by creating a
            corporate consortium involving a number of transnational companies such as Repsol,
            Pluspetrol, Hunt Oil, SK Energy and Sonatrach.</p>
<p>The Peruvian government has, through a number of communiqués and press conferences,
            reiterated the benefits of exploring these gas deposits to the country. Amongst the
            reasons highlighted is that Peru will have an abundant supply of gas to replace other
            fuels (in particular hydrocarbons) which have to be imported. Therefore, it is expected
            that with these deposits the hydrocarbon trade balance will revert negative trends and
            improve the country's revenues and balance of payments. Another recurring argument
            relates to job creation and economic growth in the gas reserve region, where the gas
            processing or fractionation plants and the export terminal (Pisco) are found. Finally,
            it is argued that the project will also contribute to improve the environment through
            the use of a less polluting source of energy.</p>
<p>By contrast, those opposing the project's expansion argue that the peoples inhabiting
            the area are threatened with extinction. They claim that the indigenous territories will
            become the site for conducting a number of seismic studies and for constructing 21
            wells, a liquid gas pipeline and other infrastructure works associated to the extraction
            projects (roads, machine rooms, etc.). For these opponents:</p>
<blockquote><p>"In practice, this will mean sentencing to death a number of communities and the
               likely disappearance of a whole system of thinking which is borne out of and founded
               on their land. These are communities which have for many years safeguarded the
               biodiversity of the Peruvian forest in this region. All this, of course, in the name
               of progress and the common good" (CODPI, op. cit.: p. 2).</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, different indigenous organizations in the region and across Peru have requested
            the intervention of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
            Racial Discrimination (ICERD). A recent letter addressed to President Ollanta Humala,
            signed by 58 organizations demanded that the project be immediately stopped and that the
            Peruvian government issue a public statement recognizing the inviolability of the KNN
            Reserve and adjacent territories "to guarantee the survival and the rights of indigenous
            peoples in voluntary isolation and to meet Peru's obligations in terms of human rights
            and the environment". The letter finished by concluding that if this does not happen and
            the expansion goes ahead the government "will not only be violating national and
            international laws, but will also be overseeing a development project whose consequences
            may be lethal to one of the most vulnerable indigenous groups in the country". Thus,
            injustice to unprecedented proportions will be countenanced "threatening the existence
            of a whole world, an entire system of thought and social organization: those of the
            indigenous peoples who live in the territories which are now threatened". </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp172032"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Final considerations</p>
<p>A first consideration to emerge from the exposition above relates to the fact that the
            aim of questioning the evolutionist, Western and Eurocentric conception of development
            is not to improve the definition of this concept, but to radically question the way
            which is has been employed in Latin America and other "underdeveloped" countries.
            Moreover, it leads us to reflect on fact that if there is a single roadmap that leads us
            to development, the indigenous people must necessarily follow this route, thus
            abdicating other types of knowledge and Cosmo visions which - according to this premise
            - turn them into pre-modern or backwards societies. Such a development model would
            exclude precisely the interests, the words, visions, and wisdom of those who should
            apparently most benefit from development, namely, the continent's poorer populations and
            indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>A recent study pertinently argues that "the demands of indigenous populations for land
            emerges from their need to conserve and/or defend their systems of production and
            traditional ways of life in face of the growing pressure from the capitalist system and
            the expansion of the institutional State". There is no doubt that this pressure also
            carries with it an ideological-civilizing component which - in addition to transforming
            the space occupied by indigenous populations - also disrupts, in the medium-term, their
            vernacular identitary associations. Indeed, the main object of many of these communities
            is not the acquisition of material goods. They tend to give preference to their social
            associations, cultural identities, the precursors of reciprocity within a different
            economic system, where alternative forms of exchange and mutual help prevail.</p>
<p>Refuting the above discourse means believing that the development concept was built upon
            an inevitable historical narrative, a naturalized product, that can be applied to all
            peoples. For this reason, we usually end up confronting the forcefulness of an
            ethnocentric vision which constructs its modernizing project based on the notion of
            unlimited growth and exploitation of natural and human resources. Thus, financial
            criteria are imposed which go against the objectives of sustainability, the preservation
            of the ecosystem and the cultural values of the peoples who inhabit these ecosystems. As
            Escobar reminds us, "It is not only ecological factors and conditions define the
            practices which determine how nature is appropriated and used, but also cultural
            values". This Colombian anthropologist warns us that "the struggles for cultural
            difference, ethnic identity and local autonomy of a particular territory contribute to
            redefine the environmental conflicts agenda beyond economics and ecology" (<sup><a href="#B06">ESCOBAR, 2010, p. 103</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The two cases here described reveal a permanent and inextricable tension between the
            development objectives of nations, founded upon concepts such as progress and growth and
            a broader conception which sees humanity as essentially integrated within its
            environment and supported by the notion of the good life. In his classic study on
            alterity, <sup><a href="#B25">Tzvetan Todorov (1991)</a></sup> asks: how can we
            accept the other, someone who is distinct from us, as both equal and different? This
            question becomes even more incisive when reflecting on the occurrence of ethnocentrism,
            that is, the tendency to bring the values of the society to which I belong to the level
            of a universal category. Since the conquest of America, this Eurocentric vision has
            built an interpretation of the world by ignoring other languages, other knowledge and
            other hermeneutics. That is why the indigenous people's struggle also comprises a
            struggle for achieving equality within difference, for having the same rights as the
            rest of "civilized" citizens, within a framework of respect for what is distinct and
            different. Recognition of difference within equality is an arduous and ongoing task to
            which the communities of the American continent are committed. </p>
<p>For this reason, treating conflicts of ownership and use of natural resources within a
            broader context means to consider the different interests at hand, in particular,
            meeting the specific needs of communities living in these territories. It also means
            considering the effects of conflicts on the most vulnerable segments of society. This
            involves not only solving the biophysical risks associated to entrepreneurial or other
            types of activities which often lead to "natural catastrophes", but above all, to take
            into account the social and cultural impacts of applying specific development models
            which prioritize the concept of growth and the generation of material wealth and, as a
            result, lead to environmentally unsustainable, socially unequal and culturally uniform
            solutions. Therefore, it is essential to counteract the unilateral narrative of
            modernity, development and globalization which reinforces a utilitarian and productivist
            attitude toward nature and the rest of humanity. The task, therefore, is to conceive a
            model which can overcome this westernizing epistemology and its consequent narrow vision
            of development to build a new type of thinking based on the certainty that across the
            world knowledge is diverse and that this diversity constantly enriches our human
            experience.</p>

<a name="fn01"></a><p><strong>i</strong> Discussions prior to ECLAC's foundation already pointed out that it was essential to
               focus on the need for international action in terms of economic development and there
               was a "tendency to see the problems of the underdeveloped countries from the
               perspective of the highly developed European countries and the USA" (<sup><a href="#B23">SUNKEL y PAZ, 2004, p. 21</a></sup>).</p>

<a name="fn02"></a><p><strong>ii</strong> The concepts of evolution, progress and growth are similar in that they all assume
               that there is gradual and continuous change supported by scientific and technical

<a name="fn03"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn03"></a><p><strong>iii</strong> According to Jacques Lambert, a French sociologist and demographer, Brazil comprised
               two different countries. In his classic study entitled Two Brazils, Lambert compares
               and contrasts the urban, industrial and prosperous South with better living
               conditions, with the rural, poor, archaic and undernourished Northeast (<sup><a href="#B12">LAMBERT, 1963</a></sup>).</p>

<a name="fn04"></a><p><strong>iv</strong> A report from the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), a United
               Nations agency, stated that 2010 saw the greatest number of natural disasters
               recorded in the last three decades. The number of people who lost their lives in such
               incidents during this year reached 300,000.</p>

<a name="fn05"></a><p><strong>v</strong> We call this a re-introduction because we argue that the origin of these concerns
               are found in the visionary work of one of Marx's contemporaries, William Morris, who
               had already introduced elements of an eco-socialist vision into his writings, in
               particular in his utopian novel News from Nowhere.</p>

<a name="fn06"></a><p><strong>vi</strong> For example, it is estimated that if the average energy consumption in the United

<a name="fn07"></a><p><strong>vii</strong> In 2007 an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report stated that:
               "There is new and compelling evidence that most of the global warming observed over
               the last fifty years is attributable to human activities" (<sup><a href="#B09">IPCC, 2007</a></sup>).</p>

<a name="fn08"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn08"></a><p><strong>viii</strong> The study, published by the US's National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), claims that
               among the regions which could be most severely affected by climate change are South
               of the Amazon, Southern Europe, Central America and some tropical regions in Africa

               However, the large migratory flux only began in the 1980s. Reasons included the
               relocation of miners from Oruro and Potosí. Another reason was the expansion of coca

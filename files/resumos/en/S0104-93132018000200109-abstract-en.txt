Abstract This article proposes an ethnographic investigation on subjects as &#8220;intimate&#8221; or familial implied in the immigration of Surinamese people to the Netherlands, intensified by the recent crisis in the Surinamese economy. Emphasizing familial misunderstandings caused by practices as &#8220;obsolete&#8221; by well-established immigrants - such as children&#8217;s games seen as &#8220;violent&#8221; - and the processes of &#8220;adaptation&#8221; of new immigrants to the &#8220;environment&#8221;, analyzed through notions such as Gregory Bateson&#8217;s deutero-learning. Images of &#8220;complexity&#8221;, &#8220;culture&#8221; and &#8220;authenticity&#8221; implied in the process of migration. Will also be analyzed, as well as the effects of the ethnographer&#8217;s presence on the descriptive choices and emphasis that make up the text.

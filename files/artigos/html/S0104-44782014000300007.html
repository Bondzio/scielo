We focus on one of the most unequal countries in the globe, Brazil,    and analyze the extent to which this country's CCT program - Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia    (BF, Family Grant) program - is able to improve the life chances of extremely    poor beneficiaries, through the three major goals of PBF: First, to immediately    end hunger; second, to create basic social rights related to healthcare and    education; finally, considering also complementary policies, to integrate adults    into the job market. The analysis relies on a quantitative survey with 4,000    beneficiaries and a qualitative survey comprised of in-depth interviews with    38 program's participants from all the regions of the country in 2008, it means    that this study is about the five first years of the PBF. In order to answer    the research questions, we ran four probit analyses related: a) the determinants    of the realization of prenatal care; b) the determinants of food security among    BF beneficiaries, c) the determinants that adult BF recipients will return to    school, d) the determinants that a BF beneficiary will obtain a job. Important    results from the study are: First, those who before their participation on PBF    were at the margins have now been able to access healthcare services on a more    regular basis. Thus, the women at the margins who were systematically excluded    - black women, poorly educated and from the North - now, after their participation    in the CCT program, have more access to prenatal care and can now count with    more availability of public healthcare network. Second, before entering the    Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia program, 50.3% of the participants faced severe food insecurity.    This number went down to 36.8% in very five years. Men are more likely than    women; non-blacks more likely than blacks; and South and Centre-West residents    more likely than Brazilians from other regions; to become food secure while    participating in BF. Third, instead, that moment in 2008, a small proportion    of the adult participants indeed were able to return to school and to increase    their educational qualifications. The lack of technical skills and the huge    predominance of informal employment are central social problems in Brazil and    that the PBF has failed to address such issues. This study confirms what other    previous studies have reported on: BF has had a positive impact in reducing    poverty in the country. Hence the main contribution of the present study is    in identifying the main determinants of unequal results among individuals participating    in the BF program: why some, but not others, are more easily able to access    the healthcare or to overcome food insecurity while in the program?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords</b>:    conditional cash transfer programs (CCT); family grant; food security; extremely    poverty in Brazil; social rights in Brazil.</font></p> <hr noshade size="1">     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O artigo analisa    se o Estado, por meio de programas de transfer&ecirc;ncia condicional de renda    (TCC), pode reduzir a pobreza e a extrema pobreza nas sociedades marcadas por    elevados n&iacute;veis de concentra&ccedil;&atilde;o de renda. Concentramo-nos    em um dos pa&iacute;ses mais desiguais do mundo, o Brasil, analisando at&eacute;    que ponto os programas TCC desse pa&iacute;s - como o Programa Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia    (PBF) - s&atilde;o capazes de melhorar as oportunidades de vida dos benefici&aacute;rios    extremamente pobres, por meio de tr&ecirc;s principais objetivos do PBF: (<i>i</i>)    para que cesse imediatamente a fome; (<i>ii</i>) a cria&ccedil;&atilde;o de    direitos sociais b&aacute;sicos relacionados &agrave; sa&uacute;de e &agrave;    educa&ccedil;&atilde;o; (<i>iii</i>) por fim, considerando tamb&eacute;m as    pol&iacute;ticas complementares, para integrar adultos no mercado de trabalho.    A an&aacute;lise baseia-se em uma pesquisa quantitativa com 4 000 benefici&aacute;rios    e uma pesquisa qualitativa composta de entrevistas em profundidade com os participantes    38 do programa de todas as regi&otilde;es do pa&iacute;s, em 2008. O estudo    refere-se aos cinco primeiros anos do PBF. Rodamos quatro an&aacute;lises PROBIT    relacionadas (<i>i</i>) aos determinantes da realiza&ccedil;&atilde;o do pr&eacute;-natal;    (<i>ii</i>) aos determinantes da seguran&ccedil;a alimentar entre os benefici&aacute;rios    do BF; (<i>iii</i>) aos determinantes que os destinat&aacute;rios adultos do    PBF v&atilde;o retornar &agrave; escola e (<i>iv</i>) aos determinantes que    um benefici&aacute;rio PBF obter&aacute; um emprego. Importantes resultados    do estudo s&atilde;o os seguintes: em primeiro lugar, aqueles que antes de sua    participa&ccedil;&atilde;o no PBF estavam marginalizados foram capazes de acessar    regularmente os servi&ccedil;os de sa&uacute;de. Assim, as mulheres marginalizadas    e sistematicamente exclu&iacute;das - as negras, de baixa escolaridade e do    Norte - agora, ap&oacute;s a sua participa&ccedil;&atilde;o no programa CCT,    t&ecirc;m mais acesso ao pr&eacute;-natal e podem contar com mais disponibilidade    de rede p&uacute;blica de sa&uacute;de. Em segundo lugar, antes de entrar no    programa Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia, 50,3% dos participantes enfrentaram inseguran&ccedil;a    alimentar grave. Esse n&uacute;mero caiu para 36,8% nos primeiros cinco anos    do programa. Os homens s&atilde;o mais propensos do que as mulheres para obter    a seguran&ccedil;a alimentar ao participar do PBF; n&atilde;o-negros s&atilde;o    mais prov&aacute;veis do que os negros; moradores das regi&otilde;es e Sul e    Centro-Oeste s&atilde;o mais propensos do que os brasileiros de outras. Em terceiro    lugar, em 2008 uma pequena propor&ccedil;&atilde;o dos participantes adultos    foi capaz de voltar para a escola e aumentar suas qualifica&ccedil;&otilde;es    educacionais. A falta de compet&ecirc;ncias t&eacute;cnicas e da enorme predomin&acirc;ncia    do emprego informal s&atilde;o problemas sociais centrais no Brasil e que o    PBF n&atilde;o conseguiu resolver. Este estudo confirma o que outros estudos    anteriores relataram: o PBF teve um impacto positivo na redu&ccedil;&atilde;o    da pobreza no pa&iacute;s. Portanto, a principal contribui&ccedil;&atilde;o    do presente estudo est&aacute; em identificar os principais determinantes dos    resultados desiguais entre os indiv&iacute;duos que participam do PBF: por que    alguns, mas n&atilde;o outros, s&atilde;o mais facilmente capazes de acessar    a cuidados de sa&uacute;de ou de superar a inseguran&ccedil;a alimentar, enquanto    inseridos no programa?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palavras-chave</b>:    programa de transfer&ecirc;ncia condicionada de renda; Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia;    seguran&ccedil;a alimentar; extrema pobreza no Brasil; direitos sociais no Brasil.</font></p> <hr noshade size="1">     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>I. Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his renowned    mid-twenty-century piece, T. H. Marshall compellingly argued that the existence    of equality of opportunity is essential to the long-term survival of capitalist    democracies (Marshall 1950). Without equality of opportunity, the formal legalistic    civil and political equality embodied in the idea of citizenship in the long    run can be perceived as meaningless and the political order risks losing its    legitimacy. Marshall cautioned that the presence and full fruition of civil    and political rights consecrated under a democratic regime do not imply the    existence of socio-economic equality or that it will ever be created. On the    contrary, under capitalism, which is quintessentially unequal, political and    civil equality coexist, albeit uneasily, with socio-economic inequalities. According    to Marshall, when the latter are extreme, this uneasy coexistence becomes highly    conflictive, with the potential of destroying the social fabric. The struggle    for social rights that generate and guarantee equality of opportunity, therefore,    is presented as being crucial to attenuating substantive inequalities. The key    element upholding a considerable degree of equality of opportunity, Marshall    added, is universal access to the educational system, which enables individuals    to gain entry into the job market and to attain their material independence    and the conditions to fully realize their rights and autonomy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What happens to    highly unequal societies in which the virtuous cycle to which Marshall alludes    does not exist or does not contemplate significant proportions of the population?    Can the state act to ensure a less unequal playing field for those at the margins?    This article examines whether the state, through a specific social policy called    Conditional Cash Transfer programs (CCT), can reduce the poverty and extremely    poverty in societies marred by high levels of income concentration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article focuses    on one of the most unequal countries in the globe, Brazil, and analyzes the    extent to which this country's CCT program - the worldly renowned <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>    (BF, "family grant") program - is able to improve the life chances of extremely    poor beneficiaries.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We seek to verify    whether CCT policies have any impact on three important spheres of an individual's    life (Cohen &amp; Franco 2006): the consumption, <i>i.e.</i>, among other things,    the attainment of food security; the inversion, which refers to access to the    educational system and the acquisition of professional qualifications; and the    production, which relates to the entry into the job market. For this, we take    the three major goals of PBF (according to documents from the Ministry of Social    Development) and check its successes and limitations: First, to immediately    end hunger, with the direct transfer of cash to beneficiaries; second, to create    basic social rights related to healthcare and education, by making school attendance    for children and adolescents mandatory, for instance - has been designed with    the intent of ending the intergenerational cycle of poverty. Finally, the program    also has complementary and integrated policies, which aim at the integration    of adults into the job market, so that the families can overcome their present    situation of economic vulnerability.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We use a mixed    method approach. The analysis relies on a quantitative survey with 4,000 beneficiaries    and a qualitative survey comprised of in-depth interviews with thirty eight    program's participants from all the regions of the country<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a>    in 2008, it means that this study is about the five first years of the PBF.    Whereas several studies of CCT programs utilize aggregate socioeconomic and    demographic data to analyze the impact of these policies (Alvarez, Devoto &amp;    Winters 2008; Lome&iacute; 2008), this article uses individual-level data and    is better positioned to capture the beneficiaries' description of the impact    of the BF program on their lives before and after they joined the program.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis is    divided into six sections. The first one focuses on how intergenerational persistence    diminishes the life chances of poor individuals. The second section briefly    summarizes the basic features of CCT programs, their functioning and objectives.    The third section focuses on the basic aspects of PBF in particular. The subsequent    unit of the article center on information about method and data. Section five    centers on whether BF helps children and adolescents of the poor and extremely    poor have basic health care and it still focuses on the program's impact on    the attainment of food security<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>;    and section six examines the beneficiaries' success in entering the job market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We conclude by    showing that BF is very successful when it comes to helping individuals move    up in the scale of food <i>in</i>security, <i>i.e.</i>, to either overcome hunger    or to face food scarcity less frequently. The results for educational and professional    attainment and entry in the job market, indicate that the program improves the    life chances of future generations much more than present ones and that there    are significant racial, gender and regional gaps in the way this amelioration    takes place.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consequently the    main contribution of the present study is in identifying the most important    determinants of unequal results among individuals and families participating    in the BF program Hence, we believe this study can make a good contribution    to our understanding of the impact of BF, and as a case study, it can help us    understand the issues surrounding CCT programs in general.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>II. Life chances,    intergenerational persistence and poverty</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the    United Nations Development Programme's last major report on the topic, the proportion    of people living on less than $1.25 a day was reduced from 47% in 1990 to 22%    in 2010 (UNDP 2013)<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Nevertheless,    despite some progress, extreme poverty remains an alarming problem in the world's    developing regions. Their most visible face is hunger. Without access to enough    nutrients, individuals starve on a daily basis. Poor individuals are commonly    identified as those lacking one or two dollars a day<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>.    Nevertheless, poverty and especially extreme poverty are more than a monetary    condition, <i>i.e.</i> the lack of financial resources needed to purchase food.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, poverty,    and extreme poverty in particular, began to be seen both as a specific material    condition (or lack thereof) and as a distinct set of life chances as well. Extreme    poverty decreases the likelihood that an individual, or specific groups within    society, will have access to the educational system, be employed on a permanent    basis throughout their lifetime and enjoy food security, physical and mental    health. Extreme poverty is more than a transient condition; it hampers people's    ability to attain individual autonomy on a more permanent basis (Despouy 1996).    Furthermore, it tends to persist over time, <i>i.e.</i> to reproduce itself    intergenerationally. Intergenerational persistence makes reference to the degree    to which an individual's life is shaped by his or her parents' material and    non-material conditions. Children of extremely poor parents tend to be undernourished    and to drop out of school prematurely. As they lack formal education and professional    skills, they tend to insert themselves in a precarious job market, usually devoid    of social benefits and whose earnings are insufficient for the fulfillment of    daily needs (Cohen &amp; Franco 2006, p. 2)<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>.    Thus, extreme poverty, by locking up individuals or specific groups in the lowest    educational and occupational strata of a social structure, severally undermines    their ability to attain the autonomy needed in order for them to become masters    of their own destinies. These individuals become stuck in a vicious circle,    which renders them powerless and prevents them from enjoying the freedoms that    are available to others.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More critical views    of extreme poverty, thus, call attention to its more permanent features, which    transcend merely gaining access to a steady supply of food. This perspective    also emphasizes that not always do poverty and extreme poverty and their corollaries    such as famines stem from natural calamities (Sen 1981). On the contrary, phenomena    like these more commonly result not from a "crisis of provisions" (scarcity    of goods), but from a "crisis of entitlement" (Dahrendorf 1988), which is a    socially unequal structure of access to the goods and services available in    a society.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Latin America,    according to some conservative estimates, 16.6% of the population, approximately    91 million individuals, lives below the line of poverty - $2 dollars a day (World    Bank 2009, p. 47). There are significant oscillations across countries and within    them. Approximately 42.3% of the population are said to be poor in Nicaragua,    whereas in Costa Rica it encompasses about 8% of the population (Economic Commission    for Latin America and the Caribbean 2007). Furthermore, poverty and extreme    poverty in rural areas tend to be higher than in the urban segments of most    countries (Vald&eacute;s 2000). In Brazil, for instance, the national level    of poverty is around 32.7%; but it varies between 14.4% in the state of S&atilde;o    Paulo to 62.2% in the state of Alagoas; and there are considerable differences    between the urban centers and the countryside.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last two    decades poverty and hunger have been highly reduced, however in previous decades    events in Latin America exacerbated the problems around the issue of poverty.    The transition to democracy in the 1980s, in the midst of the so-called "third-wave    of democratization" (Huntington 1991), fostered the expectation that, with the    fall of the dictatorships, social rights would be increased throughout the region.    Civilian governments would be able to address head-on the high levels of socioeconomic    inequalities that for centuries have plagued the region. This expectation did    not materialize. Some countries - such as Brazil, but also Argentina, Bolivia,    Peru, and Uruguay - experienced a dual transition. The change from authoritarianism    to democratic regimes paralleled the dismantling of the developmental state,    which for several decades had been the engine of economic growth in these societies.    The stabilization and structural adjustment policies that some countries adopted    have tended to reduce the state's offer of services when it comes to education,    heath, and social security. However, most importantly for this region, it is    the fact that these policies aimed at reducing the state's presence in the economy    were implemented in societies that did not have a previous welfare state, founded    upon Keynesian policies (Sposati 2002).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Quite the contrary,    throughout the 1940s and 1970s, period in which these countries implemented    the policies of import substitution industrialization, the states of the region    were active in the areas of education, health and social security (Cohen &amp;    Franco 2006, p. 5). However, the access to the social services provided by the    state was far from being universal; in fact, it did not fully include the individuals    at the very bottom of the social ladder<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a>.    The dictatorships that rose in reaction to the wave of progressive regimes in    the 1960s and 1970s were for the most part founded upon pacts that were highly    exclusionary politically, but that also did not involve significant advances    in terms of social rights. Thus, when neoliberal policies become predominant    in the region, they reached societies that lacked an enlarged social contract,    deepening the tension between, on the one hand, the universal realization of    citizenship rights, and, on the other, the decrease in the marked divisions    between the poor and the non-poor (Sposati 2002, p. 7).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is within this    context of profound economic changes that some countries adopted a different    approach to social policies. Instead of implementing social policies of universalistic    scope, some countries chose to center the state's resources on the fight against    poverty and extreme poverty, <i>i.e.</i> to implement socially targeted policies,    among them the so-called conditional cash transfer programs.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>III. Conditional    cash transfer programs</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1990s governments    from the Global South - some of them spurred on by international funding institutions    - felt the need to devise new instruments of social policy in order to attenuate    the negative social effects of the globalization and the structural adjustment    processes, but in ways that would be compatible with the logic of market-based    economies (Lomel&iacute; 2008, p. 2). As a consequence, this new model of social    regulation emphasizes not labor rights, but human rights - among them universal    access to healthcare, education and social security.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conditional    cash transfer programs emerged from the consensus that the intergenerational    transmission of poverty stems from the lack of governmental investment in the    formation of human capital in the areas of education, healthcare and nutrition    and that the direct transfer of income to poor and extremely poor families and    individuals could be a good way of overcoming this debility. According to the    World Bank, as of 2009, twenty six countries of the world had active CCT programs    (Fiszbein &amp; Schady 2009). Even though they have been more widely disseminated    throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, where they have become important    social policies, they have also been adopted in other parts of the world, such    as Sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia, and the Middle East (Adatp &amp; Basett    2009). Currently, CCT programs have been implemented in 17 of the 20 Latin American    countries. This type of program has not been adopted in Cuba and Haiti, and    it was deactivated in Nicaragua (Gonnet 2012).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CCT programs    around the world share a whole host of similarities. They target the poor and    extremely poor population and seek to attenuate the effects of hardship on the    key phases of an individual's life. Hence, they focus on the nutrition of pregnant    and nursing women; the nourishment and immunization of young children; and the    education of children and adolescents. They present variations when it comes    to the selection of beneficiaries and the functioning of the program. By and    large, in a first stage, the central government selects the cities or municipalities    which will receive the resources from this public policy. In order to be selected,    municipalities have to be able to offer healthcare and educational public services    and especially to be able to respond to the growth in demand that the CCT programs    generate. In the sequence, programs select families within the municipalities    and the selection criteria also vary. To be part of the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>    a low per-capita income is the key deciding factor. The Chilean counterpart,    the CCT <i>Chile Solid&aacute;rio</i>, in contrast, selects extremely poor families    that also have adults over 65 years old residing with the family (Soares <i>et    al.</i>, 2007). In some cases, the central government selects the beneficiaries    directly and transfers the resources to subnational governments to administer    the program; in others, the central government transfers both the resources    and the selection process to subnational administrations<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Central to these    programs is the notion that beneficiaries receive financial resources on condition    that they perform certain activities related to healthcare and education. There    is also variation across countries in reference to the fulfillment of these    conditionalities. The <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> in Brazil, for instance, demands    that the program's participants meet their obligations related to both healthcare    and education in order to continue receiving the program's resources. In Mexico's    <i>Oportunidades</i> and Nicaragua's <i>Red de Protecci&oacute;n Social da Nicar&aacute;gua</i>    (now, deactivated), on the other hand, the social policies are subdivided into    totally separate programs. Beneficiaries that meet the health conditionalities    can continue to receive the health benefit, regardless of their performance    in the educational realm and vice-versa (Lomel&iacute; 2008, p. 8).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These CCT programs    are predicated on the premise that they can create a positive balance in the    cost-benefit analysis that participants and other actors undertake (Brain &amp;    Chudnovsky 2005). First, these policies are successful when the beneficiaries    deem that the cost of fulfilling the conditionalities is lower than the financial    benefits offered by the central or subnational government (Cohen and Franco    2006, p. 12). An important intervening factor in this cost-benefit analysis    that participants undertake is the offer of services of health, education and    nutrition made available by the state, which can enable beneficiaries to fulfill    the conditionalities or prevent them from doing so. In other words, an essential    ingredient to the success of conditional cash transfer policies is public investment    in the areas of education, healthcare and social service, so that beneficiaries    can meet their obligations. There is also a second cost-benefit analysis that    is important to the success of the program. The cash benefit offered to participants    has to be enough for individuals to overcome food <i>in</i>security and be able    to improve their educational and professional skills. However, the benefit cannot    be too high so as to de-stimulate the search for integration into the job market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governments and    international financial and aid organizations also engage into a cost-benefit    analysis. Governments have faced a several restriction on their fiscal capacity    to undertake major investments in the social area and for them the CCTs are    a way of doing a lot spending very little. The most expensive CCTs, the Brazilian    <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> and the Mexican <i>Opportunidades</i>, for instance,    cost less than 0.50 of the gross domestic product (Fiszbein &amp; Schady 2009,    p. 5). As participants spent all the resources that they receive - mostly with    the purchase of food (Rocha 2009) -, they stimulate the local economy, and therefore,    generate taxes for governments. Thus, the CCT programs have been shown to cost    less than their nominal cost might suggest<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a>.    The international organizations have also endorsed the CCTs, not only because    these measures do not jeopardize fiscal discipline that they praise (and demand),    but most importantly to change the perception that their previous interventions    in Latin America and in the Global South in general have not had any impact    on the alleviation of poverty (Soares <i>et al.</i> 2007, p. 10).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By and large, CCT    programs have presented positive results when it comes to increasing children's    and adolescents' school attendance; improving children's immunization record    and the frequency with which babies, pregnant women, new mothers and nursing    mothers access prenatal and postnatal care; and increasing food consumption    among the poor (Behrman, Parker &amp; Todd 2009; Barham &amp; Malaluccio 2009;    Adato &amp; Bassett 2009, p. 9). The predominant view is that the programs have    been able to alleviate the most visible face of poverty, hunger and its health-related    implications.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, there    have been some criticisms pertaining to CCT programs' effect beyond the consumption    sphere, especially when it comes to their ability to improve the educational    and professional skills of participants and their insertion into the job market.    In the case of Mexico's CCT, <i>Oportunidades</i>, studies have shown that there    has been little or no impact on the improvement of school learning, on children's    cognitive development or on the level of employment among beneficiaries (Berhman,    Parker &amp; Todd 2009, p. 464). Another limitation that plagues some CCT programs    relates to governments' reduced capacity to effectively respond to the increase    in demand for public healthcare and educational services that these policies    generate, such as in the case of Nicaragua (Bradshaw &amp; Vazquez 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will briefly    describe the structure of the CCT in Brazil.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>IV. The <i>Bolsa    Fam&iacute;lia</i> Program in Brazil</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>    is considered the largest conditional cash transfer program in Latin America    and the Caribbean, with 11 million families among its participants from all    the regions of the country. This CCT is the result of the amalgamation of previous    programs. First, the PETI (<i>Programa de Erradica&ccedil;&atilde;o do Trabalho    Infantil</i>), which was a policy aimed at the eradication of child labor. Second,    the <i>Bolsa Escola</i> (or School Grant), which gave cash to families in exchange    for their children between 6 and 15 years to attend at least 85% of the school    year. Third, the <i>Bolsa Alimenta&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> (or Food Grant), which    forced participants to immunize their children and pregnant women to do prenatal    and postnatal medical exams in exchange for the receipt of cash that could only    be spent on the purchase of food (Soares <i>et al.</i>, 2007, p. 10). The BF    was created in 2003 in order to decrease the costs of disbursement of resources    and to make it easier to verify whether the beneficiaries comply with the program's    requirements.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is considerable    variation in the size of the benefits that each family receives under the <i>Bolsa    Fam&iacute;lia</i>. Participants are selected among the poor, whose family monthly    per capita income is up to R$ 140 or US$ 59 (February 2014 exchange rate); and    the very poor, whose monthly family per capita income is less than R$ 70 or    US$ 30. There are three types of cash transfers. First, the "basic benefit"    of R$ 70 (or US$ 30) per month is given to extremely poor families, regardless    of whether they have children and adolescents. Second, the "variable benefit"    of R$ 32 (or US$ 14) per month, which is paid to families for each of their    children and adolescents (between zero and 15 years of age) for a maximum of    five children. Finally, there is the "variable benefit for adolescents", which    covers families with youth between 16 and 17 years. In this case, families receive    R$ 38 (US$ 16) per month, for a maximum of two adolescents.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s    participants must fulfill a series of conditions in order to continue to receive    the benefit. Children under six years must be immunized; pregnant women, babies    and nursing mothers have to provide proof (through exams and records of doctor's    visits) that they have undergone prenatal and postnatal medical care; and children    and adolescents must attend school on a regular basis (85% and 75% of the time,    respectively). The goal of the program is threefold. First, to immediately end    hunger, with the direct transfer of cash to beneficiaries. Second, to create    basic social rights related to healthcare and education. This system of conditions    - making school attendance for children and adolescents mandatory, for instance    - has been designed with the intent of ending the intergenerational cycle of    poverty. Finally, the program also has complementary and integrated policies    (such as non-compulsory educational programs for parents), which aim at the    integration of adults into the job market, so that the families can overcome    their present situation of economic vulnerability.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How successful    has the program been in each of these goals?

They base their analyses on aggregate macro-socioeconomic or demographic    data, such as impact of these programs on the country's GINI coefficient (<i>ibidem</i>).    Even though analyses based on these indicators are important and very revealing,    they are deficient instruments, given that they are unable to overcome the issue    of "ecological fallacy", which it is the problem of assuming that features that    are common to the average or most of a collectivity also apply to each of its    individual parts.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, more    recently, CCTs have been evaluated using survey micro-data collected at the    individual and household level (both nationally representative household surveys    and purpose-designed surveys for impact evaluation). This article aims to contribute    to overcoming this debility, by using individual-level data.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The goal is to    understand whether the CCT program in Brazil, the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>,    has been able to address both the material and non-materials components of poverty.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>VI. Consumption    realm: health and nutrition</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This section will    focus on three aspects: the impact of <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> on the level    of children immunization and prenatal care, and also on food security, which    are elements belonging to the consumption realm in an individual's life cycle.    This article will not analyze the level of school attendance among the children    of the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s participants. The quantitative survey did    not have questions about this topic. Given that schools send the information    on school attendance directly to the CCT program, some parents are unable to    give precise information regarding their children's school attendance.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important    to mention that vaccination and prenatal care are conditions that beneficiaries    must fulfill in order to remain in the program, whereas food security of the    participants is one of the objectives of the CCT policy. Nevertheless, it is    important to verify the extent to which beneficiaries comply with the conditionalities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When it comes to    children's vaccination, studies have shown that the CCT policies in general    have had a positive impact on the immunization levels of infants and children.    Even though there is no consensus on what the minimum level of vaccination should    be, most experts point out that in order to eradicate certain diseases it is    desirable that at least 95% of the population be vaccinated (Barrett &amp; Hoel    2007). In this regard, the CCT program in Nicaragua, when it comes to vaccines    such as BCG, has been reported to have increased the immunization levels from    85% to almost 95%. Similarly, the Mexican <i>Progresa</i> (the predecessor of    <i>Oportunidades</i>) is said to have increased the coverage of MCV and BCG    by 3% - but the coverage was already high (above 90%) prior to the start of    the CCT program<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of    the Brazilian CCT program, 98.5% of the beneficiaries that are part of the survey    reported having an up-to-dated immunization card for their children prior to    their entry into <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>. After their entrance into the    program, 98.7% reported that they complied with this conditionality. It is difficult    to gauge the impact of <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> on this wide vaccination    coverage. First, even before its launch in 2003, the Brazilian population already    had a high level of immunization. Second, CCT policies that existed prior to    BF already imposed children's vaccination as a condition for families to remain    in the program. Finally, the Brazilian federal government has for a very long    time being extremely active in making vaccines widely available. Vaccines for    babies and children are free in Brazil. The federal government makes massive    annual vaccination campaigns, and divulges them in all the mass media. Moreover,    there is practically universal coverage in all the Brazilian territory even    in the most isolated rural areas, where either vaccines are taken to individual    households or health agents escort children and parents to nearby immunization    centers, as the beneficiaries' testimony attest:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I have always      taken my children to the vaccination clinics. Even when my oldest son was      small, whenever there was a vaccination campaign, I would take my children      to be immunized". (Beneficiary, from Pien, Paran&aacute;, Southern Region).</font></p> </blockquote>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Since my children      were little babies, they would always take vaccines. I used to live on a farm.      Personnel from the Navy would go there, help me carry my children to the [makeshift]      vaccination clinic in the school to be vaccinated". (Beneficiary from Corumb&aacute;,      Mato Grosso do Sul, Center-West Region).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Almost all the    <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s beneficiaries, therefore, comply with the vaccination    requirement. Only two out of the thirty eight households that were part of the    in-depth interviews had children with an immunization card not up-to-date. In    one of the cases, the child was ill and would take the missing vaccine upon    recovery; in the second case, the nearby health clinic had unexpectedly run    out of yellow fever vaccine and the child was waiting to be immunized.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With reference    to prenatal care, which is another conditionality that participants have to    meet, there has been a change in the behavior of women beneficiaries<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a>.    After entering <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> and during the five first years of    the program (2003-2008<i>)</i>, 26.5% of the women had pregnancies and 88.7%    of them complied with this requirement. It is interesting to note that there    has been a change in the profile of pregnant women who underwent prenatal monitoring.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#t1">Table    1</a> shows the probit results of the determinants of pregnant women doing prenatal    care in Brazil both before and after they became beneficiaries in the CCT program.    Only the parsimonious models are shown in all tables of this article. The independent    variables shown in <a href="#t1">Table 1</a> were coded as follows: Age group:    1 = 16-24; 2 = 25-34; 3 = 35-44; 4 = 45-54; 5 = 55 years or older; each race    is coded as 1 and 0 otherwise; educational level: 1 = illiterate; 2 = did not    finish primary school; 3 = finished primary school; 4 = finished middle school;    5 = started but did not finish high school; 6 = finished high school; 7 = started    but did not finish college; 8 = finished college; each region is coded as 1    and 0 otherwise. Before participating in the BF, the key determinants for the    realization of prenatal care were the woman's age group, educational level,    race and the region of Brazil in which she resided. First, when it comes to    age, younger women had a greater likelihood of fulfilling the requirement than    older women. For instance, women of 25 to 34 years old had 4.8% greater chance    of doing prenatal care than women between 35 and 44 years; and the same difference    was visible between each consecutive age group. Second, the more educated the    woman was, the higher the likelihood of her having done prenatal care. Third,    white and brown women also tended to do prenatal care more often than black    women. Region of residence was also an important factor<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a>.    The women beneficiaries from the South had a 3.6% higher chance of doing prenatal    care than their counterparts of the Southeast, who, in turn, had a 5.2% higher    likelihood of doing prenatal care than the participants of the North of Brazil.</font></p>     <p align="center"><a name="t1"></a></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07t01.jpg"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we focus on    the behavior of pregnant women after their entrance into the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>    program, we notice that race, level of formal schooling and the region where    the participant resides ceased to be statistically significant factors. Thus,    before their participation in the CCT program, pregnant women who would <i>not</i>    do prenatal care were predominantly black, illiterate or with very low level    of formal schooling, and those who lived in the North region of country. After    they became BF's recipients, age group was the only explanatory factor that    retained its statistical significance. The younger the pregnant woman is, the    greater the chance that she will do prenatal care. Younger women, thus, seem    to have assimilated the idea that prenatal care is necessary and should always    be done.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An important element    in the explanation of this change in the profile is the accessibility of the    healthcare. The universal right to healthcare in Brazil was introduced in the    1988 Constitution, <i>i.e.</i> over two and half decades ago. Since then, the    Brazilian state has been actively supporting the expansion of the availability    of medical care<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a>. As a    consequence, a large number of women that are 55 years or older had their children    in a country undergoing a rapid process of economic modernization and urbanization,    and in which the coverage of the public healthcare system was even more precarious    than it is today. Some of the beneficiaries clearly make this point:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I did prenatal      care only for my youngest three children. For the others, I did not. I used      to live in the countryside and there was only a pharmacy in the area, but      approximately 20 kilometers away. There was no hospital or health clinic nearby;      actually, I had my children at home". (Beneficiary, from Corumb&aacute;, Mato      Grosso, Center-West Region).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, over the    last two and half decades, women who did not have access to prenatal care can    now count with a greater availability of public healthcare network. The women    at the margins who were systematically excluded - black women, poorly educated    and from the North - now, after their participation in the CCT program, seem    to have more access to the public healthcare system.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to gauge    how the Brazilian CCT programme fares when it comes to the attainment of food    security, we elaborated a scale of food <i>in</i>security. This scale will be    used to assess a) the percentage of beneficiaries who improved their situation    of food <i>in</i>security - <i>i.e.</i> overcame hunger altogether or faced    food scarcity less often - and b) what factors explain any improvement. It is    important to mention that even though this scale resembles the 'Brazilian Scale    for the Measurement of Food Insecurity' (or EBIA) (Segall-Correa &amp; Salles-Costa    2008), especially the distinct levels of food insecurity, here we make use of    slightly different questions. The scale of food insecurity used in this study    does not address the food quality eaten, but only the amount of the same, therefore    this aspect delimit the difference between EBIA scale and this one. In fact,    our survey lacks questions about food quality for both moments, before and after    participants joined the CCT program so our statistical analysis centres on food    quantity - and not food diversity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our scale classifies    households into four categories (<a href="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07t02.jpg">Table    2</a>) and it is based on the magnitude of food accessed by an individual (<i>i.e.</i>    quantity). First, there is the <i>food security</i> category, which comprises    situations in which individuals or families face no serious dietary restrictions;    there are no problems of the diet either, and food scarcity is not a major concern.    Second, there is the category of <i>low food insecurity</i>, in which there    is concern and uncertainty over the access to food in the near future. In this    situation, usually adults face difficulties to maintain a balanced diet, <i>i.e.</i>    there is a problem in the adults' diet. Third, the category of <i>moderate food    insecurity</i> refers to situations in which there are severe quantitative restrictions    in adults' diets. Finally, <i>severe food insecurity</i> comprises cases in    which both adults and children face frequent food shortages; hunger is a likely    occurrence in these cases.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We used these categories    to classify the survey respondents and to verify whether they improved their    situation after their admission into the programme. We used six questions to    create the scale of food insecurity; one set of three questions refer to the    period before the interviewee's participation into the CCT programme and one    set refers to the period after the individual started to receive the benefit.    As our survey lacks good questions about food quality for both before and after    participants joined the programme, our statistical analysis centres primarily    on food quantity - and not food diversity. The qualitative material, however,    does enable us to make some considerations in regard to the programme's impact    on the diet diversification. The questions from the quantitative survey that    we employ are the following. First, '<i>Question 30. Before receiving the Bolsa    Fam&iacute;lia benefit, would your household lack food before you had money    to buy more supplies?'</i> whose answers are 'yes', 'no' and 'NS/NR'. Second,    '<i>Question 32. Before receiving the Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia benefit, would somebody    refrain from eating because there was not enough food for everyone</i>?', whose    answers are 'yes', 'no' and 'NS/NR (does not know or has not responded)'. Third,    '<i>Question 39. Before receiving the Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia, how long would food    last in your house?</i>, whose answers are 'one week', '2 weeks', '3 weeks',    '4 weeks (the whole month)' and 'NS/NR'. Questions 29, 31 and 38 have identical    wording but refer to the period after the participant started to receive the    CCT<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a>. <a href="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07t02.jpg">Table    2</a> displays the percentage of beneficiaries across levels of food insecurity    before and after their admission into <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before being included    in the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>, 93.3% of the participants included in the    quantitative survey suffered from food <i>in</i>security: 12.1% faced low food    insecurity; 30.9% suffered with moderate food insecurity; and a whopping proportion    of 50.3% experienced severe food insecurity. After participating in the programme,    food security became a reality that 12.0% of the beneficiaries enjoy; this represents    almost double the original amount of 6.8%. Among those still facing difficulties    with food supply and quality, 18.0% experience low food insecurity; 33.2% moderate;    and 36.8% severe food insecurity. The latter category, thus, shrank about 13    percentage points. Thus, <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> is extremely associated    to improvement of food security .</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the low margin    of error of our sample (less than 5%), we can project what these numbers mean    for the real population of 11.1 million participating households. A reduction    of 13.4% in severe food insecurity indicates that approximately 1.5 million    households or 6 million individuals (assuming an average family size of four)    ceased to experience hunger on a daily basis. Similarly, an increase in 5.2%    in households attaining food security implies that the concern over access to    food came to an end for approximately half a million households (or 2.3 million    individuals). These numbers in themselves are extremely impressive and attest    to <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s great accomplishments.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07t02.jpg">Table    2</a> shows the changes across categories of food insecurity, <i>i.e.</i> the    proportion of <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> beneficiaries who moved up or down    in the scale, considering only the first five years of the program. For instance,    out of all the beneficiaries who faced severe food insecurity before joining    the programme, 33.4% improved their situation: 3.5% now enjoy food security;    7.4% have low food insecurity and 22.4% experience moderate levels of food insecurity.    If we add all those beneficiaries who moved up the scale (<i>i.e.</i> those    who do not face food insecurity anymore or experience it less frequently), the    numbers show that about one-third of the sample improved their situation, which    is quite a feat for social policies that cost so little, such as the CCT programmes.    Once again, if we project this proportion to the universe of 11.1 families included    in the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>, we will conclude that through this CCT policy    approximately 3 million families no longer face hunger on a daily basis, which    is extraordinary.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand,    approximately two-thirds of the participants in the programme remained in the    same point of the scale of food insecurity that they were before receiving the    family grant. What accounts for the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s apparent difficult    in moving more people up the scale, <i>i.e.</i>, towards food security? First,    it is the participants' level of extreme poverty. <a href="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07t02.jpg">Table    2</a> shows that there is an association between the position that the participant    was in the scale of food insecurity before becoming a beneficiary and their    situation after their entry into <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>. Some numbers show    the weight of this point of departure. For instance, it is easier for a family    facing low food insecurity to attain food security after entering BF (18.7%    of them did so), than for a family experiencing severe food insecurity (only    3.5% attained food security).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The profile of    those participants who after receiving <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> started to    enjoy food security is also an important element. Who are those beneficiaries?    In order to answer this question, we ran a probit analysis using the attainment    of food security after admission into the programme as the dependent variable    (coded as 1 for the individuals that were in the food security category after    receiving <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> and 0 otherwise). The explanatory factors    include whether the individual is unemployed; for those who have a job, whether    they work in the informal or formal sector of the economy; family per capita    income; the time the participant has been a CCT beneficiary and whether he or    she went back to school after joining the programme<a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14"><sup>14</sup></a>.    We expect that the following individuals will attain food security: those who    are employed; those who work in the formal market; those with relatively high    family per capita income and those who resumed their schooling after entering    <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>. We also expect that the longer an individual has    been receiving the family grant, the greater his or her likelihood of attaining    food security.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The control variables    include gender; age group; three dummies for self-reported ethnic belonging    (white, black or brown)<a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a>;    whether the participant is married, is a homeowner, a housewife and has children    under 6 years; the participant's level of formal schooling, income received    from <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>, and his or her region of origin<a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a>.    The results are presented on <a href="#t3">Table 3</a>, which displays both    the full model and the parsimonious model<a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p align="center"><a name="t3"></a></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07t03.jpg"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several considerations    emerge from the probit analysis. First, family per capita income is absolutely    essential for participants to have no concern with the quantity or quality of    their families' diet and their own. An increase of R$20 (or US$ 8.51) in the    beneficiary's per capita income augments in 2.8% the chances of him or her attaining    food security.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, the data    reveal a gender gap. After joining the CCT programme, male beneficiaries have    a 5.7% higher chance of enjoying food security than their female counterparts.    The data indicate that, once a family accesses a slightly greater quantity of    food, male adults are the first ones to eat better (after their children); mothers    and adult females come last. Third, blacks also have difficulties to enjoy food    security; they have a 4.1% lower chance of having enough food than any of the    other racial groups. Afro-Brazilians, who have been traditionally at the bottom    of social pyramid when it comes to other social indicators, have great difficulty    attaining food security. Fourth, another interesting aspect, though, is the    impact of the region of residence of the participants. Beneficiaries from the    South and the Centre-West have a much higher chance - 5.6% and 4.5%, respectively    - of attaining food security than those from the Southeast (the control group).    Conversely, beneficiaries from the poorest regions of Brazil, the North and    the Northeast present lower likelihoods - 4.3% and 5.0%, respectively - of overcoming    food insecurity than those from the control group.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The regional differences    - highlighted by the statistical analysis - point out to the importance of the    point of departure of each of the regions. In the South and Centre-West regions    of Brazil, 70.4% and 64.8% of the participants, respectively, did not have food    security before joining the programme. In the other regions, these numbers were    much higher. Eight in every ten of the participants from the South-East (81.8%)    did not have food security before being admitted into the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>.    In the other two regions, the proportion was nine in every ten: 92.4% in the    North-East and 90.5% in the North. Approximately one-third of the participants    from the South and Centre-West enjoyed food security before receiving the benefit:    these were just marginally poor families, whose low income level qualified them    for the programme, despite the fact that they did not have significant concerns    over access to food or food diversity. Less than 10% of the participants from    the North and Northeast had a similar profile. Thus, it is easier for CCT programmes    to move beneficiaries out of the condition of food insecurity in areas with    a lower contingent of extremely poor individuals and families (such as the South    and Centre-West) than in regions where large proportions of the population experience    extreme poverty (such as the North and Northeast). The testimony from two beneficiaries    illustrates this point. Note that the first BF participant is from a poor area    of the extremely impoverished Northeast; and the second beneficiary resides    in the more economically dynamic South:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Before [entering      the BF program] we would eat much less. There was no bread, coffee; sometimes      we lacked everything: rice, beans The lack of food was more intense for adults.      Sometimes we would eat every other day. It was like that. Now we have pasta,      beans; but at the moment my household lacks [cooking] gas". (Beneficiary from      Raimundo Nonato, Piau&iacute;, Northeast Region).</font></p> </blockquote>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"We never lacked      rice and beans; but with <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> we eat more food. Now      we buy chicken, which we couldn't purchase before. Milk! I had never given      milk to my children; now I buy it for them. Whatever [food items] the children      ask for, now I can pretty much buy them". (Beneficiary from S&atilde;o Carlos,      S&atilde;o Paulo, Southeast region).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These interventions    from the beneficiaries point to at least two important intervening factors in    the analysis of the degree of success of CCT programs. First, the clientele    that they target is incredibly heterogeneous. In one extreme, there are extremely    poor families and individuals for whom hunger is a daily occurrence; in the    other, there are those who have concerns over food availability on the occasions    when they cannot make ends meet. Second, this heterogeneity overlaps, albeit    not perfectly, with significant regional inequalities. Because some regions    carry a larger contingent of extreme poor families and individuals, the success    of the CCT program in some areas will depend to a larger extent on other elements,    such as the dynamism of the local and regional economies (more on this below).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A final important    point is that poor families' level of food insecurity tends to very dynamic.    Those enjoying food security can unexpectedly lack food and face hunger when    they lose income, as when unemployment occurs or when the head of the household    falls ill. Beneficiaries do not have financial resources stashed away for rainy    days; neither do they enjoy labor rights to support them during moments of economic    downturn.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All in all, our    data show that <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> is clearly capable of enabling individuals    and families to overcome food deprivation and to face food scarcity less often.    However, it is much more difficult to rescue those facing severe concerns over    access to food than those just marginally short of obtaining food security.    The fact that Brazil has considerable pockets of extreme poverty makes it difficult    for its CCT program to immediately lift all those families and individuals out    of a condition of severe food insecurity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Does <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>    improve the adults' level of formal education, so as to improve their chances    of securing a job in the market place?

CCT policies    also attempt at improving the situation of the <i>current</i> generation in    ways that go beyond the important goal of attaining food security. The CCT program    in Brazil supports complementary programs that focus on the improvement of the    level of formal schooling for adults and on training for the job market. This    section centers on the analysis of the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s success    in these two areas: a) sending adult beneficiaries back to school and b) helping    them integrate into the job market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, when it    comes to the enabling participants to improve their educational credentials,    <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s record is mixed. On the one hand, 53.3% of the    beneficiaries contemplated going back to school after starting to receive the    CCT benefit. But only 14.9% did so. We ran a probit analysis of the determinants    of going back to school and found that at least five elements are important    in any attempt to improve the human capital of adult beneficiaries<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a>.    First, as <a href="#t4">Table 4</a> shows, the age of the participant is a significant    factor: a beneficiary in the 16-24 age bracket has a 3.1% higher chance of going    back to school than a participant in the 25-34 age group, and so on. Second,    the previous educational level is also extremely important. The overwhelming    majority of <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> beneficiaries have very little formal    schooling: 7.5% of them are illiterate and 58.3% have not finished primary school.    Individuals with a greater level of previous formal schooling have a higher    chance of seeking to improve their educational background than those with little    or no education. The in-depth qualitative interviews corroborate these numbers.    This is the view of two beneficiaries with different educational and age profiles:</font></p>     <p align="center"><a name="t4"></a></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07t04.jpg"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When we get      a little older, we realize how important education is to getting a job. I      completed my first year of high school and now have just gone back to school;      and that was even before being admitted into the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>".      (Beneficiary, from S&atilde;o Carlos, S&atilde;o Paulo, Southeast region).</font></p> </blockquote>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Yeah, I thought      about going back to school. But when the person is older, there are so many      problems with forgetfulness! So forget about it. I really would like to have      studied when I was younger, when the person still has a whole future ahead      of her. For an older person, that is not possible. Now it is my children's      turn. They have studied. I do not want to study at this stage in my life".      (Beneficiary from Macei&oacute;, Alagoas, Northeast region).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Younger participants    and those with a certain level of education clearly see fewer costs and greater    benefits in returning to school than those with a different profile. With a    few more years at school, the former are able to, for instance, complete middle    or high school, which can open up markets for them where there is the possibility    of obtaining a formal job and some labor and social rights. Older individuals    and those with an initial lower level of education, on the other hand, do not    see the same cost-benefit relationship; for them, more years of schooling may    seem to big an investment, especially given the fact that the market for these    individuals is very limited and not in the formal sector of the economy. In    the <a href="#t4">Table 4</a>, as follows, we present a Probit analysis of the    determinants that adult BF recipients will return to school.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The region of residence    is an important factor. There is a greater tendency of participants from the    Southeast (the control group) to go back to school than beneficiaries from other    regions, such as those from the South and Northeast. These differences may be    related to three other factors. First, the job market in the Southeast of Brazil    is more competitive and, hence, demands greater level of formal education. Second,    there is more availability of educational opportunities, such as schools and    training programs sponsored by the private and public sectors. Third, there    is also more availability of public daycares, which enables women to go back    to school. In this last regard, the data show that women have a higher likelihood    (of 5.5%) than men of resuming their educational training (this difference is    statistically significant at p. &lt; 0.6 level).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time in the <i>Bolsa    Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s program is an important factor as well. Every additional    year in the program increases in 1.05% the chance that the beneficiary will    go back to school. This result, along with the fact that homeowners have a higher    tendency of seeking to improve their educational qualifications than those who    do not own their homes, suggests that the return to school is more likely when    participants attain a certain level of stability in life, <i>i.e.</i> when concerns    with, for instance, paying a monthly rent are not present<a name="top19"></a><a href="#back19"><sup>19</sup></a>.    These two findings point to the need of integrated social policies. In other    words, if the goal of CCT policies is to increase human capital among the adult    participants in order to increase the autonomy and well-being of the current    generations, then it is of utmost importance that supplementary programs aimed    at fostering savings towards homeownership, for example, are also in place.    On the other hand, the importance of the time in the program as a determinant,    <i>ceteris paribus</i>, for participants to go back to school raises an important    issue: for how long should each beneficiary stay in the program? <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>    has been criticized in this regard, given that there are no clear timelines    for beneficiaries to leave the CCT program (Draibe 2006). The program's current    design establishes that families should "graduate" from the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>    (<i>i.e.</i> stop receiving the benefit) when they attain a certain level of    stability and that the social agents monitoring the families are the ones responsible    for deciding when that moment occurs. Even though a timeline for participants    to leave the program might be desirable, our data indicate that this approach    is somewhat correct. Myriad factors influence the beneficiaries' decision to    seek their educational betterment, which renders a one-size-fits-all policy    inadequate in this case.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How do <i>Bolsa    Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s beneficiaries fare in the job market? In this regard, descriptive    statistics from our quantitative survey shows some signs of progress, albeit    a modest one. First, between 2004 and 2007, the percentage of BF participants    that were employed (who worked the whole year or most of the year) grew from    51.2% to 55.2%. The proportion of unemployed beneficiaries went down from 47.1%    to 43.5%, which is still a high number. Second, there was also a growth in the    proportion of beneficiaries with formal jobs. It went up from 9.8% in 2004 to    12.5% in 2007. The last number is very revealing. It shows that out of the pool    of beneficiaries with jobs in 2007 (2,155 participants of the quantitative survey),    77.3% of them worked in the informal market. The <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s    beneficiaries who are successful in finding work tend to overwhelming take up    positions that are devoid of social rights, which are usually characterized    by precarious working conditions and low wages. Thus, there is a close association    between poverty and informal work. These are workers that have grown accustomed    to working in the informal sectors of the economy (Sposati 2002, p. 8; Cohen    &amp; Franco 2006, p. 7). When asked about their professional activities and    occupation, these beneficiaries listed primarily daily cleaning (28.8%), street    vending (12.4%), domestic work (6.6%), "collection of recyclables" (4.4%) and    artisanship (4.4%). "Collector of recyclables" refers to individuals who scavenge    garbage dumping sites, dumpsters and even household trash for any recyclable    items that they can gather and resell. "Daily cleaning people" are usually women;    each day they go to a different household to clean it and are paid on a daily    basis. Domestic workers are also as role women, who are employed by a single    household. The latter may or may not be formally registered by their employers.    On this regard, see Blofield (2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What are the determinants    of a <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> beneficiary obtaining a job? We ran a probit    analysis to search for these key explanatory factors between 2004 and 2007.    The results are reported on <a href="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07t05.jpg">Table    5</a>, which only includes the most parsimonious models for each year. Each    complete model had the following independent variables: gender, age group, marital    status, three dummies for race (white, brown and black; others is the control    group); whether the respondent is a homeowner, unemployed, or a housewife; his    or her educational level, per capita family income, and income from <i>Bolsa    Fam&iacute;lia</i>; four dummies for region (the Southeastern region is the    control group); whether the beneficiary has children younger than six years;    the time the participant has been a CCT program beneficiary; and whether he    or she attended professional training courses (coded as 1 = yes and zero otherwise).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data show some    consistency over time in the profile of the beneficiaries who have been successful    in getting a job. First, men have had a much higher probability of finding employment    than women in all these years. This gender gap against women has decreased over    time - it went from 19.5% in 2004, to 16.5% (2005), 15.6% (2006) and 14.9% in    2007 -, but it is still considerable. In order for the CCT programs to be successful    in sending individuals back to the job market, complementary policies need to    be in place, especially those related to the availability of daycares. Without    those, women are still encumbered with a sexual division of domestic work that    prevents them from being active participants in the market place. Simultaneously,    because it does not generate income, domestic work remains undervalued or not    valued at all (Teixeira 2008). In sum, these female beneficiaries who are mothers    and have young children are confined to the position of homecare provider, which    is a clear deterrent to their obtaining a paid position in the market place.    Unless daycares become more available and/or there are more part-time positions    or flexible working hours, the expectation of the CCT policy - that beneficiaries    will integrate into the job market, obtain financial independence and leave    the program - is structurally unrealistic in the case of this particular social    group. Thus, for poor women in a certain phase of their adult life cycle (<i>i.e.</i>    the married housewives with young children) equality of opportunity is non-existent.    In the following <a href="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07t05.jpg">Table 5</a>    we look at the determinants that a BF's beneficiary will obtain a job.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, when it    comes to the racial profile of the beneficiaries who obtain positions in the    market place, blacks and browns are consistently more successful than the beneficiaries    in the control group (those of Asian descent and the indigenous). At least two    considerations are important here. First, it is important to understand that    these results are not at all similar to those found in the Brazilian society    as a whole. In the case of the latter, whites still present overwhelmingly higher    rates of employment in all formal sectors of the economy than non-whites<a name="top20"></a><a href="#back20"><sup>20</sup></a>.    Second, the market in which blacks and browns are successful is the one described    above: informal, which requires low educational level, little or no professional    skills and pays very low wages.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third, the results    for the region dummies indicate that the success of the CCT programs in inserting    beneficiaries in the market place is also dependent upon the dynamism of the    local and regional economies. Between 2004 and 2006, the beneficiaries from    the Center-West had systematically better chances of obtaining a job than those    from the most dynamic region of the country, the Southeast. The opposite happened    to the participants from the Northeast until 2006; the latter were always at    a disadvantage in comparison to their Southeastern counterparts. These numbers    are interesting because they uncover the Achilles' heel of the CCT programs.    One of their key goals - that the adult beneficiaries obtain jobs - depends    upon elements (such as the vitality of the local economies) that are ultimately    beyond the control of social policies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fourth, the unemployed    beneficiaries face an uphill battle. Those who are already employed seem to    be able to meet the demands of the job market and, thus, have a higher chance    of remaining employed. The likelihood of an unemployed participant finding work    became progressively more negative over time. It went up from -17.7% in 2004    to -20.4% in 2005; -24.8% in 2006; and -29.9% in 2007. It remains to be seen    whether these individuals form a permanent "industrial reserve army" or whether    their increasingly lower chances of finding employment is associated with the    economic cycle.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, even though    the results show that the beneficiaries' tenure in the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>    program is not an explanatory factor of the success in entering the job market    (this variable is absent from all the parsimonious models presented in the tables),    it is interesting to note that in 2007 attending professional qualification    courses became an important predictor of a successful employment search. Thus,    factors associated with the inversion sphere - professional qualification of    the beneficiaries - seem now to have become important springboards for them    to land jobs.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All in all, the    <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> beneficiaries did see their rate of unemployment    decrease while in the program. It decreased in 4 percentage points. However,    the rate of unemployment of 43.5% amongst the program's participants in 2007    was still much higher than the rate for the Brazilian population as a whole,    which was 9.3% on that year (Junior 2008).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>VIII. Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Can CCT programs    in general - and <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>, in particular - act to ensure    a less unequal playing field for those at the margins in highly unequal societies?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This study with    beneficiaries of the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> program (BF) in Brazil confirms    what other previous studies have reported on: BF has had a positive impact in    reducing poverty in the country. Hence the main contribution of the present    study is in identifying the main determinants of unequal results among individuals    and families participating in the BF program: why some, but not others, are    more easily able to access the healthcare or to overcome food insecurity while    in the program? Important results from the study are:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, those who    before their participation on PBF were at the margins have now been able to    access healthcare services on a more regular basis. Thus, the women at the margins    who were systematically excluded - black women, poorly educated and from the    North - now, after their participation in the CCT program, have more access    to prenatal care and can now count with a greater availability of public healthcare    network.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, before    entering the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> program, 50.3% of the participants    faced severe food insecurity. This number went down to 36.8% in very five years.    Men are more likely than women; non-blacks more likely than blacks; and South    and Centre-West residents more likely than Brazilians from other regions; to    become food secure while participating in BF. Thus, there is no denying that    the concern with the well-being of the future generations is being addressed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third, relevant    statistic relates that there has been no reduction in adult employment among    beneficiaries. This point should be emphasized, because a central critique of    cash transfer programs is that they are a disincentive to work.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, that moment    in 2008, a small proportion of the adult participants indeed were able to return    to school and to increase their educational qualifications. The lack of technical    skills and the huge predominance of informal employment are central social problems    in Brazil and that the PBF has failed to address such issues.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ultimate, <i>Bolsa    Fam&iacute;lia</i> has been successful in addressing the needs of the future    generations with a view to breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty,    its results when it comes to the current generation are more mixed. Until 2008,    Brazilian CCT programs represented an insufficient type of state intervention.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, at    present, in order to lift the adult participants out of poverty and to create    a more level playing field for them, the national and local governments have    being at the forefront; to be able to stimulate the local economies. Also, across    the country, more particularly in the poorer regions, BFP beneficiaries have    access to courses for professional training and receive more money as an incentive    to take the course. In order poor adults, such as the woman below, are able    to fulfill their most precious dream:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I will enroll      in a course on wall painting. I believe that with that course I will be able      to try to get a construction job. The biggest dream of my life is to have      a formal job before I am forty".</font></p> </blockquote>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Adato, M.; Basett,    L. 2009.

The survey is based on a stratified    national sample of 4,000 interviewees, with margin of error of 4%.    <br>   <a name="back2"></a><a href="#top2">2</a> This article will not analyze the    level of school attendance among the children of the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s    participants. The quantitative survey did not have questions about this topic.    Given that schools send the information on school attendance directly to the    CCT program, some parents are unable to give precise information regarding their    children's school attendance.    <br>   <a name="back3"></a><a href="#top3">3</a> Among <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>'s    clientele there are individuals just marginally below the line of poverty as    well as those who struggle daily to find food. There are not precise measurements    of extreme poverty in the literature and we don't seek to create one in the    scope of this article - even though we are aware of the presence of extreme    poor families and individuals among the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia-</i> beneficiaries.    <br>   <a name="back4"></a><a href="#top4">4</a> There is a lot of controversy over    where exactly the poverty line should fall or whether it should exist at all.    See, among others, Oster, Lake and Oksman (1978), Sen (1999) and Vuollo <i>et    al.</i> (2004).    <br>   <a name="back5"></a><a href="#top5">5</a> For an analysis on intergenerational    persistence of income inequality, see Blandel <i>et al.</i> (2004).    <br>   <a name="back6"></a><a href="#top6">6</a> Furthermore, in countries such as    Brazil and Argentina, the expansion of social rights took place under a corporatist    framework, <i>i.e.</i>, social rights were extended to those who worked in the    formal sector of the economy. Consequently, the rural poor in these countries    never enjoyed the social rights that their countries' constitutions deemed to    be universal. See Horowitz (1999).    <br>   <a name="back7"></a><a href="#top7">7</a> Sewall (2008) argues that measures    such as the direct distribution of resources from the central government to    the recipient can reduce clientelism. Nevertheless, she cautions that central    governments can profit electorally from these policies, when, they expand the    program (<i>e.g.</i> either the amount of money that participants receive or    the sheer number of beneficiaries) right before the elections.    <br>   <a name="back8"></a><a href="#top8">8</a> Menezes Filho and Landim Jr. (2009,    p. A9) show that in 2006 whereas the <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> program cost    R$ 7.5 billion, it generated an extra R$12.6 billion in taxes for municipalities.    <br>   <a name="back9"></a><a href="#top9">9</a> For the numbers on the Nicaraguan    case and on the Mexican counterpart, see Barham and Maluccio (2009, p. 612).    <br>   <a name="back10"></a><a href="#top10">10</a> Healthcare is free in Brazil. However,    public healthcare by and large offers low-quality service. There is a scarcity    of health facilities; the existing public hospitals are always overcrowded and    understaffed. Thus, middle class and more affluent Brazilians resort to private    health care, which gives them access to the best hospitals and services.    <br>   <a name="back11"></a><a href="#top11">11</a> There is a great regional disparity    in Brazil. The South presents high levels of human development. The overpopulated    cities of the Southeast present high levels of economic development, but also    a considerable degree of urban poverty. The North and the Northeast have high    levels of extreme poverty. Center-West has moderate levels of human development.    <br>   <a name="back12"></a><a href="#top12">12</a> In fact, most of the women who    reported not having done prenatal care pointed to the lack of healthcare facility    in their areas of residence as the key factor in the non-compliance. However,    there is a clear generational aspect in the answer. Over one-third of the older    women list this factor as the key obstacle, whereas only 1.2% of the younger    women (between 16 and 24 years) mention this problem.    <br>   <a name="back13"></a><a href="#top13">13</a> The scales varies from 0 to 3.    The Appendix shows the questions and values assigned to each answer.    <br>   <a name="back14"></a><a href="#top14">14</a> These variables have been coded    as follows: (a) unemployed = 1 (zero, otherwise); (b) working in the informal    sector = 1 (zero, otherwise) and (c) beneficiary went back to school = 1 (zero,    otherwise).    <br>   <a name="back15"></a><a href="#top15">15</a> The control group is composed by    individuals of Asian and indigenous descent.    <br>   <a name="back16"></a><a href="#top16">16</a> These variables have been coded    as follows: (a) male = 1 (female = 0); (b) ethnic belonging (white or black    or brown) = 1 (zero, otherwise); (c) married participant = 1 (zero, otherwise);    (d) homeowner = 1 (zero, otherwise); (e) participant has children under 6 years    = 1 (zero, otherwise); (f) dummies for region (South or Centre-West or North    or North-East) = 1 (zero, otherwise).    <br>   <a name="back17"></a><a href="#top17">17</a> We also show the probabilities    calculated using the command 'dprobit' from STATA. Essentially, these numbers    show the probabilities stemming from the discrete change in the dummy variable    from 0 to 1. Please note that, but for per capita income, all independent variables    of the parsimonious model are dummies.    <br>   <a name="back18"></a><a href="#top18">18</a> Independent variables: (<i>i</i>)    marital status (married = 1; otherwise = 0); (<i>ii</i>) if the respondent is    a homeowner, unemployed, or a housewife, the value equals to 1 (otherwise =    0); (<i>iii</i>) income from <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i> is the raw number in    Brazilian Re-als; (<i>iv</i>) if the beneficiary has children younger than six    years = 1 (otherwise = 0); and (<i>v</i>) the time the participant has been    a CCT program beneficiary.    <br>   <a name="back19"></a><a href="#top19">19</a> Most homeowners buy their houses    without resorting to mortgages. Furthermore, poor families and individuals live    in slums (where they have housing but have not necessarily purchased a home).    <br>   <a name="back20"></a><a href="#top20">20</a> In 2003, for instance, the rate    of unemployment for whites was 10.6% and for non-whites was 14.4%. Furthermore,    the wage gap is also substantial: as of March 2009, non-whites earned, on average,    R$ 847,71, whereas whites received, on average, R$ 1,663.88. These are the IBGE's    (Brazilian Census Bureau's) official numbers cited in Junior (2009).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Appendix</b></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><a name="apt1"></a></p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rsocp/v22n51/07apt01.jpg"></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

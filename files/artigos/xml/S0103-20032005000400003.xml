<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>I. Introduction</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Habitat conservation can be justified on instrumental or intrinsic grounds. The instrumental approach seeks ways to finance conservation of habitats that perform particular "bankable" services such as watershed protection or carbon storage (see e.g. Pagiola, Bishop and Landell-Mills 2002). If successful, this approach will create incentives to preserve some, but not all, habitats. It will promote conservation of moist hillside forests, for instance, and tend to neglect dry forests on plains&#151;even if the latter contain unique biological features.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An alternative approach assumes a moral imperative character to preserve viable examples of every type of natural habitat. Arguing from a well-established log-log relationship between habitat area and number of species, conservation biologists sometimes advocate a goal of retaining a fixed proportion &#150; ten percent or more &#151; of each habitat type (Soul&eacute; and Sanjayan 1998). In many areas, this goal will not be met without active interventions to protect habitats from agricultural expansion. The costs of these interventions will vary widely, depending on agricultural potential and opportunities. In the developing world, the opportunity cost of conservation may be a few hundred dollars per hectare where the alternative is extensive pasture management or thousands of dollars where the alternative is a high-value perennial crop.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In principle, a transferable development right (TDR) program can minimize the social cost of achieving a target for area conserved, and can reward those undertaking conservation. Such programs have been used on a small scale in the U.S. to preserve farmland and natural areas (Johnston and Madison 1997). On a larger scale, a government could allocate development or conversion rights (denominated in hectares) equivalent to 80 percent of a particular habitat. Trading of these rights would tend to allow conversion of the plots most suitable for agriculture, and retention under natural vegetation of the areas with the lowest opportunity cost. If the rights were freely and equally allocated among property holders (a fiscally inefficient but politically expedient procedure) those who maintained forests would profit from TDR sales. A TDR program is thus the conservation analog of environmental permit programs that regulate air pollution or fisheries access.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The implementers    of a TDR program focusing specifically on biodiversity representation face a    crucial practical problem: defining equivalence between habitats in different    locations.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a> The most natural    way to do this in a TDR system is to define zones of equivalence: within each    zone, habitat is considered equivalent and substitutable. Science can provide    input to this policy issue, but cannot decide it. Forests (or other habitats)    can be classified according to a detailed taxonomic hierarchy. Environmental    policymakers may differ in their views on how far down the hierarchy to go in    determining equivalence. "Lumpers" will favor equivalence within high level    classifications, allowing substitutability among all neotropical forests, for    instance. "Splitters" of different degrees of rigor will favor restricting forest    substitutability to finer classifications; for instance, particular types of    neotropical forests (e.g., moist neotropical rainforests), forest subtypes based    on unique assemblages of species and communities (e.g. the Atlantic Rainforest    of Brazil), forests within particular watersheds, or at the limit, forests within    a particular microwatershed of a few thousand hectares. Choice of the appropriate    level involves a trade-off between the efficiency gains offered by a broad classification,    and the potentially greater representation of biodiversity offered by a fine    classification. (Consideration of environmental goals other than biodiversity,    such as maintenance of hydrological processes, would complicate the trade-off.)</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This issue is of    particular relevance to Brazil, where TDR-like programs are emerging. The Forest    Code of 1965 (and indeed its precursor of 1934) requires each landowner to maintain    a proportion of each property under natural vegetation as a legal forest reserve.    The proportion ranges from 20 percent in southern Brazil to 80 percent in the    Legal Amazon<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Provisional    regulation (<i>Medida Provisoria</i>) 2166-67 of 2001, the operative current    rule, allows landholders to satisfy the requirement for one property through    legal forest reserve located on another. In some cases, the off-site legal reserve    may be owned by another party, opening the way to a market in legal reserve    rights. (Note that the legal reserve is distinct from, and augments, the required    areas of permanent preservation: forests along streams, on steep slopes, and    on hilltops).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many properties are out of compliance with the legal reserve obligation. Consequently, increased enforcement of the law has led to interest in policies that would permit trade of legal reserve obligations. These would allow landholders with insufficient legal reserve to purchase offsetting reserves at a different site. Such policies immediately raise the question of whether the scope of allowed offsets should be restricted to the same microbasin, or whether a wide scope should be allowed.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper uses a simulation model to examine the impacts of alternative trading scopes on landholder compliance cost and on protection of areas of biodiversity interest. It uses data for the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, an innovator in the use of economic instruments for conservation. It significantly extends an earlier paper (Chomitz 2004) through improved measures of land value, finer geographic resolution, and a wider range of impact measures. While we believe that the results are indicative, we stress that this paper is not intended as an authoritative analysis for Minas Gerais. However, we hope that with further refinements, the model presented here could allow policymakers and stakeholders in Minas Gerais, in Brazil, and beyond to explore options and issues in policy design.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next section    describes the current situation in Minas Gerais and Brazil. The third presents    a stylized model illustrating the potential economic and environmental impacts    of instituting alternative TDR schemes. The fourth section operationalizes the    model. Section five presents our results with some discussion. A concluding    section discusses policy implications, with some attention to institutional    issues such as the transactions cost and competitiveness in a market for legal    reserve obligations.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>II. Brazilian    and Minas Gerais context</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1965, Brazilian landholders have been obliged to keep a specified proportion of each property under natural vegetation. Currently, this "legal forest reserve" requirement is 20 percent in southern states&#151;where much forest cover has been lost&#151;and is 80 percent in the forest-biome (e.g., non-savanna) areas of the Legal Amazon. Proprietors may use the legal reserve area for limited purposes, including sustainable extraction, but may not clear-cut it. The legal reserve requirement augments another regulation which places under "permanent protection" forested areas on hills or bordering streams and rivers.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enforcing compliance with the legal reserve regulation is challenging in some southern states, where aggregate forest cover has been lost as a result of centuries of agricultural expansion, with much deforestation occurring in recent decades. In many locales, aggregate forest cover has dropped well below the 20 percent limit because of profitable opportunities to cultivate soybeans, vegetables, coffee, or other crops. Strict enforcement of the legal reserve requirement would be extremely expensive in these locales if landholders were required to abandon cropland or perennials. In heavily-worked properties with little remaining natural vegetation, the rate and quality of natural regeneration might be extremely slow. The isolated and poor-quality stands of regenerated vegetation would provide little biodiversity benefit. In other locales, some forest fragments persist. Often, these fragments represent the last vestiges of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a biome which is now reduced to about 7 percent of its original area and consequently harbors important biodiversity found nowhere else (Myers et al 2000). In Minas Gerais, the Atlantic Forest in 2000 had shrunk to 14.5% of its original area, with an annual deforestation rate of more than 0.5% (Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o SOS Mata Atl&acirc;ntica and INPE 2002). These fragments represent the candidates for nuclei of a regenerated forest, because of the potential to serve as genetic sources for endangered plants and animals. Yet deforestation continues in these forest fragments because returns to agricultural conversion and timber extraction exceed the private benefits of forest maintenance. The legal reserve regulation, by itself, would permit deforestation down to the 20 percent limit, though special regulations restrict deforestation in the Atlantic Forest zone.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In short, strict property-by-property enforcement of the legal reserve limit might be ecologically and economically inefficient in already-deforested regions. Property-wise enforcement would impose large compliance costs on profitable farms, with little environmental gain. Property-wise enforcement would fail to provide incentives to maintain and expand the precious remaining areas of primary habitat.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consequently, as    the enforcement efforts were stepped up in the late 1990s, there was increased    attention to mechanisms that would allow out-of-compliance landholders to meet    their legal reserve limits offsite. In the municipality of Araguar&iacute;,    in the state of Minas Gerais, local prosecutors in 1997 allowed groups of coffee    farmers, with no remaining forest on their properties, to form a "condominium"    to purchase and preserve a large forested property (Bernardes 1999). In 1998,    a precursor of Medida Provis&oacute;ria 2166-67 permitted similar "compensation"    procedures. The current regulation contains a provision that specifies that    compensation take place within the same microbasin if possible; and if not,    in the same river basin and state<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a>.    In 2001, Goi&aacute;s State issued implementing regulations allowing off-site    legal reserve compensation. In 2002, Minas Gerais adopted a new state forest    code, which allows for trading of legal reserve within a microbasin, but allows    for some forms of legal reserve offset within a river basin. A more elaborate    system of legal reserve enforcement and trading, SISLEG, was put in place in    2000 in the state of Paran&aacute;. Each property in the state was required    to come into compliance with the legal reserve requirement by the end of 2018.    The regulation permitted compliance through on-site regeneration, with forested    property of the same owner, or with forested property of a different owner.    Cross-property compensation was allowed within one of ten zones defined on the    basis of river basins &#150; a relatively wide scope. However, SISLEG was discontinued    in 2003, after which compensation rules were made more restrictive.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Forest reserve maintenance is particularly relevant to Minas Gerais. After suffering substantial forest loss, the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais has become an innovator in forest conservation. Over the past 50 years, forests in this large territory have been cleared to accommodate agricultural expansion and to fuel the state's charcoal-fired iron mills. Forest loss has been particularly severe in the Atlantic Forest region of the state, in the areas near the blast furnaces, and in the fertile "Triangulo" region in the west. In response, during the 1990's the state adopted two major conservation initiatives: a ban on the use of native forests for iron production, and a revenue-sharing system that rewarded municipalities for creating and maintaining protected areas. Nonetheless, parks and reserves constitute only 0.9% of the state's territory; another 2.3% of the territory is in multiple-use with some degree of environmental zoning (Costa et al., 1998). Management of legal forest reserves on private lands is therefore of great significance to the state's overall forest estate.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#fig1">Figure    1</a> shows remaining forest cover on private agricultural lands, based on municipality-level    tabulations from the agricultural census of 1995/96 (IBGE 1998). The state is    divided into four biomes, the major ones being the Atlantic Forest to the east,    the "cerrado" or savanna to the west, and the "caatinga" in the drier north    (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Remaining forest cover is below 20% in most    of the Atlantic Forest biome and in the agroclimatically favorable portions    of the cerrado, to the south and west. Higher forest cover remains in the more    arid and remote regions of the cerrado and caatinga. Average land values (<a href="#fig3">Figure    3</a>) are, not surprisingly, inversely related to forest cover<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><a name="fig1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v43n4/27750f1.gif"></p>     ]]></body>

A simple    model of the application of a TDR scheme to forest regeneration</b></font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In areas with inadequate    forest cover, the TDR scheme is a device to encourage protection of existing    forest and regeneration of new forest. To evaluate its efficiency and effectiveness    in doing so, we introduce a highly stylized model. Initially, a landholder has    a property with total area <i>T</i>, of which <i>A<sub>0</sub></i> is in agriculture    and <i>F<sub>0</sub></i> in forest. Then, a regulation is introduced (or enforced)    requiring the landholder to set aside a proportion <font face="Symbol">j</font>    of her property as forest reserve, first from existing forest, and then if necessary    by abandoning cultivated land and pasture to forest regrowth. Let <i>g(x)</i>    represent the total value of the most valuable x hectares of cultivated land,    and <i>h(x)</i> the total value of the most valuable x hectares of forest land.    We assume that these values are exogenously determined by agricultural product    markets. We make the drastic assumption that forest reserve has no private value    due to restrictions on use<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>.    Then compliance with the regulation costs the landholder:</font></p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v43n4/27750s1.gif"></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regrowth occurs    entirely on properties with low initial forest cover. Because these properties    are likely to be the most productive and heavily worked, compliance costs are    high and the quality of regenerated forest likely to be low, due to compacted    soil, nutrient depletion, and absence of seed sources <a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now suppose that    landholders are allowed to sell forest reserve rights attached to 'excess' forest    (that is, forest areas in excess of <font face="Symbol">j</font><i>T</i>) and    that those with forest reserve deficits may purchase these rights and apply    them to their own reserve obligations. This creates a market for forest reserve    with market-clearing price p. The landholder's problem is to satisfy the legal    reserve requirement by choosing an agricultural abandonment area 0 <u>&lt;</u>    <i>a</i> <u>&lt;</u><i> A<sub>0</sub>,</i> an on-site forest set-aside area    0 <u>&lt;</u> <i>f </i><u>&lt;</u><i>F<sub>0</sub></i> and a net legal reserve    purchase area q (q&lt;0 implies a sale of legal reserve rights) to maximize:</font></p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v43n4/27750s2.gif"></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">subject to :</font></p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v43n4/27750s3.gif"></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The maximization problem will differ between forest-deficit and forest surplus properties, depending on some additional assumptions about allowable transactions.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Forest-deficit    properties.</i> First consider the response of properties where <i>F<sub>0</sub>    -</i><font face="Symbol">j</font><i>T &lt;0</i>.

Areas favorable to agriculture will have distinct biota, but will tend to have low remaining forest cover and high land value. Demand for reserve rights will be high, but few properties will have surplus forest with which to supply that demand. Suppose on the other hand that land values are determined mainly by road access, and that there is substantial variation in road access within biologically homogenous areas.

Areas with relatively high forest cover are likely to be areas where agricultural potential, and hence land values, are low. (It is for this reason that the forest is still standing.) Hence the derived supply and demand functions are likely to differ systematically from the true functions, with less supply at low prices and less demand at high prices.

In the baseline scenario, these ecologically valuable areas are allowed to degrade down to the 20 percent limit, while areas that are already severely degraded are allowed to present very poor-quality regeneration to fulfill their reserve requirement. (The regeneration in these areas is likely to be poor because seed sources are lacking and the land has been heavily worked). In the program scenario, standing forest is conserved, and regrowth is encouraged near the forest, where seed sources are plentiful, and the opportunity to reconnect forest fragments is greater. This should lead to higher biomass and carbon densities and to ecosystems better to support minimum viable populations of flora and fauna.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To compute biodiversity    impacts, municipality-level impacts were proportionately allocated to biodiversity    priority areas that overlapped with the municipality (Unfortunately the census-tract    level data was not spatially referenced.)</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>V.

Within each of the geographic trading regimes,    two sub-scenarios are simulated. In 'forest only', forest surplus properties    may sell permits based only on existing 'excess' forest. In the 'forest first'    scenarios, forest surplus properties may also sell permits from abandonment    and regrowth on agricultural plots, but only after selling all available permits    based on standing forest.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

All of this is assumed to become low quality regeneration. The municipality-level trading scenarios offer negligible reductions in total compliance cost, as within-municipality trading opportunities are few. (This reflects to some degree the assumption of homogenous land prices, for a given land use type, within municipalities, but also the observed infrequency of coexisting forest-deficit and forest-surplus census tracts within the same municipality.) For the biome-basin scenario, however, trading makes a difference. In the forest-only sub-scenario, total compliance costs decline by R$256 million relative to the command and control scenario. Forest-deficit properties capture about 45% of this saving. The rest goes to forest-surplus properties, which sell permits based on 346,000 forest hectares placed under new protection, and 250,000 hectares already protected (in theory) by regulations forbidding Atlantic Forest deforestation. In the forest-first sub-scenario of biome-basin trading, there is a further reduction of R$220 million in the social costs of compliance. The bulk of this accrues to the forest-deficit landholders, who now abandon only 1,745,000 hectares, purchasing permits from 977 thousand hectares of regenerating forest in favorable areas. Compared to the forest-only sub-scenario, new protection of existing forest drops from 346 thousand to 175 thousand hectares.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the final pair of scenarios, trading is permitted throughout a biome. The forest-only variant shows relatively little difference in the land cover mix from biome-basin trading: newly protected forest increases in area from 346 thousand to 455 thousand hectares. But by exploiting cross-basin (but within-biome) differences in land value, the biome-wide trading scenario reduces costs by an additional R$284 million compared to biome-basin. Finally, compliance costs are drastically reduced in the final scenario, the forest-first variant of biome-wide trading. Compared to the command-and-control scenario, total opportunity costs are reduced by over R$1 billion, most of which accrues to forest-deficit landholders. The savings accompanies a massive shift of 1.7 million hectares from land under low-quality regeneration to land under high-quality regeneration. Compared to the forest-only variant of biome-wide trading, this environmental benefit is slightly offset by a decline in new protection of standing forest, from 455 hectares to 275 thousand hectares. Forest-surplus landholders realize reduced aggregate profits from permit sales in the forest-first variant, despite the much greater hectarage of permits delivered.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#fig4">Figure    4</a> summarizes the main results, showing only the forest-first variants. Expansion    of the trading ambit results in substantial social savings; both forest-deficit    and forest-surplus landholders benefit as the ambit expands. Wider trading also    results in a better overall quality of new additions to the forest reserve system.    Under command-and-control, the new reserves are entirely composed of low-quality    regeneration. Much of this area will regenerate weakly, if at all, yielding    little biodiversity or carbon sequestration benefit. Under biome-wide trading,    low-quality regeneration is reduced to just 29% of the expanded reserve area.    This almost certainly implies some gain in carbon sequestration and improvement    in biodiversity-friendly habitat. But does expansion of the trading ambit lead    to poor targeting or poor geographical balance in the biodiversity benefits?</font></p>     <p><a name="fig4"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v43n4/27750f4.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While enforcement    of command-and-control protects an additional 486 thousand hectares of poor-quality    regenerating land in biodiversity priority areas, biome-basin trading protects    668 thousand new hectares in these areas (of which 427 thousand is standing    forest or high quality regeneration) and biome-wide trading protects 884 thousand    new hectares in biodiversity priority areas, mostly high-quality. <a href="#fig5">Figures    5</a> and <a href="#fig6">6</a> show how the geographic distribution of high    quality forest (i.e., existing, and high quality regeneration) differs between    biome-basin trading, and biome-wide trading. Biome-wide trading has large beneficial    impacts on forest extent in the north and east of the state, both inside and    outside biodiversity priority areas. Biome-basin trading yields superior results    only in some small corners of the southwestern portion of the state. In this    fertile agricultural area, permit prices soar to over R$1100 per hectare when    trading is restricted to the biome-basin combination, eliciting some supply    from the few remaining forest-surplus tracts.</font></p>     ]]></body>

Discussion    and conclusions</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The simulation results show that a tradeable legal reserve program could dramatically reduce the opportunity costs of protecting and regenerating a desired aggregate level of forest cover, when the trading scope extends beyond the strictly local area (e.g. municipality or micro-watershed). Trading beyond the local level also results in superior environmental results, including greater protection of existing forest remnants, and encouragement of higher-quality regeneration. These outcomes should be better both for biodiversity and for carbon sequestration. These results may be generalized to other forest-poor areas, since they follow from the strong association between favorable agroclimatic and market access conditions, high prior levels of forest conversion, and high land values, and high degrees of spatial autocorrelation in all these variables (Chomitz <i>et al</i> 2004).</font></p>      ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reduction in opportunity costs is important not just from the viewpoint of economic efficiency, but perhaps more importantly, from a political economy viewpoint. Much of the cost reductions would potentially accrue to large landholders in rich agricultural regions. But benefits also accrue to landholders in less prosperous regions who have protected their forests, and to agricultural workers. Together this builds a powerful constituency for instituting the program. Conversely, there would be little support for a command-and-control program that imposed costs on these stakeholder groups.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How far trading    scopes should be extended? There cannot be a definitive answer, as the tradeoffs    will be sensitive to the spatial covariance of biological distinctiveness and    agricultural attractiveness &#150; and to decisions about how to share the costs    of conservation. But the results shown here suggest that wider ambits deserve    serious attention &#150; at least in the context where forests are already depleted    in high-market-value areas. Here the wider ambit offers much greater aggregate    environmental benefits and much greater social savings. The savings are large    enough that a small portion could be used to finance targeted interventions    (such as purchase of land for parks) in ecosystems that might otherwise be underrepresented.    Similar considerations apply when considering whether to allow permit supply    only from standing forest, or also from regeneration. Similarly, extending the    trading regime to allow supply of permits from high-quality regeneration 'crowds    out' a small amount of protection of standing forest, but stimulates the creation    of a much greater extent of restored forest, while realizing considerable savings.    Again, in principle, some of the savings could be devoted to targeted acquisition    of standing forest in underrepresented ecosystems.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Could such a system work in practice? Practical operation of a trading system requires a transparent, trustworthy institution that minimizes low transactions and monitoring costs, and avoids collusion or market manipulation. Market manipulation is a worry especially for markets with small ambits, where buyers may be few but powerful in both political and economic spheres. Transactions costs are potentially a problem if buyers must seek out sellers in a thin market, and if buyers retain liability for compliance on a distant property. Monitoring and enforcement costs could be high if tens or hundreds of thousands of properties have to be inspected.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here we sketch an approach to overcoming these problems. First, the problems of thin or imperfect markets represent another argument against small ambits. Large ambits bring in larger numbers of participants, reducing opportunities for collusion and increasing market liquidity. Second, we assume that each landholder is responsible for the integrity of all legal reserve services provided on-site, including services sold to others. We assume that the state government will monitor compliance &#150; as it would have to, in any case, under a command and control system. Each landholder reports the area of owned property, the area of legal reserve maintained on site, the amount of legal reserve sold, and the amount of legal reserve purchased. The state inspects all very large properties, which are few in number but contain a large proportion of all area. The state does randomized audits of self-reported data from smaller properties, with penalties for false reporting. This minimizes monitoring costs. Third, since within-ambit markets deal in a homogeneous commodity, auctions would be an efficient way to transfer legal reserve rights. This would be especially apt if the main reason for the market is to allow landowners with insufficient forest to come into compliance. Buyers and sellers would submit sealed bids to a central clearinghouse, which would check validity of offered legal reserve against the official state records &#150; presumed to be computerized. The clearinghouse would compute the market-clearing price, exactly in the manner used in this paper's simulation, debit the sellers' holdings, and credit the buyers' holdings in the state database. This obviates the need for bilateral transactions and greatly reduces transactions costs.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Are such programs    feasible in places that lack Brazil's tradition of a quantitative conservation    requirement for every landholder? Certainly the existence of that tradition    makes it easier to reach consensus on an initial allocation of permits. But    it may also be possible to agree on such a rule in areas where forests have    been widely cut despite legal prohibitions; or in forest-rich regions where    publicly owned lands are only now coming under development pressure. In any    case, the evolution of TDR-like systems in Brazil alone is reason enough for    serious policy and research attention to the issue. Refinement of the model    presented here &#150; with finer spatial detail on land values, more realistic    modeling of 'business as usual' land use trends, and ecologically-informed modeling    of the vigor of natural regeneration &#151; could help to inform public discussion    and decisions on legal reserve trading and related policies.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>VII.

<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recebido em abril    de 2005 e revisto em setembro de 2005</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are grateful    to IBGE for providing us with unpublished census-tract level tabulations of    land cover, and to Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Getulio Vargas for providing the land    value data. We have benefited greatly from discussions with and background material    assembled by Ivana Lamas, Cl&aacute;udia Costa, Luis Carlos Cardoso Vale, and    Jos&eacute; Roberto Soareas Scolforo. Aline Bernardes and Peter May provided    useful comments and assistance. Preparation of this paper was supported by the    Global Overlay Program, the Research Support Board, and by Norwegian assistance    to the World Development Report 2003. However, the contents of this paper are    solely the responsibility of the authors, and should not be attributed to the    World Bank, its Board of Executive Directors, or the countries they represent.    <a href="mailto:kchomitz@worldbank.org">kchomitz@worldbank.org</a>    <br>   <a name="back1"></a><a href="#top1">1</a>    It has similarly proved difficult to operationalize wetland equivalence for    the application of compensatory schemes for wetland mitigation. There, the problem    is commensurating a wide range of distinct hydrological and biological functions.    See Whigham 1999 and National Research Council 2001.    <br>   <a name="back2"></a><a href="#top2">2</a>    Landholders are additionally required to maintain vegetation in areas of permanent    preservation, which include riverbanks and slopes.    <br>   <a name="back3"></a><a href="#top3">3</a>    <i>Medida Provis&oacute;ria</i> 2166-67, 24 August 2001 is the most recent version.    <br>   <a name="back4"></a><a href="#top4">4</a>    This is true in part by construction. Mean land values are computed as the weighted    average of prices according to land class, with forest often being the least    valuable class.    <br>   <a name="back5"></a><a href="#top5">5</a>    Think of the value of existing, non-reserved forest as representing the sum    of option values for agricultural use and the value of standing timber if liquidated    immediately. This value may be large relative to the present value of a stream    of sustainable forest harvests, particularly from newly regenerating forest.    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<br>   <a name="back6"></a><a href="#top6">6</a>    This generalization may not apply to areas under perennial crops or plantations,    some of which may revert easily to forest if abandoned.    <br>   <a name="back7"></a><a href="#top7">7</a>    Chomitz <i>et al</i> used the hedonic equation to impute a land value surface    for south Bahia. Equivalent data were not available for the current exercise,    but we do not believe that more refined land value data would have made a qualitative    difference in the results.    <br>   <a name="back8"></a><a href="#top8">8</a>    We assume that such abandonment satisfies regulations, regardless of the actual    quality of subsequent natural regeneration.    <br>   <a name="back9"></a><a href="#top9">9</a>    Despite this law 2.8% of the remaining Atlantic Forest in Minas Gerais was deforested    over 1995-2000 according to a remote sensing-based study (SOS Mata Atl&acirc;ntica    and Institute Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, 2002)</font></p>      ]]></body><back>

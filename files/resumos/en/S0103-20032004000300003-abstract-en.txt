The objective of the present work is to show and to discuss a method of identification of production systems divided in two stages. In the first one it was used focal groups and in the second the discriminant analysis was used to validate the results gotten in the group interviews. The advantage of this method is the exploitation of the impressions from who interacts with the different production systems (farms and other operating professionals in the studied agricultural region) and intuitively knows how to differentiate them. The method was applied in the identification of production systems of coffee for the region of Maril√≠a of the State of Sao Paulo. The results had indicated the predominance of three distinct systems: "coffee monoculture", "coffee and cattle" and small diversified farm".

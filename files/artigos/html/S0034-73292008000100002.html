Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The aim of this study is to analyze how the Brazilian    public administration confronted the challenges arising from the globalization    process after the end of the Cold War. With focus on the case of Brazilian foreign    policy, it is found that the post- Cold War period implied an erosion of state-centeredness    due to the strengthening of new kind of inter- and transnational 'spheres of    authority' (SOA). Most of the literature about states and globalization is generally    concerned with entities dealing with economic or social issues. In this study    special attention is given to "diplomacy", which although highly related to    globalization, is generally not scrutinized in this context. Through a study    of changes in Brazilian foreign policy organization, particular attention will    be given on how periphery states adapt to the new global structures. The perspective    of this study follows the line of research which views states as increasingly    'transnationalized' organizations and that this has effects on national administration.    However, it is important to make clear that our main interest is not in foreign    policy as such, but in how it is organized. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A pillar of International Relations (IR) theory    has traditionally been to think in 'Westphalian' terms, with the state-centric    perspective as a key pillar. However, after the fall of the Soviet block, this    pillar was challenged. Pundits, such as Robert D. Putnam stipulated that state-centric    literature was an uncertain foundation for theorizing about how domestic and    international politics interact<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><sup>1</sup></a>.    Others have gone even further, arguing that such a state-centered approach was    imprisoned by the idea that the line between domestic and foreign affairs still    serves as the cutting edge of analysis<a name="tx02"></a><a href="#nt02"><sup>2</sup></a>. This worldview recasts the    relevance of 'territoriality', highlighting instead the 'porosity of boundaries'.    Instead of a state-centric predominance, there is now a complex multi-centric    world creating structures, processes, and rules of its own, that Putnam calls    'spheres of authority' (SOA). There is a steady increase in research pointing    out non state-centred sources of rule making. Some of these regulators are states    or connected to states, but some are more loosely connected or even not connected    to states at all. New systemic requirements have emerged since Peter Evans and    colleagues published their book, <I>Bringing the State Back In</I><a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><sup>3</sup></a>.    For example, there has been an increasing amount of links among states through    regional and global institutions, creating new inter-sectoral contact points    among governmental units. That is particularly evident in the economic domain,    where there is an increasing intersection with traditionally diplomatic domains,    leading some authors to speak about 'economic diplomacy'<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><sup>4</sup></a>. All these    changes affect the traditional work of national diplomatic service. Yet, in    spite of all that is written about globalization, as well as about reforming    the state, there is still scant research about the links between both issues.    This is particularly true when it comes to states in periphery countries.</font></p>     <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us now concentrate on sketching some of    the elements to be used as general guidelines for analyzing Brazilian foreign    policy organization. Among Latin American countries, the Brazilian case is particularly    interesting since this country has taken a very active role at the global level,    becoming one of the most outspoken 'emerging countries'. Brazil has also been    a leading actor in Latin American processes of regional integration. Notwithstanding    lines of continuity in foreign policy, Brazil has been, as all countries, conditioned    constrained by internal and external room of maneuver. Organizational changes    happen all the time, but the hypothesis of this study is that the challenges    from globalization have brought about particular changes affecting the way of    structuring national organizations. Specifically, this study will analyze how    Itamaraty, as a national foreign policy organization, responded to the increased    national pervasiveness of international organizations and the creation of new    multi-level contact points. Much of this can be observed through the local impact    of so-called 'global issues', such as the Environment, Human Rights or Trade.    There is also a new mix of policy areas, where economic, political or cultural    themes are increasingly intertwined. Furthermore, it is relevant to analyze    the extent to which the new national/international linkage leads to a 'new regionalism'<a name="tx05"></a><a href="#nt05"><sup>5</sup></a>    as a way of coping with globalization. This means, for example, analyzing the    way in which regional entities are institutionalizing novel forms of actorhood,    through which states intend to confront globalization.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The article is divided in five parts. The first    starts with an historical perspective of Itamaraty where we try to identify    the organization's long-term lines of action, both in relation to formal and    informal organizational patterns as well as in the interaction with entities    at distinct levels. It should be remembered, however, the main focus is on the    historical development from the 1990s and onwards, where there are structural    changes due to the globalization process. This takes us to the following parts    where the focus is on how Itamaraty has coped with the different dimensions    of globalization. The empirical data is taken from the leading units (Sub-secretaries)    in Itamaraty during year 2006. The focus of the second part is then on two Sub-secretaries    dealing with international "political" IOs, while the third analyzes the Sub-secretary    working towards "economic" IOs.

Historical Overview</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Itamaraty is not just a Ministry among others,    it is an institutional line of continuity from the very conception of the Brazilian    state, an organization that has come to embody the heart and soul of 'national    being', and expresses this as a watchdog of national foreign policy. Brazil    is indeed a rare country in the sense that its most relevant historical personality    is not a Chief of State, a military, or a national liberation hero: it is a    diplomat, known as the Bar&atilde;o do Rio Branco. Much of Itmaraty's uniqueness    stems from the 'heritage' of the Lusitanian era where one of the first landmarks    was the year of 1808, when the Portuguese Court was transferred from Lisbon    to Rio de Janeiro due to the occupation of Portugal by Napoleon's forces. The    maintenance of the Portuguese state machinery after Brazilian independence in    1822, transformed Itamaraty into a 'peculiar diplomacy' in the Latin American    context<a name="tx06"></a><a href="#nt06"><sup>6</sup></a>. One feature of this peculiarity was a remarkable continuity    among diplomatic representatives, which gave an exceptional stability to the    successive governments'<a name="tx07"></a><a href="#nt07"><sup>7</sup></a> orientation in terms of foreign policy.    Secondly, Brazilian diplomacy, throughout the nineteenth century, also benefited    from the constant 'osmosis' in human resources <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> the state's    economic institutions. Thirdly, the maintenance of a Monarchic system facilitated    the entrance into an 'international club', where Monarchy was the predominant    form of government. Luiz Alberto Moniz Bandeira captures the Brazilian administrative    'continuity', arguing that the change of regime in 1822 cannot really be seen    as the independence of a colony: "It was the Portuguese state established in    South America, the Brazilian Monarchy that was detached from Europe"<a name="tx08"></a><a href="#nt08"><sup>8</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">From an administrative point of view, an important    landmark came in the year 1834, when the first regulation of the Ministry was    approved<a name="tx09"></a><a href="#nt09"><sup>9</sup></a>. This implied a separation from the Ministry of War, which    represented a step towards the emancipation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,    starting it on the path towards becoming the leading actor in the planning and    execution of foreign policy. With the end of the Empire and the beginning of    the Republic in 1889, one the most profound influences on the identity of Brazilian    diplomacy was the Ministry of Jos&eacute; Maria Da Silva Paranhos Junior, more    known as the Bar&atilde;o do Rio Branco (1902-1912). During his period, foreign    policy was raised above representing one or another party or fraction and became    identified with the idea of unified nationality. Rio Branco even used the Palace    of Itamaraty as personal residence. It was during this time that the Ministry,    also called 'The House', became associated with the name 'Itamaraty'<a name="tx10"></a><a href="#nt10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A new kind of modernization took place in the    early nineteenth century, with the creation of the first unit dealing with issues    related to an international organization: the Brazilian/Pan-American Commission.    In the 1920s, the first permanent Brazilian delegation at an international organization    was created at the League of Nations<a name="tx11"></a><a href="#nt11"><sup>11</sup></a>. The reforms during the 1930s    and 1940s should be seen as part of a general process of rationalization and    modernization of the Brazilian state under Getulio Vargas's government (1937-1945    and 1951-1954)<a name="tx12"></a><a href="#nt12"><sup>12</sup></a>. One important step during this period was the creation    of the Rio Branco Institute (RBI), as a centre for research and education of    diplomats. Another was related to advances in the economic area, with, for example,    the creation of the Economic Commercial Division. Notwithstanding the changes    since the 1930s, Brazilian foreign policy organization was too out of date to    face the challenges of the restructuring of the international order following    the emergence of the United Nations. In 1947, a diplomat was assigned directly    under Itamaraty's General Secretary, to centralize and systematize all elements    concerning UN organizations and the Pan-American Union, and to give recommendations    in relation to a posterior reorganization of the Ministry. That same year, Itamaraty    created the Commission for International Organizations (COI) that was going    to be in charge of all issues related to Brazilian commitments with IOs<a name="tx13"></a><a href="#nt13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Organizational changes during the early 1960s    were strongly shaped by the paradigm of what was known as the 'Developmental    State', which meant to give a strong role to the state as a central agent of    development<a name="tx14"></a><a href="#nt14"><sup>14</sup></a>. Industrialization, planning and administrative reform    were central elements, together with a 'pragmatic' foreign policy guided by    the doctrine of 'Independent External Policy'. This initiated a rethinking of    the international system towards the perspective of a multipolar world in which    Brazil could "become part of a new center"<a name="tx15"></a><a href="#nt15"><sup>15</sup></a>. A deep process of discussion    around foreign policy organization, led to what has been called "the most elaborated    reform in the history of Itamaraty" in 1961<a name="tx16"></a><a href="#nt16"><sup>16</sup></a>. An outcome of such    reform was an increasing 'independence' of Itamaraty from the Executive, resulting    from the strengthening of the role of the Secretary General (always a career    diplomat). This official became an indispensable point of reference for the    Minister of Foreign Affairs since it was the Secretary General who directly    led all foreign policy operations. The triennium 1960-62 was a period of expansion    where Brazil undertook a particularly aggressive commercial and diplomatic stance    towards the region. One example of this was President Juscelino Kubitschek's    (1956-61) proposal of a 'Pan American Operation'<a name="tx17"></a><a href="#nt17"><sup>17</sup></a>. Regional integration    reached a historical step forward in 1961, with the creation of the Latin American    Free Trade Association (LAFTA). Kubitschek's government marked the transition    of Itamaraty into a modern diplomacy, where Economic Diplomacy, Regionalism    and Multilateralism laid deep roots in the organizational structure and culture<a name="tx18"></a><a href="#nt18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Beyond the 'atypical' period of the first Military    government of Castello Branco (1964-67), the subsequent military governments    continued with the Developmental line of action<a name="tx19"></a><a href="#nt19"><sup>19</sup></a>.    Foreign policy was again set along a national path where Development and Sovereignty    were mixed into a national ideology. Since the mid-1970s, with the deterioration    of the world economy and its tendency towards more protectionist and discriminatory    measures from the core countries, cooperation with periphery countries turned    into an imperative. That was particularly true in relation to a strategic integration    of Brazilian and Argentinean productive processes, conceived within the path    of broader integration to the international economy<I>.</I> Such line of action    was continued by the new Democratic government of President Jos&eacute; Sarney    (1985-90), which deepened the regionalist policy. Despite nationalist lines    of continuity, in the late 1980s the external level showed great shifts, along    the lines that we described in the introduction. This meant, for Brazil, to    push the GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs) negotiations towards    a new kind of commitment to the opening of markets, the end of the East-West    conflict, and the deepening of integration processes in North America and Europe.    All such elements set the Brazilian diplomacy in a new context. At Itamaraty,    from an administrative point of view, this situation was confronted with the    administrative reform approved in 1986<a name="tx20"></a><a href="#nt20"><sup>20</sup></a>.    Although the 1961 structure (see <a href="/img/revistas/rbpi/v51n1/a02qdr01.gif">chart 1</a>)    already had introduced a kind of three-tier structure with the creation of the    <I>Secretaria Geral Adjunta</I>, this structure was definitely consolidated    with the 1987 reform, where both Departments and Divisions were placed directly    under a Sub-secretary (<I>Subsecretaria-Geral</I>). There are also units named    Co-ordinations (<I>Coordena&ccedil;&otilde;es</I>), but these have the same    level and status as the Divisions. This restructuring will be analyzed further    in the next part.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>3. Dealing with International Political Organizations</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Much has transpired since the Ministry established    it's first unit to work directly towards an international organization in the    1920s. With the emergence of the United Nations, in 1945, Itamaraty started    a process of reform to deal with the new kind of multilateral IOs that pervaded    the international system. A more definitive administrative footprint in the    early 1960s (see <a href="/img/revistas/rbpi/v51n1/a02qdr01.gif">chart 1</a>), with the creation    of a Division dealing specifically with the Organization of American States    (OAS), a Secretary with a Division for UN issues, and another working with International    Conferences. But it would be misleading to argue that the attention on IOs was    only motivated by exogenous elements.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The institutionalization of Developmentalist    policies led to an acknowledgement that a country, which did not have military    or economic strength to enforce its position in the global arena, had to search    for other ways of exerting influence. This lead to an emphasis on diplomatic    activity at the UN, which was seen as one of the few areas where Brazil could    have leverage. However, at the same time it could be damaged if lacking a proper    line of action. Nonetheless, when confronting the challenges of globalization,    the Brazilian policy towards the international system before the 1990s was described    as "an archaic position of non-participation and non-submission to international    rules of coexistence elaborated by authoritarian rulers"<a name="tx21"></a><a href="#nt21"><sup>21</sup></a>.    With globalization, distances were reduced, interdependence was accentuated,    and "the world that Brazil treated as an externality had become internalized"<a name="tx22"></a><a href="#nt22"><sup>22</sup></a>.    One challenge, as a Brazilian pundit explained<a name="tx23"></a><a href="#nt23"><sup>23</sup></a>,    was the increase of the number of international organizations and an interdependence    of economic, social, and political policies. Another challenge was the unprecedented    pervasiveness of international rules or norms at the national level. As held    by Felipe Lampreia, when looking at the evolution of the organizational structure    since the early 1960s, there is no doubt that coping with globalization has    impelled the development of new tools and mechanisms in order to deal with international    organizations<a name="tx24"></a><a href="#nt24"><sup>24</sup></a>. In the organizational    structure of 2006, there are two key units dealing with these organizations:    the Political Sub-secretary I (<I>Subsecretar&iacute;a-Geral Politica </I>I,    SGAP I) and the Sub-secretary of Economic and Technological Issues (<I>Subsecretar&iacute;a-Geral    de Assuntos Econ&oacute;micos e Tecnol&oacute;gicos</I>, SGET). The first deals    with political IOs and the other handles economic IOs &#150; a division of labor    that has been maintained since 1961. Analysis of the SGET will be left to the    next part of the study. Instead, here the focus is on the SGAP I, which by 2006    had acquired a much more complicated structure than ever before. The 1961 structure    to deal with IOs was basically maintained in the late 1970s, but changed in    the late 1980s when transformed to a Sub-secretary, with three Departments and    eight Divisions. Those eleven units of the Sub-secretary, were increased to    fourteen (four Departments and ten Divisions) when the SGAP I was created on    January 2003. However, the change was not only about quantity of units, but    also in enhanced influence of certain issues in the international arena. One    good example was Environment, which in 1988 was in the Sub-secretary of Human    Rights and Environment, but was upgraded to a Department of Environment and    Special Issues in year 2006 (see <a href="/img/revistas/rbpi/v51n1/a02qdr02.gif">chart 2</a>).    This had in turn three Divisions, of which two dealt exclusively with environmental    issues. Undoubtedly, the new global requirements around environmental issues    had influenced the organizational evolution of Itamaraty.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Regarding Environment, it is surely not a coincidence    that changes started at the beginning of the 1990s, with the new 'global issues'    and the so-called 'Earth Summit' held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. For this study,    more interesting than the unofficial name is the formal one (United Nations    Conference on Environment and Development, UNCED), which was the result of intensive    diplomatic work carried out by Itamaraty (among other institutions). According    to Flecha de Lima, the idea of an environment conference was, at the beginning,    regarded with suspicion by the Brazilian diplomats<a name="tx25"></a><a href="#nt25"><sup>25</sup></a>. They were afraid    of a hidden agenda from core countries aiming to break Brazilian sovereignty    over the Amazonian region, but also wary of the involvement of a myriad of Non-governmental    Organizations (NGOs) and their influence in policy-making. It is clear that    something happened in the early 1990s, and particularly at this environmental    summit, where Brazilian diplomacy took a new line of action: Brazil initiated    here "a new phase in its international relations"<a name="tx26"></a><a href="#nt26"><sup>26</sup></a>. Fernando Henrique    Cardoso (1995-2003) explained how, for the first time, Itamaraty changed its    traditional position of isolating itself from international NGOs because of    their criticism of the country<a name="tx27"></a><a href="#nt27"><sup>27</sup></a>. Instead of seeing the worries of    the international community as a threat, these were increasingly considered    as an element of great value for solving problems, both nationally and abroad.    Thus, Brazilian diplomacy pressured to change the title and scope of the conference,    to include the concept of 'Development'. In this way, Itamaraty prevented the    conference from only dealing with environmental issues based on technical and    juridical grounds, recognizing that there is a tight relation between environmental    and social problems. But the change in way of doing things was not only related    to the IOs. It was also directed towards the national level, where there was    an opening up in contact towards NGOs and the private sector, as well as in    coordination among state entities. In the preparation for this summit, the Brazilian    government established an inter-ministerial commission with all involved units    of the Federal Government. The government also created a National Working Group    in order to centralize those activities concerning Brazil as the host country.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One can further observe the impact of the 'global    issues' in the new composition of the SGAP I, where the area of Human Rights    was elevated from a Division to a Department of Human Rights and Social Issues.    One of the issues that led scholars to speak about a 'defensive' and 'isolationistic'    position of Brazil in international forums, was related to the Human Rights    issue during the military regimes (1964-1986). With the end of authoritarian    rule, Brazil assumed a more assertive role in that field.<a name="tx28"></a><a href="#nt28"><sup>28</sup></a> This    was evidenced by participation in global UN forums such as. the World Conference    on Human Rights Conference held in Vienna in June 1993. It hosted representatives    of 171 states and had a massive presence from civil society. As in the area    of Environment, Brazilian Diplomacy had in started beforehand to apply its strategy    of active involvement in the different committees that anticipated the Conference.    Brazil was also chair of the Conferences' Redaction Committee, where the right    to Development was accepted as an inalienable part of the Universal Declaration    of Human Rights. It also included the eradication of extreme poverty and social    exclusion as a 'high priority' for the international community. At Itamaraty,    the new impact of the Human Rights issue led to the creation of the Department    of Human Rights and Special Issues in 1995, with two Divisions: one which concentrated    on Human Rights and related UN organizations, and the other worked with the    areas such as Health, Women and other issues that indirectly deal with Human    Rights. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Going further through the SGAP I, we can see    in <a href="/img/revistas/rbpi/v51n1/a02qdr02.gif">chart 2</a> that a unit of international organizations    (Department of International Organizations) remains but its activity was more    concentrated on issues relating to the UN's core entities, such as the General    Assembly and the Security Council. It is important to remember that the Brazilian    candidacy for a permanent seat at the Council has been one of the historical    goals of Brazilian diplomacy. Moreover, the SGAP 1 also participated in another    of the significant Brazilian commitments since the 1990s: the UN's Peacekeeping    Missions. Brazil has participated in approximately 24 peacekeeping missions.<a name="tx29"></a><a href="#nt29"><sup>29</sup></a>    But the deepest Brazilian involvement was related to the current UN's Stabilization    Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Also in this field, we can see a more aggressive    line of action. Although Brazil had been somewhat reluctant to participate in    'imposed' peacekeeping missions, that attitude changed when it was expected    that such participation would help Brazil towards its objective of obtaining    a permanent seat at the Security Council, and Brazilian leadership in Latin    America<a name="tx30"></a><a href="#nt30"><sup>30</sup></a>. It is interesting    to observe here that the multidimensional pattern that has become more frequent    since the 1990s. For example, Brazil's striving for Regionalization (e.g. a    common MERCOSUL line of action regarding MINUSTAH) and power bargaining at the    UN (Brazilian position at the Security Council) both evidence increased participation    in the international arena.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Looking further at the changes at the Department    of International Organizations, one can see that it contains a Division of Organization    of American States. It's noteworthy that a Division dealing with hemispheric    issues has been removed from the (geographic) area of American issues, to one    of international political organizations. Such a transfer could be seen as an    example of the increasing interconnectedness between hemispheric and global    organizations. Such interconnectedness is also becoming apparent as the UN is    becoming more an umbrella of organizations with different points of formal and    informal connection. What is perhaps more surprising is the inclusion of the    Department of Europe, and its two Divisions dealing with Western Europe (mainly    EU) and Eastern Europe (e.g. Russia and Ukraine), in the SGAP I. This was a    break with the traditional structure along bilateral lines, where each country    was set under a Department that grouped a region, and all these Departments    were within the same Sub-secretary. As you can see in <a href="/img/revistas/rbpi/v51n1/a02qdr02.gif">chart    2</a>, this kind of structure was maintained at another Sub-secretary, the SGAP    II.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the late 1980s, the Department of Europe (without    a unit above it), was placed under the Sub-secretary of Political and Bilateral    Issues, together with the other regionally structured Departments (including    the Department of the Americas).But things have since become more complex. In    2006, the Department of Europe, where the most important relation was with the    EU (as a region and with individual member countries), was placed in the area    of International Organizations. This might be in line with the argument of strengthening    of SOAs composed by IOs. Such arenas have a new kind of actors (as regional    constellations), where states increasingly act in coordination with each other.    From that perspective, it was probably much more difficult to handle bilateral    relations separately with what was happening in international organizations.    Core countries or regions (such as EU) have traditionally been leading actors    at IOs, so it is probably not a coincidence that the bilateral relations to    these countries are being mixed with IOs. Other indications of the increasing    importance of IOs could be the number of Brazilian diplomats working at them.    However, it is important to observe that this is not new. In fact, the figure    for IO representation is roughly the same as twenty years ago.<a name="tx31"></a><a href="#nt31"><sup>31</sup></a>    It seems as if most of the increase of staff working with these organizations    has been made within Brazil. The number of Brazilian diplomats working with    IOs is probably much larger than the amount of people working in units abroad.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>4. Dealing with Global Economic Organizations</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The unit dealing with international economic    issues has always had an important position. Brazil was (from very early on)    active at the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), a strong force behind    the creation of UN's Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In the 1970s,    Brazil shifted its attention from UNCTAD towards GATT, since that was the place    where general rules for industrial products where defined. It should be remembered    that already by the end of the 1970s more than fifty percent of Brazilian exports    were manufactured products<a name="tx32"></a><a href="#nt32"><sup>32</sup></a>. Still, by the early 1980s, Brazilian    bargaining power was reduced. It was problematic that decisions concerning international    economic policies became more complex, but the main issue was related to the    debt related problems of the 1980s. This contributed to what Marcelo de Paiva    Abreu described as a 'rather defensive' position, both at GATT and at the start    of the WTO negotiations<a name="tx33"></a><a href="#nt33"><sup>33</sup></a>. In 1995, the GATT was transformed to the    WTO, as the central institution governing the multilateral trading system and    trade-related global governance issues. While the GATT was established by twenty-three    states, its successor now has more than 148 members, which attests to its importance    as a global institution. With the WTO, a negotiation process restricted to certain    countries became unacceptable for the majority and new forms of negotiations    demanding increased transparency were implemented<a name="tx34"></a><a href="#nt34"><sup>34</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For Brazilian authorities, according to Celso    Amorim<a name="tx35"></a><a href="#nt35"><sup>35</sup></a>, the year 1995 marked the start of a phase of 'dissonances'.    One such dissonance stemmed from the overload of requirements from the WTO.<a name="tx36"></a><a href="#nt36"><sup>36</sup></a>    Its demands for transparency resulted in an intense amount of notifications    about governmental activity related to the trade area, which had not been requested    by the GATT. Besides this constant monitoring, the working of the WTO also demanded    a periodical reporting of member countries' foreign trade. Brazilian diplomacy    had to rapidly acknowledge the fact that the new kind of commercial negotiations    went far beyond simple exchange and tariff concessions, producing a broad range    of regulations with deep implications for the domestic field. To that, one has    to add the additional overloading and complexities of dealing simultaneously    with at the WTO, FTAA or EU-MERCOSUL negotiations. The Brazilian diplomacy,    influenced by Fernando Henrique Cardoso's worldview, became convinced that the    maintenance of national 'autonomy' demanded proactive participation in the WTO.    Yet, as Flecha de Lima pointed out, there was such a lack of expertise that    he, as General Secretary, had to go against the organizational culture, hiring    consultants from outside The House to handle the negotiations<a name="tx37"></a><a href="#nt37"><sup>37</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To cope with the new challenges, Itamaraty created    new thematic divisions were created to deal with the access to markets, intellectual    property or trade controversies at the WTO<a name="tx38"></a><a href="#nt38"><sup>38</sup></a>    (see <a href="#qdr03">chart 3</a>) and a group of twenty new diplomats were    sent to the Brazilian Mission to the European Communities and to the Brazilian    Delegation in Geneva for an intensive training regarding commercial negotiations.    Upon their return to Brazil, most of them were incorporated into the Economic    Department. Itamaraty did also stimulate a more frequent presence of scholars    and consultants of different areas, and placed more importance on coordination    entities including the followings: National coordination of issues related to    the FTAA (SENALCA); the National section for coordination on issues related    to EU/MERCOSUL negotiations (SENEUROPA); and the Inter-ministerial group for    international trade (GICI). These entities were seen as tools through which    the government could stay in touch with the opinions from the Brazilian civil    society. Compared with the organizational structure of the late 1980s, we can    see that the SGET in the 1990s longer has substantial parts of the SGET's Department    of Commercial Promotion. Although this area has not disappeared from Itamaraty,    much of it was moved over to the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign    Trade, created in 1999.</font></p>     <p><a name="qdr03"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rbpi/v51n1/a02qdr03.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another unit that is no longer part of the SGET    was the Economic Division for Latin America, which means that there has been    a division of labor where the economic Sub-secretary has become fundamentally    focused on international (global) organizations. That was part of a two-fold    process of concentration and diversification that has been accentuated since    the 1990s, at the SGET as in other units. The 'concentration' was a result of    the enormous demand stemming (principally) from WTO<a name="tx39"></a><a href="#nt39"><sup>39</sup></a>.    That impact pushed Itamaraty to realize that "it was impossible to attend the    universe of WTO-related issues without a further restructuring of the economic    unit". By the end of the 1990s, there was only one unit at the Department dealing    with WTO (the Division of Commercial Policy), which only had around four diplomats.    Most of the negotiation work was done at the Mission in Geneva. In 2001, that    Division was split into five units. What was a unit with little staff was turned    into a Department with around thirty diplomats. Hence, at the same time that    a Secretary was concentrated on WTO-work, there was an internal 'diversification'    to create new and more specialized units. By 2006, the Economic Department had    six Divisions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Today, the number of people involved in the current    commercial rounds of the WTO is much larger than ever before. It's also important    to note that the main growth in staff is at units in Brasilia, where there are    around thirty people working primarily with WTO issues. Adding to this the around    twenty staff at the Mission in Geneva, we are then speaking about approximately    fifty diplomats that, in one way or another, worked towards the WTO. Another    observation regarding the SGET is that while Brazil, in the past, prioritized    its activity at different Third World constellations such as UNCTAD, in the    1990s the 'offensive' line came to embrace organizations that had traditionally    been a domain of core countries, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation    and Development (OECD). In the 1990s, Brazil became a full member of the OECD's    Development Center: in the working group on corruption, in the Emerging Market    Economic Forums, and in the OECD's Agricultural Committee. The participation    here shows how Itamaraty tried to influence all levels possible, something that    not only required more diplomats, but also skillful people that could be used    to set the agenda in a new myriad of international working groups<a name="tx40"></a><a href="#nt40"><sup>40</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>5. Going Regional</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The signing of the founding Asuncion Treaty in    1991 led to the establishment, in 1994, of a political structure and a Common    External Tariff. Thus, by 1995 a long endeavor of dreams and aspirations for    Southern Cone integration (meaning fundamentally Brazil and Argentina) had reached    its highest historical peak through the establishment of an (incomplete) Customs    Union, the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUL). By the mid-1990s, the trade    and interaction between Brazil and Argentina reached a degree of interdependency    that made it increasingly difficult to turn back from the regionalization process<a name="tx41"></a><a href="#nt41"><sup>41</sup></a>.    MERCOSUL became an element of equilibrium through the realization of internal    efforts for economic growth and democratic consolidation, as well as an insertion    of its members as competitors in the global economy<a name="tx42"></a><a href="#nt42"><sup>42</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For Brazilian authorities, regionalization was    not detached from the overall globalization process. As Rubens Antonio Barbosa    explained, "Brazil sees regionalism as a kind of globalization in miniature,    which reproduces, in a limited space, certain characteristics of globalization    such as the multinationalization of productive processes, the intertwining of    economies and convergence of values and cultural patterns"<a name="tx43"></a><a href="#nt43"><sup>43</sup></a>. In    his opinion, the advantage with regionalization in relation to globalization    would be that it allows for more effective political control. Moreover, the    region was also the most dynamic market for export of Brazilian industrial products    and was seen as strategic for processes of economic adjustment and technological    modernization<a name="tx44"></a><a href="#nt44"><sup>44</sup></a>. The strategic importance of MERCOSUL was linked    to the fact that it was the tool through which Brazilian entrepreneurs first    felt the impact of commercial liberalization. In that sense, it had a kind of    pedagogic effect in anticipating the deepening of global liberalization processes,    without the risks of a deeper liberalization with, for example, massive Asian    imports<a name="tx45"></a><a href="#nt45"><sup>45</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A closer overview of the organizational chart    clearly shows the footprint of regionalization at Itamaraty. Comparing the different    organizational charts, we can see how the Divisions dealing with South America    (formerly within the Department of the Americas) have become a Sub-secretary    concentrated on South America (the SGAS), where even Central America is included.    One can also see how the unit dealing with South America was upgraded from Department    to Sub-secretary (see <a href="#qdr04">chart 4</a>). In 1988, on the other hand,    the units dealing with Latin American issues were at the same level (as Departments)    as those working towards other regions (Asia, Africa or Middle East). That situation    changed in January 2003, when the SGAS was created. As Eugenia Barthelmess<a name="tx46"></a><a href="#nt46"><sup>46</sup></a>    states, before January 2003 the activity rested in three separate areas: the    political/bilateral, the political/multilateral, and the economic/multilateral.    But the practical consequences of MERCOSUL implied that it was not longer possible    that one person (a General Sub-secretary) could command bilateral negotiations,    and another in charge of the economic negotiations of MERCOSUL or the Andeans    countries. As she pointed out, "one could not longer say, here does MERCOSUL    end, and here starts our bilateral relations with Argentina".</font></p>     <p><a name="qdr04"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rbpi/v51n1/a02qdr04.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The new character of this Sub-secretary was innovative    since, for the first time, a Sub-secretary combined the three dimensions mentioned    above: the political/bilateral, the political/multilateral, and the economic/multilateral.    According to Barthelmess, the reason for mixing political and economic areas    was that it was more practical that a single person, the Sub-secretary, could    have a complete vision. That is, to join the traditionally separated political,    economic, bilateral and multilateral perspectives in one single geographical    field. As far as she could see, the result was positive since it allowed the    Brazilian chief diplomat to see the whole picture, while his foreign counterparts    were generally committed to only one dimension and had to consult other colleagues    to understand what was happening. However, one has to be careful to attribute    all these changes to MERCOSUL. The political will from each government or influential    diplomats is also a reason for the creation of different units, which might    lose importance when other people are in command. Nonetheless, the increasing    demand in time and resources from MERCOSUL is a trend that is generally recognized.    Beyond whatever forms regionalization takes in the future (and there is much    discussion around the future of MERCOSUL), the trend at Itamaraty since the    1990s is of increasing attention towards the South American region. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us delve a bit further into what happened    at the SGAS. The traditional Divisions of Meridional America I (Uruguay, Argentina,    and Chile), Meridional America II (Andean countries) and an old reliquary, the    Division of Frontiers, still remained in year 2006. One novelty was the creation    of the Department of Integration, with two units: the Division of Regional Integration    and the Division of the Common Market of the South. Another new unit was the    Department of International Negotiations, with two Divisions. According to Barthelmess,    the main difference between these two Departments is that while the former was    concentrated more exclusively on MERCOSUL's internal issues, the latter worked    with MERCOSUL's negotiations (as a block), with extra-regional countries, or    regions. This unit contained, for example, a Division of Free Trade Areas of    the Americas, working with the FTAA, and a Division of European Union and Extra    Regional Commercial Negotiations, dealing with EU/MERCOSUL negotiations. It    is interesting to observe that, in this case, the word 'international' is applied    to all extra-regional negotiations, implying, in a way, that the 'regional'    dimension is becoming 'national'. Moreover, it was important to note again the    mixing of all these economic-oriented units at a Sub-secretary that also deals    with bilateral relations. The former domain of the Economic Division for Latin    American, that was part of the Economic Department, now belonged to the South    American Sub-secretary.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A further change was that the Division of Central    and Septentrional ('of the North') America was discontinued. In fact, there    appears to be some uncertainty in relation to how to deal with the North American    countries. It is a bit puzzling to see that the Department of North and Central    America, and the Caribbean (with a Division of Mexico, Central America and the    Caribbean) is at the South American Sub-secretary (SGAS), while there is a Division    of United States and Canada that lies directly under the Political Sub-secretary    I (SGAP I). The relations with the US appear to be handled more directly by    the Minister and not by a single unit (such as a Sub-secretary or a Department).    It makes sense that it belongs to SGAP I because it is placed together with    the EU and the Political IOs.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another hemispheric unit in the SGAP I is the    Division of the Organization of American States, that previously was part of    the same structure as the other 'Americas' units. Since the 1980s, the label    'Americas' has disappeared from Itamaraty's organizational structure. One cannot    avoid here to see the long-term lines of change, where the emergence of other    regional and global organizations has overshadowed the importance of hemispheric    IOs. Today, the unit dealing specifically with the Organization of American    States (OAS) is only a third-tier unit. Moreover, it almost looks like a political    statement when the Division in charge of the hemispheric economic area (FTAA/ALCA)    became directed from the South America Sub-secretary (SGAS). That is, it became    an organizational unit with regional scope. Political statement or not, it is    a good example of the porosity of levels that has been talked about. Things    are becoming a bit confusing when traditionally bilateral relations are conducted    from a 'regional' unit, or when the 'national' interaction with a 'hemispheric'    unit was conducted from a 'regional' one.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, nothing of what has been said should    be perceived as if hemispheric issues are no longer relevant. Even though Brazil    has given priority to its relations with Argentina/MERCOSUL and the South American    region, it never ceases to be active at all possible levels. In the 1990s, the    hemispheric level gained an unprecedented intensity and scope through the Summits    of the Americas. Although the Summits were frequently associated with the intention    to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), it also dealt with political    and social issues, and many of the initiatives along that line have been Brazilian.    After an initiative of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil, together    with Canada, assumed the coordination of some of the main themes of the Summit,    related to strengthening of democracy and human rights. The creation of the    Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG) at a hemispheric level, and the coordination    by Itamaraty of national groups for implementation the Summit's decisions, were    aimed to secure the necessary flow between the IO, national government and civil    society.<a name="tx47"></a><a href="#nt47"><sup>47</sup></a> All this required of course much more expertise and work    force: a common pattern with all areas presented here.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another interesting dimension that appeared in    the 1990s is the intra-regional dimension. None of the Latin American regional    organizations preceding MERCOSUL, in which Brazil was involved, reached the    same level of international actorhood. That changed the way in which foreign    relations were conducted, from 'bilateral' to increasingly 'multilateral' and    'intra-regional'. Looking at the latter form, besides MERCOSUL, Latin America    formed another important regional organization: the Andean Community (AC). In    1998, the AC signed a Framework Agreement for the creation of a Free Trade Area    between the Andean Community and the MERCOSUL, which could be seen as the first    intra-regional agreement in Latin America. Another relevant intra-regional relation    was with the EU and its prior form in the European Community (EC). The emergence    of MERCOSUL implied a new form of relation with the EC that was itself deepening    its integration by turning into the EU in 1992. From the Brazilian/MERCOSUL    perspective, the EU dialogue was of great significance since it gave international    legitimacy to the 'building block' efforts<a name="tx48"></a><a href="#nt48"><sup>48</sup></a>. Yet, gaining that legitimacy    involved a large amount of administrative work. It is actually impressive that    this expansion has been handled with a relatively small increase of staff. There    was a slow increasing of staff, with around 500 diplomats between 1946 and 2005.    But things are changing, through a recently approved (in 2006) staff enlargement    of 400 diplomats over four years, which indicates a huge re-dimensioning of    the organization. There are those who argue that this will be negative for the    maintenance of the level of professionalism and skills that Itamaraty is known    for. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To sum up, although the Brazilian governmental    initiative around a deepening of MERCOSUL might, at some points in time, look    stagnant or dubious, that is however not reflected in Itamaraty's internal structure.    In fact, by the late 1990s, Spanish became one of the three (formerly only English    and French) obligatory languages for Brazilian diplomats. The SGAS is, by far,    the geographical unit with most diplomats and it is larger in staff than SGET    or SGAP II<a name="tx49"></a><a href="#nt49"><sup>49</sup></a>. Not to mention the amount of diplomats at the regions'    embassies where those of the Southern Cone have improved their position<a name="tx50"></a><a href="#nt50"><sup>50</sup></a>.    It also interesting to see how so many strategic units, working with negotiations    towards a plethora of countries and regions across the world, have now as their    node the South American Sub-Secretary. It is actually from this unit that more    and more international negotiations are, and this certainly indicates something    about the importance that Itamaraty attributes to regionalism in its organizational    structure.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>6. Reaching Diasporas</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The creation of the Sub-secretary for Co-operation    and Brazilian Communities Abroad (SGEC) is another change that we associate    with globalization. Traditionally, all issues related to the contact with citizens    abroad were handled by the Juridical and Consular Department, which in the late    1980s was part of the Sub-secretary of Bilateral Issues. Even when the organization    was transformed to a three-tier structure, the issue remained at a secondary    level. Yet, today the more consular-oriented work related to Brazilian communities    abroad have gained a first ranking position as a Sub-secretary. Back in the    1960s, as Ant&otilde;nio F. Azeredo Silveira wrote, the "Ministry of Foreign    Affairs did not lend service to the public, at least not directly, excepting    some consular activities<a name="tx51"></a><a href="#nt51"><sup>51</sup></a>. It can be said that its only finished    product is foreign policy". That <I>modus operandi </I>appears to be changing.    At the turn of the century, one of the most important phenomena in Brazilian    international relations was that of the increasing flow of Brazilians abroad.    According to Sebasti&atilde;o do Rego Barros, when Brazilian activity during    the last ten years was discussed, few pay attention to the effect of Brazilians    abroad on the national diplomacy<a name="tx52"></a><a href="#nt52"><sup>52</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To grasp this reality, in the mid-1990s, Itamaraty    made a survey of the Brazilian Diaspora noting that there were around 1.5 million    Brazilians living abroad. The largest concentration of people was found in Paraguay,    USA and Japan. By 2004 it was estimated that more than 170,000 lived in the    US, and around 280,000 in Japan. As Barros further explained, there was an additional    three million people that traveled abroad each year, and approximately 4.5 million    Brazilians were potential users of consular services. It is also important to    point to family remittances that at that time were around US$ 4 billion, and    by 2003 went to above 5.2 billion<a name="tx53"></a><a href="#nt53"><sup>53</sup></a>. But Brazil was not alone, the    increasing attention to Diasporas was part of a trend where many governments    implemented a broad series of policies aimed at strengthening links between    migrants and their countries of origin, as well as promoting their economic    contributions through e.g. family remittances.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This area of Diaspora also has its own IO, the    International Organization for Migrations (IOM), which supports learning among    countries to deal with migrations. Brazil got closer to it in 2004 by becoming    full member, after participating as an observer country since 1955. Taking into    account the new migratory picture and its implications for national Development,    Brazil formulated a new consular policy oriented to a more effective protection    of citizens abroad. It was clearly defined that the assistance and protection    of Brazilians abroad was a priority of the country's foreign policy. Secondly,    it intended to change Itamaraty's administrative culture concerning citizens    abroad. As Barros held, in the past, the service was given in a bureaucratic    fashion, almost mechanically<a name="tx54"></a><a href="#nt54"><sup>54</sup></a>. A modern service, he said, demanded    new breed of officials with an increasingly professionalized service orientation,    in which courtesy and efficiency can assist its citizens abroad. Thirdly, it    was defined that there had to be a conceptual change regarding consular services.    These "had to go where citizens are", leaving aside the diplomacy's former position    of merely receiver of demands. A fourth element was linked to the diffusion    of consular services where Itamaraty had to be more active in informing people,    since citizenship also meant "to know your rights". As Felipe Lampreia advocated,    the consolidation for Brazilian communities abroad leads to a re-thinking in    that these Brazilians should be granted the possibility to take part in national    development, "wherever they are, and give them the option, freedom and opportunity,    to be Brazilians here or there"<a name="tx55"></a><a href="#nt55"><sup>55</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The strengthening of the activity of reaching    Diasporas can be observed in the organizational structure, where a unit dealing    with cooperation and Brazilian communities abroad gained a more relevant position    becoming a Sub-secretary. In 2006, it was the Sub-secretary with the most diplomats    and units (Divisions and Departments), and appears to be one of the most dynamic    areas of change within Itamaraty. In particular, this dynamism is seen in what    is referred to as the approximation of diplomatic and consular agendas<a name="tx56"></a><a href="#nt56"><sup>56</sup></a>.    This could be regarded as a process of linking Diasporas with National Development    goals, something that demands a new way of seeing nationality and space. In    this case, 'Going global' implies a state that is interested in active citizenship,    even of those far away from the home country. Perhaps it is too soon to speak    about Diasporas in relation to Brazilians, or even Latin Americans in general,    but it is indeed a theme that deserves more study<a name="tx57"></a><a href="#nt57"><sup>57</sup></a>. The term Diaspora    is used here as a way of pointing out the new role that Brazilian communities    are playing abroad. They are no longer a loose mass of emigrants, or people    in exile, but increasingly are becoming communities that are gaining a new kind    of organized links with their home countries. It is not surprising that this    issue emerged with globalization. Although it is true that globalization and    diasporization may be separate phenomena, "they go together extraordinarily    well"<a name="tx58"></a><a href="#nt58"><sup>58</sup></a>. Issues such as the 'deterritorialization' of social identities,    the intensity of international migrations, as well as technical tools promoting    an unprecedented speed of communications, are all part of this linkage. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is interesting to observe how areas such as    technical exchange, communities' abroad, culture, and trade promotion are now    under the SGEC (see <a href="/img/revistas/rbpi/v51n1/a02qdr05.gif">chart 5</a>). The new composition    of this secretary intends to also cut across different areas of work, which    had been traditionally separated. An example is the joining under the same structure    Divisions that traditionally dealt with consular activities with those from    the economic areas. Stemming from different areas, units such as the Juridical    and Consular Department, Department of Commercial Promotion, and the Department    of Culture, were linked together under a common scheme. This unit is undergoing    change, and it is not yet known what composition it will have in the future.    Sticking to our aim, what is important to note here is the tendency of mixing    traditionally separated areas in order to attend to new global themes. In this    case, the new role given to Brazilian communities abroad, which give arise to    a new way of defining citizenship and national development.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>7. Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The evidence drawn from this research points    to an increased influence on Itamaraty from a multiplicity of actors at different    regional and international levels: the UN system, International Governmental,    and Non-governmental Organizations. We can also see here the effects of the    'deterritorialization' of the national space and the conception of citizenship,    as well as of a more fluid porosity among levels and policy areas. It is however    important to remark that all these elements were, more or less, already part    of the process of change of Brazilian foreign policy organization during the    post war period. Yet, it is clear that since the 1990s, globalization has shacked    up the whole Itamaraty organization, demanding rapid changes in order to cope    with new kinds of demands. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A first element to highlight is the new way of    looking at the world where 'South America', a region, is now the common ground    of a Sub-secretary from which Itamaraty deals with 'national' issues. What formerly    were bilateral negotiations are now conducted through Itamaraty's 'regional'    (South American) Sub-secretary.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Secondly, the interaction with global IOs has    reached unprecedented levels and was separated in two different fields: economic    and political. Speaking about the 'economic', the emergence of WTO implied a    challenge that required a new kind of attention. Together with MERCOSUL, the    WTO was the entity that appeared to have had greatest impact on Itamaraty's    way of doing things. It was seen as pivotal both because its leverage in the    international field and for its direct impact on Brazilian Development. However,    it is important to note that WTO-related issues are still fundamentally handled    from a national perspective, which shows the limitation that Latin American    regionalism still has. In relation to the 'political', there is an expansion    of activities associated with 'global issues' such as Human Rights or Environment.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thirdly, we found an unprecedented positioning    regarding Brazilian communities abroad. The view of Diasporas as an asset for    national Development and linking them to other levels of activity (economic,    political) has meant a restructuring of diplomatic and consular activities.    It also led to an acknowledgment of the need to create a change of mentality    to meet the needs of a global policy. These demands set off different levels    of understanding, distinct modalities of discourse, and an endless amount of    forms of acting<a name="tx59"></a><a href="#nt59"><sup>59</sup></a>. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lastly, there is a new kind of crosscutting among    areas, both in relation to formerly separated issues, as well as in the intertwining    of bilateral and multilateral relations. The South American Sub-secretary is,    perhaps the clearest example of this, something that shows the influence of    the 'new regionalism' in the organizational structure. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This study shows that the changes since the 1990s    created new kinds of difficulties and challenges, but these problems were also    regarded as possibilities. Instead of criticizing the decision-making (or opinion    creating) arenas from outside, Itamaraty sought to restructure its organization    in order to influence as much as possible from inside. It is outside the cope    of this study to assess to what extent Brazil has in fact increased its influence    globally. But it is possible to state that Itamaraty's organizational structure    has continued its process of change since the 1950s, with the aim to influence    as much as possible, wherever possible. However, regarding the patterns of change    produced by globalization, in the near future, Brazilian diplomats will probably    have to live up to their own organizational slogan: "the best tradition at Itamaraty    is to now how to change itself"<a name="tx60"></a><a href="#nt60"><sup>60</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Recebido em 9 de novembro de 2007    <br>   Aprovado em 15 de mar&ccedil;o de 2008</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <a name="nt01"></a><a href="#tx01">1</a> Putnam,    Robert D.

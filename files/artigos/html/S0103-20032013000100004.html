Foram    entrevistados 450 consumidores em supermercados e feiras ecol&oacute;gicas em    Porto Alegre, Brasil. Os resultados indicam um grande n&iacute;vel de penetra&ccedil;&atilde;o    e uma atitude muito positiva em rela&ccedil;&atilde;o aos produtos org&acirc;nicos.    Os entrevistados acreditam que os alimentos org&acirc;nicos s&atilde;o mais    saud&aacute;veis, saborosos, mais naturais e ambientalmente corretos, apesar    de serem menos atraentes visualmente e mais caros que alimentos convencionais.    Os respondentes das feiras ecol&oacute;gicas representam um segmento espec&iacute;fico    com valores mais orientados para quest&otilde;es sociais. Os resultados mostram    um alinhamento entre atitude positiva e comportamento do consumidor na amostra    estudada. O estudo contribui para todas as partes envolvidas na cadeia de produtos    org&acirc;nicos, j&aacute; que o conhecimento dos atributos mais valorizados    pelos consumidores pode apoiar o varejo a coordenarem a cadeia de suprimentos,    estimulando mais produtores na ades&atilde;o &agrave; certifica&ccedil;&atilde;o    org&acirc;nica, melhorando suas pr&aacute;ticas produtivas e renda. Consumidores    tamb&eacute;m se beneficiam da oferta de alimentos org&acirc;nicos.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palavras-chaves:</b>    Alimentos org&acirc;nicos, comportamento do consumidor, survey.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The aim of this    study was to investigate consumers' decision-making process, attitudes and values    towards organic food throughout the employment of the Theory of Planned Behaviour,    adapting the methodology from a European project. 450 consumers were interviewed    at supermarkets and farmers' markets in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Results indicate    a high penetration level and very positive attitude towards organic products.    Organics are believed to be healthier, tastier, more natural and environmental    friendly, although being less attractive and more expensive than conventional    food. Respondents from the farmers' market represent a specific segment whose    values are more oriented toward society. The findings showed an alignment between    positive attitude and consumption behaviour among the surveyed consumers. The    study finally contributes to the stakeholders in general, since the knowledge    of the attributes more valued by consumers can help retailers to play the role    of coordinators of this supply chain, stimulating producers to adhere to organic    certification, helping them to upgrade their production practices and improve    their income. Consumers are also benefiting from this offer in the market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Key-words:</b>    Organic food, consumer behaviour, survey.    <br>   <b>Classifica&ccedil;&atilde;o JEL:</b> M390.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>1. Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is widely recognized    that patterns of food consumption have experienced rapid change over the past    few years/decades as result of concerns on environmental sustainability, development,    nutritional aspects and also health issues. Along with this trend, organic agriculture    has been expanding quickly around the world. Statistical information on organic    agriculture is now available in 141 countries. The area of agricultural land    used for organic agriculture has increased by almost 1.9 million hectares from    2006 to 2007. Latin America has shown an increase of 1.4 million hectares of    its area devoted to organic agriculture over this period, which represents a    growth rate of 28%. In Europe, in turn, the increase was about 0.33 million    hectares (4%) (WILLER and KLICHER, 2009). One of the consequences this trend    has shown during the past decades is the increasing demand for academic research    on consumers' preferences and organic food (SHEPHERD, MAGNUSSON and SJ&Ouml;D&Eacute;N,    2005).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organic food is    defined as the product, both fresh and processed, obtained or made according    to the standards of organic agriculture. According the International Federation    of Organic Agriculture Movements - Ifoam (2009), organic agriculture is a production    system that sustains the health of soils, people and ecosystems, using organic    pesticides and avoiding, for instance, the use of antibiotics and growth hormones.    It relies on tradition, innovation and science, looking up to benefits for people    and for the environment, promoting the quality of life of all stakeholders involved    in this chain. The organic producer must respect established norms in all production    stages, from the seeding process until packaging, always concerning about the    process' impact on the natural environment.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumer behaviour    is considered an essential subject in several fields of study such as marketing,    management, psychology and economy. There are many intrinsic mechanisms within    behavioural processes; the study of these topics has thus become frequent and    essential to understand consumer behaviour. A study conducted in 2002 by the    Brazilian Environmental Ministry (BRASIL, 2008) identified that 73% of the Brazilian    consumers show interest in purchasing organic products for consumption and that    81% seem to be motivated to buy it when the label informs that it was produced    following the organic product's regulations and it is environmental friendly.    More than half of the Brazilian organic production is exported and it is expanding.    In 2001, the production of certified organic agriculture occupied 275.576 hectares    and in 2007, 880.000 hectares. In 2008 this area reached the mark of 1.765.793    hectares (WILLER and KLICHER, 2009), twice as much as 2007.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Motivated by this    expressive growth of the organic market, several studies concerning consumer    behaviour towards organic food have been conducted in many countries (BAKER    et al., 2004; KRYSTALLIS and CHRYSSOCHOIDIS, 2005; HONKANEN et al., 2006; KRYSTALLIS,    FOTOPOULOS and ZOTOS, 2006; HUGHNER et al., 2007; WILLER and KLICHER, 2009),    including Brazil (GUIVANT, 2003; DAROLT, 2004; VILAS BOAS, SETTE and BRITO,    2006; LOMBARDI et al., 2007; SOARES et al., 2008). Such studies contain a focus    of analysis whose emphasis is given to the values, motivations and beliefs of    this consumer. Most of them have investigated how consumers perceive organic    products and what are consumers' attitudes towards them. In general, the studies    conducted in Europe revealed that purchase intention of organic foods were linked    to health and environmental consciousness as well as safety and quality issues    such as taste, flavour, freshness and price.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, beyond    usual concerns with health and food security, consumers are also worried about    social issues and environment protection. These consumers normally have a more    positive attitude in relation to the organic products. Nevertheless, there is    still room for further investigations regarding consumer behaviour of organic    products in developing countries. The growing importance of the organic food    chain and the ongoing changes in consumers' lifestyle are constantly motivating    studies of such nature. A more psychological approach, focusing on attitudes,    beliefs and lifestyle may reveal a consumer of organic products different from    the usual. In that sense, the constructs proposed by the Theory of Planned Behaviour    (TPB) can help emphasize these aspects. The TPB is one of the most applied models    in the literature (e.g., DE CANNI&Egrave;RE, DE PELSMACKER e GEUENS, 2009),    especially when the goal is to explain human behaviour in the food area (AERTSENS    et al., 2009; KRYSTALLIS et al., 2009; DEAN, RAATS and SHEPHERD, 2008; DREEZENS    et al., 2005; TH&Oslash;GERSEN, 2000). The performing of a meta-analysis by    Armitage and Conner (2001) corroborates the efficiency of the TPB model to predict    intentions and consumer behaviour towards organic products.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of this    study was to explore consumer behaviour towards organic food in Porto Alegre,    capital of Rio Grande do Sul (the southernmost state in Brazil) aiming to understand    its decision-making process, attitudes and values. The emphasis here is given    to the TPB constructs (behavioural beliefs, norms and control) and how much    they influence purchase intention and consumer behaviour towards organic products.    First, we wanted to investigate consumption patterns of organic food (adoption    and frequency) within two distinct marketing channels (supermarket and farmers'    market). Consumers' attitudes and beliefs, including the attributes that influence    the purchase and consumption of organic products were also investigated. Finally,    consumers' values were assessed, as they play an important role in understanding    consumer behaviour. The methodology used in the study was adapted from an EU    funded project - the Condor Project and further information is presented at    the methodology section.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper is organized    as follows. Section 2 reviews consumer behaviour theories considering an international    context and previous research on organic food; this section presents the Theory    of Planned Behaviour (TPB) from Ajzen (1985), which is the most applied theoretical    framework in consumer behaviour studies worldwide, as well as an overview about    the basic human values, presenting the Schwartz Value Theory. Section 3 presents    the methodology applied in this study and section 4 summarizes the main findings.    Finally, section 5 draws the conclusions and suggests a research agenda for    future studies.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>2. Theoretical    Background</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>2.1. Consumer    behaviour towards organic food</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumer behaviour    is considered as one of the most complex and enigmatic areas inside marketing.    Attempts to understand this issue have led to the increase on the number of    studies related to the subject. Consumer behaviour is regarded as one of the    most important topics in these days as it can be seen at the Marketing Science    Institute priority research list for 2009.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although concerns    with environmental protection and human health figured among consumer concerns    in the US since the sixties (KLONSKY and TOURTE, 1998), the topic only became    popular in the EU during the eighties (GREENAN et al., 1997). These concerns    have only arrived to Brazil later on, during the nineties (GUIVANT, 2003; DAROLT,    2004). Several studies make clear that one of the central issues of the 21th    century is the challenge of environmental sustainability (CZINKOTA and RONKAINEN,    1995 apud KRYSTALLIS and CHRISSOHOIDIS, 2005). Organic food can be said to be    the representation of environmental sustainability on the debates concerning    food production. In addition, it integrates consumers' health and food safety    concerns.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumer behaviour    is directly linked to consumer's culture, family, environment as well as to    their economic reality. According to Solomon (2002), people buy a product for    its meaning and not for what it is capable of doing. A product, such as food,    represents more to the consumer than its physiological function. Consumers point    as decisive factors for the consumption of organic products their family heath,    environmental concern, safety and better taste of food (DAROLT, 2004; LOMBARDI    et al., 2007). Attributes such as brand, image, certification, traceability    and price are not among the most mentioned on the studies. It does not mean    that those attributes are not important. In fact, it shows new trends to be    explored by researchers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>2.2. Trust,    beliefs and motivations towards organic food consumption</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Grunert (2002)    says that the perception of food quality occurs after the purchase, preparation    and consumption. Consumers, to take their decisions at the time of purchase,    should form a concept known as expected quality. Quality, however, is usually    composed by two elements: intrinsic and extrinsic quality. Intrinsic quality    can be described as those attributes that are not directly perceived by the    consumer, which are coupled to instruments such as labels and certifications.    The absence of additives, chemical residues and food value, for example, are    called intrinsic characteristics of food. Extrinsic quality, in turn, is described    as those attributes easily perceived by the consumer, i.e., visible, such as    colour, appearance, size, shape and price. These characteristics may not be    sufficient for consumers to choose to purchase the product because it does not    guarantee its safety or quality. Formal mechanisms such as governmental agencies    or some public or informal monitoring, such as brand reputation, can contribute    to consumer assessment.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Food quality is    a relevant attribute in buying organic food. It is the relationship between    expected quality and perceived quality that determine consumer satisfaction    (OLIVER, 1993). The label guarantees that the consumer is buying an organic    product. Especially in the case of certified organic food, the information asymmetry    can be harmful, because the consumer is not able to identify the absence of    chemical components in food - basic requirement in organic farming.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Market failures    are the basis of the formation of the Transaction Costs Economics (TCE), which    accepts that information is imperfect or asymmetrical. Herbert Simon (1957)    broke-up the economists' belief of full rationality with the following two assumptions:    the existence of opportunism and bounded rationality. These two factors occur    when one or more parties know the underlying circumstances relevant to the transaction,    although this information cannot be costlessly discussed by or displayed to    others (WILLIAMSON, 1985). TCE sees man as a rational actor but the risk of    opportunism is always present, especially under a condition of information asymmetry.    The lack of information results on uncertainty which can be stated as an imperfect    knowledge about an event. The uncertainty surrounding a transaction can assume    different levels. On one hand, for the buyer, it can be an uncertainty of quality,    a reliable supply, timeliness or quantity. On the other hand, it can be the    seller searching for a buyer. And for both agents, price can be uncertain (VIEIRA,    2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this study,    information asymmetry occurs when one or more agents has particular information's    about credence, safety or product' value. Asymmetry creates an adverse selection    problem in the market as informed investors' trade on the basis of their private    information, such as quality (BROWN and HILLEGEIST, 2007). It is essential to    ensure this quality. The relationship between the quality and uncertainty must    be minimized (AKERLOF, 1970). Organic certification is a way of emphasizing,    to guarantee the quality of the process production, establishing a relationship    of trust between the producer and consumer of organic food, avoiding the informational    asymmetry. Trusting in the certification process is very important to consumers,    also due to the rapid growth of organic supply chain.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consumer trust    in products that are offered on the market is generally expressed through their    concerns with the label. This assumes the certification process by which the    product goes through, and also by who defines and controls this process and    the use of standards. The importance of the label is highlighted by the product's    regular consumers, expressing the fact that when a label is displayed on a product,    the latter can be of higher quality and consumers will feel safer (GRUNERT,    2002; LOMBARDI et al., 2007; ESSOUSSI and ZAHAF, 2008). These details about    the level of trust show that the consumer is aware of who is deciding whether    a product can be considered organic and if the standard procedure of certification    is being properly implemented.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Grunert (2002)    states, the highest level of trust is linked to less satisfaction with available    information and more demand with regard to additional information. When a consumer    believes that information can be trusted, the information becomes much more    useful and will be in higher demand (MAUTE and FORRESTER Jr., 1991). According    to Vieira and Traill (2008), the relationship between consumers and producers    is extremely important to build trust on the product. Trust in the company certification,    in turn, is requisite to the organic market to exist. It is not enough for consumers    to believe in the benefits of organic food, they need to be ensure that the    food being bought and consumed is really coming from organic agriculture. The    gap between monitoring and certified producers contributes to undermine the    development of the organic market because it allows the action of opportunism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/04f01.jpg">Figure    1</a> shows, search attributes are those that consumers can evaluate before    purchasing. Experience attributes are those for which consumers can evaluate    only when consuming the product. Credence attributes are those for which the    consumption does not bring information on the quality (for example the use of    pesticides). Because customers cannot detect credence attributes, extrinsic    cues must be used to indicate the presence of these attributes. As extrinsic    cues have nothing to do with the physical product, experience cannot be used    to judge if the product contains the necessary attributes. In this case there    is a need for reputation or labelling that the customer can trust.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organic food can    be classified as credence attribute, whereas its key attributes cannot be evaluated    by consumers even after purchase and consumption. Associated with this fact    is trust. Organic food consumer need to believe in the product label. Belief    is a subjective trial between two or more objects. It is based on the knowledge    about attributes and characteristics of a product in expectation terms (AJZEN,    2008). What a consumer knows or has learned about a product determine their    beliefs about it. The beliefs in relation to a product determine how favourable    the attitude will be (FISHBEIN and AJZEN, 1975).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are several    beliefs associated with organic food. Among them we can mention better flavour,    higher quality, better for health, more expensive, environment-friendly and    more attractive (GRANKVIST and BIEL, 2001). As Steenkamp (1990) mentions, descriptive    beliefs are those beliefs that result from direct observation (and via any of    the five senses) of the product characteristics. By trying on the product before    buying or tasting it, for example, consumers can form descriptive beliefs about    the brand and its type of quality attributes based on experience and not on    a belief. However, sometimes consumers do not have the opportunity to taste    the food before buying. Furthermore, enjoying the experience does not add any    information about credence attributes, which results in lack of information    for the consumer, regarding to the experience's attributes. Food beauty or quality    is not based just on visual perception, but also on producer's reputation and    on the certification company. The are several studies which confirm many of    these quality claims for organic food (ALF&Ouml;LDI et al., 2006; NIGGLI et    al., 2008), but there are also studies that shows there is no strong evidence    that organic and conventional food differ in concentrations of various nutrients    (DANGOUR et al., 2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Academic research    has shown that the major motivations for buying organic products are: (a) the    product is healthy, is good for health, (b) is more nutritious, (c) quality    and taste of food are considered higher when compared with conventional products,    (d) consumer is concerned about environmental issues such as soil contamination    with no pesticides, and (e) social issues - development of small farmers (FOTOPOULOS    et al., 2003; KRYSTALLIS, FOTOPOULOS and ZOTOS, 2006; LOMBARDI et al., 2007;    DEAN, RAATS and SHEPHERD, 2008). Shepherd; Magnusson and Sj&ouml;d&eacute;n    (2005) have demonstrated that benefits to health are more related to attitudes    and behaviour in relation to organic food than environmental issues. As Th&oslash;gersen    (2000) argues, consumer will only care about an ecological, such as organic    certification if his/her values are related to environmental sustainability.    When he/she realizes that those certified products are really contributing to    the cause, he/she will buy them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In general, consumers    attribute positive qualities and characteristics when they are asked about organic    food quality and safety aspects. These positive attributions, such as tasty,    safe and fresh, are often interlaced with expectations of the organic production    process, which includes environmental concerns. Interestingly, a positive perception    is generally found among consumers, even though it is not always confirmed by    their respective purchasing and eating behaviour (NIGGLI et al., 2008). This    is one of the problems in the organic food context, the gap between attitudes    and behaviour: consumers are positive about organic food, but usually do not    buy it. This discrepancy is apparently explained by the fact that most consumers    do not consider the question "organically produced" as a determinant criterion    for purchase, and organic food is not seen as a substitute for conventional    food as regards to taste and shelf-life, two attributes of a great importance    (SHEPHERD, MAGNUSSON and SJ&Ouml;D&Eacute;N, 2005). Recent studies also indicate    that individuals, as citizens, present a weak link between their "speech" and    their actual food choices (KRYSTALLIS et al., 2009). It means consumers do not    always act the way they think or say.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>2.3. Theory    of Planned Behaviour (TPB)</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The connection    between attitudes and behaviour has been discussed continuously in the social    and behavioural sciences over the past fifty years or so (BUSCHT, 1998). Attitudes    do predict behaviour towards their objects and two major research programs succeeded    to clarify attitude-behaviour relationships. Rosenberg and Hovland (1960) were    the first researchers to propose the Tripartite Model, where attitudes are considered    affective, cognitive and behavioural responses toward an object. The model is    a trichotomy of feeling, knowing and acting. Affect represents the emotional    response, gut reaction, of how an object makes a person feel. The Cognition    means the beliefs, assumed knowledge, perceptions and thoughts, and Behaviour    signal the overt actions, intentions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This model was    the basic inspiration for the later Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), that suggests    that a person's behaviour is determined by his/her intention to perform the    behaviour and that this intention is, in turn, a function of his/her attitude    toward the behaviour and his/her subjective norm. In order to gain deeper understanding    of the factors influencing behaviour, it is required to look for the determinants    of the attitudinal and normative components. Those determinants are beliefs    that individuals hold about themselves and their environment, in other words,    information individuals have about themselves and the world in which they live.    Therefore, beliefs are viewed as underlying a person's attitudes and subjective    norms, and they ultimately determine intentions and behaviour (AJZEN and FISHBEIN,    1980).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Theory of Planned    Behaviour is the most widely known extension of the TRA, and was proposed by    Ajzen in 1985. The author inserted an additional construct, Perceived Behavioural    Control (PBC) to the model in order to account for situations where an individual    has less than complete control over the behaviour. The TPB is normally taken    to predict and explain consumer behaviour about food choice (TH&Oslash;GERSEN,    2000; DREEZENS et al., 2005; DEAN, RAATS and SHEPHERD, 2008). It is expected    that the relative importance of attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural    control varies in the prediction of intention, according to the different behaviours    and situations (AJZEN, 1985).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the    Theory of Planned Behaviour, human behaviour is grounded in three constructs:    (1) behavioural beliefs, (2) normative beliefs, and (3) control beliefs. Behavioural    beliefs are those attitudes towards the behaviour. Normative beliefs are the    subjective norms or perceived social pressure. Control beliefs refer to the    perceived behavioural control or self-efficacy. The power exercised by attitudes,    subjective norms and perceived control will therefore, determine behaviour intent    (AJZEN, 2001). The behavioural beliefs lead to a favourable or non-positive    behavioural attitude, the normative beliefs result in perceived social pressure    or subjective norms. Finally, beliefs about control induce the perceived control    over behaviour. This means that behaviour intention will be stronger as much    as perceived control is higher and when the attitudes and subjective norms are    favorable too.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The TPB is one    of the most applied models in the literature (e.g., DE CANNI&Egrave;RE, DE PELSMACKER    and GEUENS, 2009), especially when the goal is to explain human behaviour in    the food area (TH&Oslash;GERSEN, 2000; DREEZENS et al., 2005; DEAN et al., 2008;    AERSTENS et al., 2009; DE BARCELLOS, PEDROZO and VAN DER LANS, 2009). The performing    of a meta-analysis by Armitage and Conner (2001) corroborates the efficiency    of the TPB model to predict intentions and consumer behaviour towards organic    products. In general lines, consumers can be said to attribute positive qualities    and characteristics when they are asked about organic food quality and safety    aspects. These positive references, such as tasty, safe and fresh, are often    interlaced with expectations of the organic production process, which includes    environmental concerns. Interestingly, a positive perception is generally found    among consumers, even though it is not always confirmed by their respective    purchasing and eating behaviour (NIGGLI et al., 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The gap between    attitudes and behaviour is seen as one of the main challenges in the organic    food market: consumers are positive about organic food, but usually do not buy    it.

This means consumers do not always act the way they    think or say they do (KRYSTALLIS, BARCELLOS, K&Uuml;GLER, VERBEKE and GRUNERT,    2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although there    are several studies exploring consumer behaviour towards organic products in    Brazil (such as VILAS BOAS et al., 2008) few of them investigated psychographic    characteristics, in which the emphasis is given to values, motivations and beliefs    of this kind of consumer. A review of the literature in the aforementioned databases    and keywords did not identify any study on consumer behaviour related to organic    products in the TPB perspective applied to the Brazilian context. A more psychological    approach, focusing on attitudes, beliefs and lifestyle may reveal a consumer    of organic products different from the usual and the constructs proposed by    the TPB can help emphasize these aspects (ARMITAGE and CONNER, 2001). Hence,    the attitude-behaviour approach used in this study is based on the TPB and <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/04f01.jpg">Figure    1</a> presents the proposed model.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>2.4. Basic human    values: The Schwartz Value Theory</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consensus regarding    the most useful way to conceptualize basic human values has emerged gradually    since the 1950's (for a review see SCHWARTZ, 2005, 2007). Overall, values are    considered beliefs and they refer to the desirable and abstract goals people    strive to attain. The abstract nature of values distinguishes them from concepts    like norms and attitudes, which usually refer to specific actions, objects,    or situations (SCHWARTZ, 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Theory of Human    Values of Schwartz is based on the studies of one of the most prominent researchers    in the Social Psychology area (ROKEACH, 1973). The Schwartz' Value Theory defines    values as desirable, trans-situational goals, varying in importance, serving    as principle's guide in people's lives. It means that values serve as standards    or criteria to individuals since they guide the selection or evaluation of actions,    policies, people, and events. In addition, values can be ordered by importance    relative to one another. They form an ordered system of value priorities that    characterize people as individuals. This hierarchical feature of values also    distinguishes them from norms and attitudes (SCHWARTZ, 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the    theory, there are ten motivational types, which would include all the core values    recognized in cultures around the world. The ten motivational values are derived    from three human beings' universal needs, which are inherent to each individual.    These consist on (1) biological needs; (2) social interaction coordination requisites,    and (3) survival and welfare groups' needs.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ten motivational    values are subsequently divided into four dimensions. They can be described    by their central motivational goal, which is the crucial content aspect distinguishing    them. The Self-Transcendence dimension emphasizes equality, social justice and    helpfulness and represents the Universalism and Benevolence values. Opposite    to this dimension is Self-Enhancement, which is related to success, ambition,    authority and wealth (Achievement and Power values). Conservation, in turn,    emphasizes the devoutness and humility, the obedience and the social order,    favouring the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> (Tradition, Conformity and    Security values). Finally, Openness to Change dimension is related to an exciting    way of life, just as creativity and freedom, corresponding to Stimulation, Self-direction    as well as the pleasure given to the Hedonism value. Therefore, these four higher    order value types form two bipolar conceptual dimensions. This type of order    is derived from the location of values depending on their (negative) correlation    within the circle - hence values situated on one side of the circle will be    strongly negatively correlated with values on the opposing side of the circle,    yet positively correlated with values located nearby. In practical terms, this    means that a person who assigns high scores to values which are located in the    "security" value type is also likely to regard values located in the "conformity"    value type as "guiding principles of his life" - and s/he will be unlikely to    assign high scores to values located in the "stimulation" or "self-direction"    value types. <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/04f02.jpg">Figure 2</a> indicates    the theoretical model of relations among ten motivational types of values and    the respective four dimensions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>3.

The project combines the development    of segmentation approaches for consumers according to their values, based on    Schwartz Value Theory, as well as the emotional associations and moral issues,    based in the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) from Ajzen (1985). The Condor    Project gives information about the role represented by the values, affective    and moral issues in consumer decision-making on organic food, providing new    marketing insights to this kind of product.

The second is to model consumer choice of organic foods across eight    EU member states, measuring attitudes, values, affective responses and moral    concerns (TH&Oslash;GERSEN, 2006).

Data Collection</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the motivations    for this study is the growing interest of local and international retail chains    in understanding organic consumer behaviour issues in the Brazilian reality.    Hence, an international retail chain with widespread presence in Brazil (a total    of 400 shops located in 18 out of 26 States) provided operational support for    data collection in their supermarket stores. Organic food sales in retail chains    represent 45% of the Brazilian organic market. At the same time, the organic    farmers' markets are also relevant in this context, representing 26% of the    total sales (WILLER and KILCHER, 2009). Hence, data were also collected in two    organic markets, as they represent a traditional marketing channel for organic    products in Brazil and tend to attract more "environmentally conscious" customers    (DAROLT, 2001). This was something we tested looking for different results according    to the channel studied.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The initial stage    of this research was exploratory and included the theoretical and organic agriculture    review as well as the adjustment of the Condor questionnaire to the Brazilian    context. The questionnaire contained items which intended to measure attitudes    and beliefs towards organic food, consumption frequency and consumer's values.    To complete the survey, socio-demographic questions were additionally asked.    The questionnaire focused on the purchase of fresh organic tomatoes, one of    the products investigated at Condor project and widely recognize as a pesticide    susceptible product. The master questionnaire were developed in English and    translated into the national languages by using the procedure of back-translation.    Researchers carefully tested the questionnaire through personal interviews with    15-20 respondents in each of the countries in order to identify and eliminate    potential problems and to ensure linguistic equivalence.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A total of 450    respondents (187 at supermarkets; 263 at farmers' market) answered the questionnaires    throughout personal interviews, which were conducted by a professional market    research company over ten days. Six days were spent interviewing respondents    in seven different stores of a supermarket chain and four days were used to    collect data in two distinct organic farmers' market in Porto Alegre, capital    of Rio Grande do Sul State. This city was elected to this research because there    is located the pioneer farmers' market in Brazil. Porto Alegre was also the    first city in Brazil to create an Environment Secretariat. Because awareness    about sustainability is high amongst the population of Porto Alegre, it is considered    a good city to survey consumers in regard to organic food, as participants'    feedback can provide important managerial information to the other supply chain    members.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Respondents were    interviewed during their usual purchase ritual. They received in hands the scale    from each questionnaire section to help them choosing their answer. A filter    question was used in the data collection, asking the individuals the following    question "do you know what organic food is?" In the case of "yes" answers, the    participants were asked to present a brief definition. As participants were    trained to judge correct and incorrect answers, they could discard the cases    of incorrect responses and interview only those customers providing a correct    definition of organic food. Screening away those who did not know the concept    was actually an effective means to focus in on the segment of consumers that    is in the market for organic food. Hence, these results probably provide a more    accurate picture of the actual market situation for organic food in a big-city    in Brazil than a representative sample of the whole population would have done.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>3.3. Variables</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>3.3.1. Frequency    of consumption</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organic food market    penetration was measured by means of the question: "From the following alternatives,    please choose the one that best describes your shopping habits as regards organic    food". The alternatives were: (1) I have never bought, nor considered buying    organic food; (2) I have not yet bought, but I have considered buying organic    food, (3) I have already bought organic food, but I will not buy anymore; (4)    I buy organic foods few times a year, (5) I buy organic foods one or a couple    of times a month, (6) I buy organic foods weekly, and (7) I buy organic food    more than once a week. Non-consumers of organic food (i.e., those who selected    alternatives 1 and 2) represented 3.56% of the sample (17 respondents) and were    excluded from the analysis.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>3.3.2. Beliefs</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nine behavioural    beliefs, called by Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) <i>modal salient beliefs</i>, are    based on the attributes of search, experience and belief of foods, show how    much the consumer believes or not in the benefits of organic agriculture. In    this dimension, all items have the same initial format, such as "How likely    is that organic tomatoes...". The first item is regarded to the absence of pesticides    in organic food. The second referred to expensiveness. The third, if organic    tomatoes taste better than conventional ones, was followed by belief in the    environment-friendly production way. Freshness time and attraction level were    both measured. Beliefs such as "healthier" and "natural" were also asked. At    least, the fact of not been really organic was also brought up. All responses    were made on a 7-point scale, ranging from "extremely unlikely" to "extremely    likely".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>3.3.3. Attitudes    towards buying organic food</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Attitudes were    divided into five constructs, all measured by a 7-point Likert Scale. The first    one, <i>buying intentions</i>, was measured by two items, with response categories    ranging from "extremely unlike" to "extremely likely". <i>Attitudes towards    buying fresh organic tomatoes</i> were measured by means of seven items, reflecting    affective, cognitive and moral evaluations. One item was excluded from this    construct for statistical reasons (non-normal distribution), <i>Perceived social    norms</i> to buy organic food products was measured by two items, one reflecting    descriptive and the other injunctive norms, presenting response categories ranging    from "I should not buy" to "I should buy" and "strongly disagree" to "strongly    agree". The construct <i>Perceived barriers for buying organic food products</i>    was composed by four items, with response categories ranging from "difficult"    to "easy", as well as "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". Finally, the    <i>Subjective knowledge</i> or <i>Perceived uncertainty</i> construct was measured    by a five-item scale developed by Flynn and Goldsmith 1999 apud Th&oslash;gersen    (2006). The response categories ranged from "strongly disagree" to "strongly    agree".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>3.3.4. Values</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, for measuring    values' dimension, a complete version of Schwartz's Portrait Value Questionnaire    (PQV) was used (SCHWARTZ, 2005). The PVQ includes short verbal portraits of    40 imaginary persons. Each portrait describes person's goals, wishes or aspirations    that point implicitly to the importance of a value. For each portrait, respondents    are asked: "How much like you is this person?". A six-point graded scale of    answers was used, ranging from "not like me at all" to "very much like me".</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>4. Results and    discussion</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>4.1. Socio-demographic    profile of the sample</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The population    sample interviewed consisted of individuals of at least 18 years old which were    in charge of or sharing the responsibility of the household's grocery shopping    in the two analysed distribution channels. The data collected was analysed using    the software SPSS 16. <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/04t01.jpg">Table 1</a>    presents the socio-demographic profile of this sample.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The profile reflects    the prevalence of women in the sample in both supermarket chain and farmers'    market cases (79.1% and 69%, respectively). It also reflects the medium educational    level of the respondents, since more than 45% have completed the secondary school.    Most of the households have five or more individuals (family households) and    the ages vary between 31 and 65 years old in the case of the supermarket chain    respondents. The farmers' market case, in turn, presents a narrower age range    (older group), between 46 and 65 years old. Approximately 34% of the respondents    do not have children or the children do not live with them. In the supermarket    chain case, most of the children are between 6 and 12 years old. Within the    farmers' market the age range varies between 19 and 24 years old, consistent    with an older sample, as indicated above. The monthly household income is quite    similar in both cases, with most of respondents presenting monthly household    incomes from 1212 to 2019. Regarding household status, in Brazil, young people    most lived at home with either both or at least one of their parents and do    not purchase food products. It is also important to mention the low cost of    unskilled labour which allows that professionals such as maids are quite common    in the high income households and among their duties is purchasing and cooking    food for the family. This may explain the low education respondents found in    both channels.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>4.2. Respondents'    purchase frequency of organic products</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/04f03.jpg">Figure    3</a> shows the purchase frequency of organic food in both analyzed distribution    channels (penetration level).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Results indicated    that most respondents in the supermarket chain and farmers' market buys organic    food regularly, "every week" (51.3% and 59.3% respectively), followed by 30%    and 19.3% of respondents that buys it "few times a month". This indicates a    high penetration level within respondents' household.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>4.3. Dimensions    of beliefs</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="#f4">Figure    4</a> presents the results obtained with the nine behavioural beliefs investigated.</font></p>     <p><a name="f4"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/04f04.jpg"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The highest mean    value (6.82 for supermarket and 6.73 for farmers' market) was found in the item    "Healthier" indicating that respondents believe that organic foods are indeed    better for consumers' health if compared to conventional products. The lowest    mean was obtained in the item which asked how likely was that tomatoes sold    as "organic" were not really organic. Respondents considered this option highly    "unlikely" (3.82 for both) indicating a belief in the organic certification    process. Such results end up confirming that organic products rely on credence    attributes, at least in the Brazilian market. Respondents believe that organic    products are healthier, tastier, more natural and better for the environment,    although being less attractive and more expensive than conventional ones, something    that corresponds to the Brazilian market reality.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, as shown    in <a href="#f4">Figure 4</a>, beliefs related to consumption of organic products    seem to be very similar for respondents in both distribution channels. Therefore,    variance analysis (ANOVA, <i>p</i>-value=0.05) was carried out to investigate    possible significant mean differences. Significant differences between the distribution    channels were found in only three items: "Pesticides-free" (6.54 for supermarket    and 6.32 for farmers'), "Less attractive" (4.79 for farmers' market and 3.94    for supermarket) and "More natural" (6.74 for supermarket and 6.58 for farmers'    market), indicating that respondents from the supermarket chain believe organic    products are a bit more attractive, more natural and pesticide free if compared    to the means attributed by respondents in the farmers' market. Respondents from    the farmers' market seem to be a bit more sceptical, perhaps due to their slightly    higher level of "subjective knowledge" about organic food. Respondents from    the supermarket tend to have a more stereotypical, romantic view of natural    products.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>4.4.

The fact that the "Perceived social norms" is a two-item    scale probably induced the observed lack of consistency. In the latter, the    reverse item (Buying OT would require an extra effort) reduced the scale reliability    as its correlation with the other items was found too small. If deleted, reliability    would increase to satisfactory levels (Cronbach's alpha 0,565 and 0.690 for    supermarket and farmers' market, respectively).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Results presented    at <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/04t02.jpg">Table 2</a> show a positive    intention towards organic food purchase and consumption (range: 6.02 to 6.11),    consistent with the high penetration level presented in the aforementioned <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/04f03.jpg">Figure    3</a>. Consumers seem to socially accept organic food and demonstrate to have    a perceived control about organic food purchasing. High means values (range:    6.30 to 6.74) also demonstrated a positive attitude towards buying organic tomatoes,    with no statistical significant differences between channels. With regard to    barriers for buying organic food, respondents perceived more availability at    supermarket, probably due to products seasonality, which are more evident at    farmers' market. Uncertainty is more noticeable among supermarket respondents.    At farmers' market, respondents seem to have more refined subjective knowledge    about organic food, but they don't title themselves as "experts" (3.31) on this    theme. Only one item of the "Perceived uncertainty" construct didn't present    significant difference (<i>p</i>-value&lt;0.05). This item possibly has been    misunderstood by the respondents.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>4.5. Dimensions    of values</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The average for    each value is showed at <a href="#f5">Figure 5</a>.</font></p>     <p><a name="f5"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/04f05.jpg"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of    the data shows that, among Schwartz's ten motivational types, "Self-direction"    (0.2415) was the dominant value guiding respondents' purchase of organic food    in the supermarket chain, whereas in the farmers' market, the dominant value    was "Benevolence" (0.3748). The lowest index was found in the "Power" type for    both distribution channels. Statistical significant differences (<i>p</i>-value&lt;0.05)    between groups were found in four motivational value types: Benevolence; Universalism;    and Self-direction obtained higher means in the farmers' market group, confirming    that these respondents represent a different consumers' segment, more oriented    towards societal issues. On the other hand, the value "Achievement" obtained    a higher mean for the supermarket chain group.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interestingly,    results confirm that respondents from the farmers' market represent a specific    segment not only in regard to their buying characteristics (frequent, "heavy    users" of organic products) but also in relation to their behavioural profile.    Consumers showed very positive attitudes towards organic products and values    oriented to society, signalling a more collective way of life.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>5. Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The preceding literature    review sheds light on several key issues and elucidates our current state of    knowledge pertaining to consumer behaviour towards organic food, pointing to    gaps in the understanding of this field of study.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The literature    points out that there is a gap between attitudes and behaviour, meaning that    consumers are positive about organic food, but usually do not buy it. The findings    of this study showed an alignment between positive attitude and consumption    behaviour among the surveyed consumers. It also shows an overlapping of individual    values over collective ones, following results by a previous study carried out    in Brazil (VILAS BOAS; SETTE; BRITO, 2006). Individual attitudes towards buying    organic food are primarily based on beliefs about benefits (healthy, at first    place, as well as environment friendly and natural), while beliefs about visual    or risks are much less influential (such as less attractive and not been really    organic). It also suggests that values regarding benevolence are associated    to collective beliefs while those related to self-direction and hedonism refers    to individual beliefs. In this study, consumers purchasing in farmers' market    are older and more interest on collective issues than consumers shopping on    supermarkets, where individual values were more present. Although this difference    according to the distribution channel was seen, Brazilian consumers interviewed    show consistency on their beliefs and values towards a positive attitude and    knowledge on organic food.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study findings    also provide significant contribution to the stakeholders involved on the production    of organic products, being those small or medium family landholdings, retailers    or the food processing industry itself. For example, the knowledge of attributes    more valued by consumers can help retailers to play the role of coordinators    of this supply chain stimulating producers to adhere to organic certification,    helping them to upgrade their production practices and improve their income.    Public policies can be implemented to foster the production of organic products,    aiming to satisfy the demand and availability of the products in the market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those interested    in sustainability issues and focused on the development of the organic food    market can use the results to support managerial strategies to deal with the    growing demand for organic food. Urban Brazilian centers shows openness and    willingness to buy these products (WILLER and KILCHER, 2009). At the retail    level, an initial phase in the distribution of organic food was driven by small    food specialty shops and health food stores. However, large food retail chains    (multinationals such as Carrefour or Walmart, selling mainly conventional products)    entered the market and are gaining market share as part of their positioning    strategy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In terms of theoretical    implications, the hypotheses were tested and results shows that the replication    of the CONDOR's TBP Theoretical Model in the Brazilian context presents good    fit indexes, partially validating the model. The proposed model is adequate    to explain consumer behaviour towards organic tomatoes in Porto Alegre. Only    the constructs perceived uncertainty and subjective norm does not have a significant    influence on buying intention, as well as the construct availability in regard    to behaviour. The results clearly shows that subjective norms are not well accepted    in the Brazilian context, showing that third people's opinions are not decisive    in organic products' buying intentions. Personal evaluation, based on subjective    knowledge about this matter is therefore more decisive, suggesting that marketing    strategies should be oriented towards the final consumer. Frequency of purchase    (behaviour) is weakly determined by buying intentions, demonstrating the existing    gap between consumers' discourse (attitudes) towards organic products and their    actual behaviour (frequency of purchase) - i.e., people's behaviour is not always    consistent with their attitudes. Consumers often experience internal tensions    when balancing their own desires with moral behaviour that favours societal    well-being and evidence is clear that consumers' ethical concerns and attitudes    are not always manifest in actual behaviour (e.g. CARRIGAN and ATALLA, 2001).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While comparing    these preliminary findings with the Condor project, it is important to distinguish    household lifestyle and income in Brazil. The family size is generally larger    in number of people, young adults live with their parents and food shopping    may be in charge of a maid. Besides these differences, the results found were    not as different from the EU as expected. This issue should be clarified and    deserves in-depth research. On the other hand, as in European context, the unawareness    and unavailability of organic food is considered main reasons for not buying    organic. This finding represents an opportunity for supermarkets chains to improve    their supply chain management in order to reduce the uncertainty of consumers    finding the organic product on their shelves. This supply guarantee would possibly    attract to the supermarkets those consumers more collective-oriented that buy    on farmers' market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An additional objective    of the present study was to compare some of the results obtained within the    Condor Project in the context of Porto Alegre, providing a comparison between    organic consumption trends in developed and developing countries. One of the    most import conclusions from the Condor Project in Europe is that consumer choices    of organic foods seem to be grounded in similar reasons in all analysed countries.    Individual attitudes towards buying organic food are based on benefits beliefs    (e.g., healthier, tastes better, eco-friendly). Beliefs about risks and costs    are less influential. The results show, however, that decisions about buying    organic food are not only based on individual attitudes: social reasons seem    to be more relevant. The project results also came up against the unawareness    and unavailability of organic food; both have been considered reasons to give    up before even trying consuming them (TH&Oslash;GERSEN, 2006). Similar results    were found in Porto Alegre.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, organic    certification is still a new issue in Brazil but those consumers who buy these    products have already developed knowledge and trust on a credence attribute.    This suggests that a more transparent process with more information provided    to end consumer would increase the organic market in Brazil.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>6. Limitations    and future avenues for research</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important    to state that this study focused on the consumer behaviour towards organic food    products, with analyses based on a non-probability sample of respondents in    Porto Alegre, Brazil. Hence, our findings apply specifically within the demographic    characteristics of the sample, and descriptive generalizations to the broader    public must be treated with caution. In the future, multivariate statistical    analysis (such as factor and cluster analysis) could be applied, aiming to uncover    distinct market segments within organic consumers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, further    research on organic consumption should include other emerging countries, such    as China, India, among others. The understanding of organic consumer behaviour    in these countries comparing to more developed such as EU and US consumers would    show if there is a trend on the way this market evolves.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If consumers hold    several ethical concerns/pro-social attitudes but fail to behave accordingly,    then the existing theories of ethical consumer decision-making must evolve to    explain this discrepancy (CHATZIDAKIS, HIBBERT and SMITH, 2007). In that sense,    an important theoretical contribution of this work is the application of the    Theory of Planned Behaviour in organic food research in the Brazilian context,    showing theory applicability. Yet, future studies should consider the addition    of other explanatory variables on the ethical consumer decision-making context,    such as ethical obligation and self-identity (see for instance DE MAGISTRIS    and GRACIA, 2008).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>7.

Abstract In this article, we address the historical role of Catholic Church, as well as that of other religions, in the field of religious education in Brazil. Then, we discuss the meaning of the Evangelical rise in the intertwining of State policy, moral entrepreneurship, and sexual panics, in disputes involving sexual politics in school education. We draw attention to the complexity of these issues while facing the current challenge of producing a pluralist approach to sexuality in education.

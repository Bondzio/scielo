AbstractAdvances in water management require knowledge of the availability and demand of water resources to define priority actions for water conservation. The aim of this study is to support the development of municipal initiatives involving Water Footprint, based on a case study of Caraguatatuba, using 2012 data. The following water footprints were considered: a) the urban water system; b) sewage production; c) cattle-farming; and d) rural water uses. Results showed water footprint levels of approximately 400 MmÂ³/ year, where grey water represents the largest share (85 %). Furthermore, results showed that the increased pressure on local water resources results from the disparity between the sewage system in relation to the demands of a growing population. This study can contribute to improve Water Footprint methodology, promoting comparative studies and supporting water management policies in this socio-political field.

In this article, we bring to the fore some changes of women corporal practices that we have identified through the analysis of models of domesticity we found on issues of the popular magazine Casa & Jardim, printed from the end of the 1960s to the mid 1970s. We want to emphasize the appropriation of Pop language in the decoration of Brazilian domestic interiors as one of the facets of youth culture, which diffused internationally during the 1960s. Aligned with feminist ideas, revolutions of behaviors, and iconoclast attitudes of the youth of the time, Pop spaces have embodied new forms of mediation among people and artifacts and also have contributed to the transformation of corporal schemata, indeed associated with the representations of femininity.

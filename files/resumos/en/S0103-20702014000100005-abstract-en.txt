One of the principal controversies today in the field of labour and gender studies is the way in which the interdependence of the social relations of race, sex and class is conceptualized, with some authors appealing to "intersectionality" and others to "consubstantiality". The controversy is presented through a "situated" perspective that upturns the definition of science as objective and rational. The concept of consubstantiality is then applied to the analysis of gender relations, race relations and class relations in the care work, as well as the physical, technical and emotional work, in which these relations appear imbricated.

The international circulation of symbolic goods via the mass media has generated numerous debates on ways to interpret and analyze communication processes in the contemporary cultural frames. In this paper we refer to the formation of an evangelical radio chain based in Miami, made by radio affiliates that broadcast the signal in different cities of Latin America. The characteristics of this network allows us to investigate the problems of globalization, transnationalization and cultural location in the field of religion and the media. We analyze the spatial articulations, cultural mediations and interrelations between churches, mass media and evangelical audiences configured in the context of international evangelical cultural production.

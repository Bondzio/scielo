This article refers to the inter-generational changes that have occurred in educational terms and by social category in three of the main communes of the Arauc√°ria region of Chile. It analyses the rates of educational mobility and the incidence of parent's education (educational capital) in the educational level of the children. It also provides evidence of the social and inter-generational transformation by ethnic origin that has occurred in this region, as well as of the greater occupational opportunities opened for individuals who have risen to higher levels of education. The study shows that even when educational inequality resulting from ethnic origin remained, higher education has created opportunities for social mobility for most those who had access to it.

ABSTRACT The fandango de chilenas [fandango with spurs] is one of the three types of fandangos that we classify as &#8220;caipira&#8221; fandangos and which were ignored by most leading Brazilian folklorists. As a consequence, no relevant social or musical research on these manifestations has been done, other than the work of Rossini Tavares de Lima (1954) on fandangos de chilenas. We will show here the main cause of this bibliographical gap, as well as a brief description of fandango de chilenas and the transformations that have occurred over time, since it was last mentioned pertinently in the 1950s.

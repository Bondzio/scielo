Abstract The interview with Gisèle Sapiro about Pierre Bourdieu belongs to a group of texts that mark the 10th anniversary of the Pierre Bourdieu's death in 2012. Current director of the Centre de Sociologie Européenne (CSE), associated with the Centre Européen de Sociologie et de Science Politique de la Sorbonne (CESSP), Sapiro offers a broad overview of the international, particularly Anglo-American, reception of Pierre Bourdieu's work. Sapiro studied Comparative Literature in Israel and describes her encounter in Paris with Bourdieu who would become her professor and sponsor and whose work she would propagate. Based upon her experience as translator, Sapiro analyzes the reception of Bourdieu's work, showing how specific cultural features of different societies created a favorable context to certain aspects of Bourdieu's work and made the extraordinary success of Bourdieu's ideas among readers within different disciplines.

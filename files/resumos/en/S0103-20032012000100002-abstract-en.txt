We use alternative specifications of the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) to estimate the aggregate demand in Brazil for beef, pork, chicken, other consumption goods, and their elasticities. We detect the need for using time trend variables in models' equations so that we found an upward trend for the demand of each type of meat and a downward trend for other consumption goods. The dummy variable for the prices stabilization macroeconomic Real Plan indicated it has not changed demands. According to Marshallian own-price elasticities, meat demands are inelastic and demand for other consumption goods is elastic. Cross-price Marshallian and Hicksian elasticities confirm beef, pork and chicken are substitutes. Expenditure elasticities show that all goods are normal, except for pork, which is an inferior good. As personal consumption expenditure is likely to increase over time, ceteris paribus, meat consumption will lose importance to other consumption goods, beef consumption will lose importance to chicken and pork consumption will lose importance to the other two types of meat.

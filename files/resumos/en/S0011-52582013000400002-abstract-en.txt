This article explores three types of relation between space and politics in the modern political theory: one separates both categories, the other identifies them partially and the last one links them closely. The latter shows the connexions between structures, practices and spatial discourses that allow seeing how political facts are always "located", making it impossible to interpret them on the margins of their context of appearance and development. We defend, finally, the development of situated politics.

AbstractThis article reflects upon how the authors, from social research to learning embroidery in Cartago, Valle del Cauca. We argue that this approach has two co-constitutive dimensions: the learning of this craft in domestic and everyday spaces by, mainly, women embroiderers, and learning to embroider as central aspect to the process of researching the everyday space that inhabit women embroiderers. We understand this learning encounter as a knowledge dialogue that involves contact with craft embroidery in, both, its material and human dimension. We present how such encounters, between our experiences and interests as social researchers and the experience of master embroiderers, generate learning spaces, experimentation and creation that escape the market logic that characterizes the learning of embroidery at present in this region.

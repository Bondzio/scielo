Abstract The article presents the history and main features of an interdisciplinary undergraduate course - Practices of Academic Reading and Writing - developed in 2014. It has been offered and expanded by FFLCH-USP since 2015, with a growing number of professors, assistants and students. The course requires an ongoing process of evaluation, reflection and successive transformations. This text provides an as is assessment, because we believe the collective experience from six semesters allows us to point to the innovative aspects of our project regarding two central elements of the process of formal learning: the privileged forms of interaction between professor and students and the ways students organize knowledge.

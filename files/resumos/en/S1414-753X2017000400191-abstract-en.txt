Abstract Socioeconomic impacts of the construction of the Ferreira Gomes Hydroelectric Power Plant (UHEFG) were analyzed in communities of fishermen affected before and after the filling of the reservoir. The study occurred between 2014 and 2015, in the municipality of Ferreira Gomes-AP. Data were collected using forms (Nsample=48) and a comparative analysis was performed to evaluate their significance (Mann-Whitney, p&lt;0.05). The results showed that the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) did not adequately predict impacts in the fisheries sector. The comparative tests confirmed a) six variables with significant variation (p&lt;0.05): monthly income, number of trips to fish, fishing difficulties, environmental conditions of the Araguari River, socioeconomic and environmental impacts; and b) a variable at the limit of significance (p&#8776;0,056): fish trade. We concluded that the reparatory measures did not reestablish the socioenvironmental conditions, generating conflicts not foreseen.

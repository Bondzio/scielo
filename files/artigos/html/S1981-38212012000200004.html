For some authors, the main    explanation involves the proactive and reactive powers of the chief executive.    Other scholars argue that negotiations with deputies for portfolios and pork    are the most important factors behind success in approving legislation. This    paper proposes an innovative methodological strategy to test the mechanisms    behind each of these theories. Original survey data of 12 Brazilian state-level    assemblies is examined to assess elites' attitudes in regard to governors' strategies    to obtain legislative support. Results suggest that there is not a unique equilibrium    to the problem of coalition formation in multiparty settings. Deputies with    concentrated constituencies, from more decentralized parties, and from conservative    parties, tend to believe that the most efficient way a governor can obtain legislative    support is to negotiate amendments with deputies. On the other hand, the more    scattered a legislator's constituency and the more liberal or centralized his    or her party, the more likely a deputy is to think that governors achieve better    legislative success when they negotiate cabinet positions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Key words:</b> Executive-Legislative relationship;    subnational politics; survey data; legislators' attitudes.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The legislative success of governments in Latin    America more broadly, and in Brazil in particular, has been explained by two    main theories. For some authors, the main explanation involves the proactive    and reactive powers of the chief executive, which gives him a central role in    formulating and conducting the government's agenda (Aleman and Tsebelis 2002;    Figueiredo and Limongi 1999; Morgenstern 2004; Santos 2003;). Other scholars    believe, however, that negotiations with deputies for portfolios and pork -    along with the need to form coalitions and cabinets - are the most important    factors (Altman 2000; Ames 2001; Amorim Neto 2006a; Amorim Neto and Santos 2003;    Inacio 2006; Nunes, 2011; Pereira and Mueller 2004; Raile et al. 2010; Zucco    Jr. 2009). Although these approaches have contributed to the understanding of    political reality in many places, I propose here an innovative methodological    strategy to test the mechanisms behind each of these theories.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Instead of observing how legislators vote when    the government presents its agenda, I evaluate the conditions under which legislative    support may be obtained based on elites' attitudes in regard to governors' strategies    to obtain legislative support. The paper, therefore, does not intend to explain    the degree of legislative success of presidents or governors, but presents empirical    evidence showing that success varies considerably because legislators' attitudes    to the executive also vary. In accordance with Power and Zucco Jr. (2011), I    also believe that the views of parliamentarians give us an unique interpretation    of the behavioral data we have access to. In their own words, "although revealed    preferences are often more reliable than stated preference, the views of parliamentarians    can tell us about the interpretation of the behavioral data. After all, self-perceptions    of legislators and their evaluations of the national political reality enable    a rich contextualization of the behaviors observed in the floor." (Power and    Zucco 2011, 10)</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I believe successful negotiations occur when    the governor can offer legislators and political parties the resources they    care most about. It is not accurate to assume that there is only one strategy    that would appeal to all legislators. As deputies have different electoral backgrounds    and are members of different party organizations, one could suppose that such    features would determine the preferences of each actor, and therefore, his behavior.    A successful chief executive should realize that different legislators need    different resources. What I propose in this paper is a research design to evaluate    which legislators' features would produce an easier (or harder) setting for    executives intending to approve their agendas based on legislators' attitudes.    Such an idea cannot be assessed by behavioral data, but can be approximated    by surveys with legislative elites. To accomplish this, I have collected data    from a survey rolled in twelve Brazilian subnational states between 2007 and    2008.<a name="tx1" href="#nt1"><sup>1</sup></a> Therefore, I was able to identify    the stated preferences of legislators - as expressed in their opinions - which    should suggest how Brazilian governors would get the biggest "bang for their    buck" when they offer partners the resources that maximize their expected votes.<a name="tx2" href="#nt2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given that politicians care greatly about electoral    success, and that they only have their time in office to convince voters to    support them, I argue that the degree to which a legislator is convinced to    support the governor's agenda depends on the governor's ability to give him    or her a "great deal" - meaning that the offer matches up and satisfies that    legislator's demand. That is, the success of a government will depend on the    capacity of a governor to (1) find information on the desires and needs of his    or her potential allies, (2) distribute and/or share political power and resources    according to this information, and (3) dictate how resources will be offered    to his or her allies. In the investigation, I identify patterns that could explain    why certain coalitions happen to be successful, while others fail.<a name="tx3" href="#nt3"><sup>3</sup></a>    This is not to say that attitude data is superior to behavioral data, but simply    that the complementation of each other produces a wider perspective.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first task in this empirical project is to    check whether there is, in fact, variation among legislators' perceptions of    the utility of different political resources controlled by the governor. More    specifically, I investigate whether legislators prefer to receive one kind of    resource instead of another from the chief executive. After that, my focus shifts    to identifying which features of legislators and political parties influence    deputies' opinions about their relationship with the Executive. I use a Multinomial    Logit Model to estimate the effect of (1) the type of the deputy's constituency,    (2) the degree of the deputy's party centralization, and (3) the ideological    position of the party of which the deputy is a member has on that deputy's opinion    of "the best strategy that a governor can pursue to obtain legislative support."    I find that there is no unique solution to the problem of coalition formation    in multiparty settings. In fact, the chief executive must find an ideal strategy    for different kinds of players, and this is what makes the strategic game between    them so interesting to study.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In sum, my results show that members with concentrated    constituencies, from more decentralized parties, and from conservative parties,    tend to believe that the most efficient way a governor can obtain legislative    support is to negotiate amendments with deputies. On the other hand, the more    scattered a legislator's constituency and the more liberal or centralized his    or her party, the more likely a deputy is to think that governors achieve better    legislative success when they negotiate cabinet positions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Institutions, Resources, and Governability</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Brazilian institutional arrangement often    requires the Executive to build governing coalitions.<a name="tx4" href="#nt4"><sup>4</sup></a>    However, forming a coalition is not a sufficient condition for governments to    rule. First of all, in the sample space of all possible types of coalition formation    in multiparty systems, some arrangements simply will not work. Moreover, minority    governments can also succeed in getting their agendas approved (Laver and Schofield    1990; Saiegh 2004). Nevertheless, if most governments in Brazil since 1988 have    taken the form of party cabinet (Amorim Neto 2006b), it is reasonable to assume    that presidents share their resources expecting that allies participating in    the cabinet will, in turn, support his or her agenda in the legislature. This    general idea has been called "presidencialismo de coaliz&atilde;o" (Limongi    2006). Although there is a high degree of explanatory power behind this reasoning,    no analyses of the Brazilian case have considered the constraints involving    the exchange of political resources for legislative support.<a name="tx5" href="#nt5"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is an important point, as the use of strategies    to mobilize political or budgetary resources strongly depends on the relationship    between the government's agenda and the preferences of the actors in play. As    Cheibub et al. (2004) have shown, a chief executive will only have incentives    to share power if the preferences of the actors needed to achieve a majority    and approve the agenda do not match those of the executive. The authors call    the attention to the negotiation over the content of policies voted in the legislature.    If the parties agree on a certain topic, then the president may not need to    negotiate patronage or pork with deputies/parties in exchange for support of    that policy. The ideological position and the preferences of the political party    will determine the likelihood of a deputy to support the policy in question.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Assuming that the political distance between    political parties is given, the work of Amorim Neto (2006b) builds on our knowledge    of the connection between presidential success and the operational conditions    under which it is achieved. The author discusses the main incentives motivating    an actor (individual or collective) in a coalition cabinet. According to Amorim    Neto, the distribution of offices in the cabinet will depend on the volume of    the resources mobilized by the president, the power of the Legislative against    the Executive, and the individual legislator's ability to pursue an Executive    position without losing his or her opportunity to win future legislative elections.    Amorim Neto's expectations vary depending on features inherent to the negotiation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">First, to have an efficient bargain, the governors'    offer to actor <i>X </i>must correspond with the expectations raised by <i>X</i>.    For instance, one cannot convince a liberal legislator to join one's coalition    by talking to him or her about conservative proposals. The same logic holds    for the disbursement of resources. Unfortunately, it is often very hard to identify    the true preferences of the actors involved in such negotiations. The literature    has used roll call votes in an attempt to measure such preferences, but I do    not believe this is the only strategy that should be used. Roll calls express    the strategic behavior of political actors <i>ex post facto</i>, after they    have gone through the negotiation-persuasion phase and may have already gained    other political goods from the executive in exchange. Thus, they may not accurately    measure the actors' true preferences. In this paper, I propose a new methodological    solution to this problem. My assumptions are that a legislator's preferences    are given, and they will try to maximize their expectations given their preference    ordering. The challenge is to identify what determines a legislator's preferences.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Studies have postulated that political parties    have three main types of objectives in modern democracies: votes, offices and    policies (Strom 1990; Mueller and Strom 1999). However, the most interesting    finding of such models is the interaction among each of these dimensions. Building    on Strom's arguments, I posit that it is in the interest of parties, after they    reached office, to obtain pork and policies that are compatible with their constituency's    preferences. Therefore, I expect that a member's propensity to support the government    in the legislature is directly related to the sort of resources they are offered    by the governor. In other words, the preferences of legislators are constituted    and constrained by their constituencies' preferences.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, political parties are also the source    of preferences for legislators. Legislators come together in a party through    a shared interest in office (Aldrich 1995) when they agree on policy (Cohen    et al. 2008). Thus, the preferences of individual legislators will reflect the    ideology shared by the group that constitutes their party, either locally or    nationally. As several papers have shown, ideology is still a key distinguisher    of politicians in Brazil (Castro et al. 2009; Power and Zucco Jr. 2009), although    ideology's influence on roll call votes has diminished over time (Zucco Jr.    2009). Thus, it is reasonable to believe that ideology is still a good <i>proxy</i>    for what legislators wish for.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Second, obtaining the support of player X depends    on the way that the government negotiates with X. The difference between hierarchical    or horizontal relationships can often determine the satisfaction with a job    or a deal (Glisson and Durick 1988). Thus, the manner a negotiation is pursued    can influence whether an agreement is ultimately obtained. More often than not,    however, the most important determinant of success is not the approach of the    negotiation, but rather the formal and informal structures of the organization    in question (Campbell et al. 2004). In the government case, the internal organization    of each party, the party system, and the degree of legislative centralization    constrain the president's negotiation strategies. Strong party systems tend    to generate more programmatic negotiations between the players in the competition    (Sartori 1987). Under such conditions, elections become contests about ideology,    and as such, they are organized around party platforms. Voters can distinguish    between parties because they clearly represent different political projects    (McCarty et al. 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Regarding political parties, the more centralized    they are, the larger their staff, the higher their internal cohesion, and the    more important party leaders will be, therefore, they will intervene more in    negotiations (Cox 2005; Mair 2006). According to Mair (2006), parties will become    weaker in the electoral arena but stronger in the parliamentary arena under    these conditions. This empowerment of parties in the legislature made the larger    parties inclined to enlarge their programmatic connections and to enrich their    internal structure, giving more coordination capabilities to party leaders.    Cox (2005) shows how the "state of nature" in legislatures has bad implications    for a government's functionality: without coordination by party leaders and    chairs, Congress tends to be held hostage by filibusters. Thinking of the legislature    as a company, as suggested by Weingast and Marshall (1988), leads many legislatures    to try to create an institutional structure that can generate gains through    trade in a continuous decision-making process with low transactional costs (North    1990). This may result in a robust link between the structure of parties and    the preferences of legislators for various kinds of political negotiations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, when making deals, the relationship    between legislators and the executive is dependent on the ideological position    of the actors in the negotiation. A one-dimensional ideological spectrum is    the classic structure used to understand political behavior. I believe that    it helps to understand the phenomenon that is analyzed here in two ways: first,    parties from different ideological orientations tend to have different types    of constituencies (Ames 2001; Carvalho 2003; Nunes 2009; Zucco Jr. 2009); second,    coalitions with parties that are closer ideologically tend to produce more consistent    and long-term legislative results. As Iversen and Soskice (2006) show, center-left    governments dominate under PR systems, and they also tend to redistribute more.    The mechanism behind the argument is that coalitions representing the poor and    the middle class are easier to be formed in proportional representation systems    than in majoritarian ones. So, it is reasonable to believe that constituencies    of left-centered governments are different from the constituencies of right-centered    governments. The position of the partners along the one-dimensional spectrum    also matters. As argued by Inacio (2006), coalitions in which the inclusion    of participants was based on the smallest ideological distance, and were constructed    ensuring a minimum enlargement of the cabinet, demonstrate higher presidential    legislative success. Under these circumstances, it is easier to solve coordination    problems that result from the heterogeneity of the players' preferences.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Opinions about Coalition Formation Strategies</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What the literature has forgotten so far, however,    is that what is negotiated and how it is negotiated between the Executive and    the Legislative may depend on certain factors that may be a function of a legislator    political profile and/or a party organization. To assess potential features    that might determine how a coalition should be composed, I will use attitude    information based on a survey applied to the political elite. In summary, I    claim legislators' constituency types and ideological positions dictate the    type of resources they care most about, while the degree of centralization adopted    in their political parties influences their preferences for the form of negotiation    with the executive. Such theoretical expectations should be investigated empirically    in order to check their validity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Instead of observing directly, I will investigate    such associations based on deputies' stated preferences and characteristics.    I also believe that parties and the individual attributes of parliamentarians    impact the structure of their preferences. Therefore, my analytical strategy    will be to search for connections between these member's features and their    opinions is based on a survey conducted in 12 Brazilian Assemblies. If variation    within and between the states in parliamentarians' opinions about the efficiency    of the governors' strategies in obtaining legislative support is found, I expect    this will be associated with his or her electoral-party profile.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The electoral-party profile of parliamentarians    refers particularly to (1) his or her constituency, (2) the degree of centralization    of his or her political party, and (3) the ideological position of the party    he or she is a member. I expect that a variation of these three dimensions will    affect the parliamentarians' opinion on the efficiency of the governor's strategies    in the following directions:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 1</u>: <i>if a deputy with    a geographically concentrated constituency prefers to send particularistic benefits    for his/her electoral supporters, then we should expect this kind of deputy    to believe the most efficient way to obtain his/her legislative support is to    give him/her pork or jobs. On the other hand, we should expect deputies with    scattered or universal constituencies to believe that the most efficient strategy    to obtain legislative support by the governor is to form a multiparty cabinet    negotiated with party leaders.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Nunes (2011) has shown, deputies with concentrated    constituencies tend to have leverage over pork appropriations in Brazil, given    their ability to claim credit for investments made in their constituencies.    Legislators with scattered constituencies, on the other hand, use pork appropriations    as a marginal tool to pursue electoral success. Thus, it is expected that the    propensity of members to support the government in the legislature is directly    related to the kind of resources offered to them by the governor. In other words,    the preferences of legislators will be constituted and constrained by their    constituencies' preferences and composition.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 2</u>: <i>if a conservative    deputy tends to be associated with groups that demand targetable goods instead    of universal policies, then we should expect this kind of deputy to believe    the most efficient way a governor might get legislative support is through the    negotiation of pork appropriations with each legislator; whereas deputies positioned    on the left side of the ideological spectrum should believe that the most efficient    strategy to form a multiparty cabinet is to negotiate with party leaders.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is reasonable to believe that ideology is    a proxy for what legislators want in legislatures. Left-wing parties, as representatives    of groups in society, should prefer negotiations based on policies that involve    appointments to the cabinet, while conservative parties, as an organization    of politicians, should prefer pork appropriations for their constituencies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 3</u>: <i>if legislators    who are members of a decentralized party tend to have more flexibility and freedom    to act as independent politicians, then we should expect them to believe the    most efficient way a governor can get legislative support is through the negotiation    of pork appropriations with individual legislators, whereas deputies members    of centralized parties should believe that the most efficient strategy is the    composition of a multi-party cabinet negotiated with party leaders.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When referring to political parties, the following    reasoning applies: the more centralized they are, the more important party leaders    will be, and therefore, the more they will intervene in negotiations (Mair 2006;    Cox 2005). These conclusions should lead us to expect that cabinets will be    formed when leaders are decisive and strong in controlling their benchmark behavior,    while pork will be determinant when parties are decentralized and undisciplined.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although these hypotheses are presented as separate    options, I also treat them in interaction with each other in the empirical test.    By doing so, I expect to observe which systematic effects are due to exclusive    or complementary interaction of variables. I believe, for example, that the    importance of a leader to the composition of a cabinet could annul the effect    of ideology when a leftist legislator is a member of a centralized party.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>The Survey</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The data that will be used to test the relationship    between legislators' perception on coalition formation strategies and legislative    support was collected in twelve subnational Brazilian Assemblies between 2007    and 2008. The research was conducted by a group of researchers from the Legislative    Studies Center at UFMG.<a name="tx6" href="#nt6"><sup>6</sup></a> The aim of    this project was to analyze the arguments and claims made about politics in    Brazil using a different level of government, the states. The empirical strategy    was to produce individual-level information, that is, deputies' opinions. This    project has contributed to the debate on coalition formation in Brazil by overcoming    the limits of roll call analysis. Surveys have never been used in such a way    , and I believe they can add information that has been neglected so far.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is hard to test the arguments I propose here    using observational data on roll call voting. The result of an aggregation of    votes does not tell us how the aggregation of preferences was produced as it    only shows the final position taken by legislators. With my research strategy,    I will be able to identify deputies' preferred relationships with other deputies,    with the executive, with other partisan partners, and finally with their constituencies.    This method circumvents the limits of roll call analysis, which only captures    the last step of the relationship between legislators and the president. I overcome    this limitation by using the deputies' expectations of their relationship with    the president. By doing so, I hope to be identifying the mechanisms that tend    to produce successful aggregation of majorities in legislative bodies as a function    of the chief executive strategy to build them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the 624 deputies that constituted the universe    of analysis, 513 answered the questionnaire. This research project gained attention    because of the lack of studies on subnational legislatives in Brazil and the    need to produce an analysis that could contribute to the knowledge of the behavior,    processes, and legislative law-making in the federated states. All political    regions of Brazil were represented in the sample, including the following states:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The questionnaire contained 112 questions and    the answers were collected face-to-face. The researchers involved in the project    traveled to each state and interviewed all legislators in person at their offices.    Appointments were made in order to guarantee availability for the interviews,    which lasted around 40 minutes each. No one else was present in the office during    the interviews. All personal information of legislators was undisclosed and    no information was associated with specific names. All legislators signed an    agreement allowing the researchers to conduct the interview under these conditions.    All state legislators were contacted but some of them refused to participate    in the research and, therefore, are not in the sample. To avoid selection bias    in my results, I ran a logit model to check whether being in or out of the sample    (dependent variable) was associated with any of my independent variables. None    of the coefficients were statistically significant, which suggests that I am    using a sufficiently randomized sample.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Dependent Variable: Strategy to Obtain    Legislative Support</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The questionnaire had two questions that dealt    specifically with the obtainment of legislative support. The first one concerned    the way in which the governor negotiates with the legislature: with party leaders    or individual legislators. The second question is about the kind of resources    used by the governor to obtain legislative support: office positions or pork    appropriations. In order to test my hypothesis I recoded both questions into    one in such a way that all choices I am interested in were covered.<a name="tx7" href="#nt7"><sup>7</sup></a>    The results are presented in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04tab2.jpg">Table 2</a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is significant variation in the legislators'    opinion of the most efficient strategy to obtain legislative support. Most members    believe that the most efficient strategy is the negotiation of pork appropriations    with party leaders, followed by portfolio negotiation with party leaders and    negotiation of pork with individual legislators. The table also reveals the    legislators' preference for negotiations involving party leaders: 52.4% of deputies    believe this is the governor's best strategy to obtain legislative support.    This evidence supports the argument that political parties also matter in subnational    assemblies (Nunes 2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We can also observe variation of legislators'    opinions by state assembly (see <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04fig1.jpg">Figure 1</a>). The deputies of the two largest states    in Brazil, S&atilde;o Paulo (SP) and Minas Gerais (MG), believe the governor's    best strategy to obtain legislative support is to negotiate pork with party    leaders. Legislators from highly competitive states (Castro et al. 2009), such    as Bahia (BA) and Rio Grande do Sul (RS), however, believe cabinet formation    is the best strategy. In poor states like Cear&aacute; (CE) and Tocantins (TO),    the negotiation of pork with individual legislators seems to be the most widely    chosen option.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If there are different opinions regarding the    strategies and resources offered in exchange for legislative support, then the    governor must use different strategies to address various groups of potential    allies. The challenge for the governor, therefore, is not to replicate what    previous governments have done, but instead to follow a strategy that would    give him the best utility in terms of legislative outcome. In order to match    what is offered to the actors in each state political context, governors have    to pay careful attention to actors' profiles. As I argue, they are the source    of legislators' preferences for negotiation and resources. More importantly,    it is not the offer that guarantees legislative success, but the acceptance    of it.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Independent Variables: Constituencies, Ideology    and Party Centralization</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As previously indicated, I expect that legislators'    opinions about the Executive's most efficient strategy to obtain legislative    support will vary in three dimensions: (1) type of constituency, (2) degree    of centralization of the political party, and (3) party ideological position.    I believe that the combination of these factors would result in different types    of optimal strategies for the governor, determining the composition of majorities,    and the pattern of relationship between the Executive and the Legislative.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first dimension explored in the questionnaire    was the type of the legislators' constituency. Respondents had five options    that were later recoded into three: (1) concentrated geographical constituency    (concentrated constituency), (2) interest groups, and (3) the whole population    of the district (scattered constituency). A geographical electorate is characterized    by electoral support from specific areas within a district. They are usually    sets of municipalities where legislators have had previous political experience,    for instance, as a mayor. Constituencies of interest groups are formed around    specific issues, and are typically composed of community leaders, unions, businessmen,    churches, and other segments of society. A dispersed constituency is marked    by a lack of specific identification with one or more groups or geographical    areas. Legislators with dispersed constituencies typically have electoral support    spread throughout the whole district. They are important and famous names in    the party's list. The distribution of constituencies by state and party is presented    in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04fig2.jpg">Figure 2</a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04fig2.jpg">Figure 2</a> shows that the majority of members stated    they were elected by geographical constituencies (57.7%). This is true for all    states investigated here. The remaining two categories have almost the same    proportion of answers. Legislators with spread or dispersed constituencies represent    23% of the sample, whereas legislators linked to interest groups represent 19.3%.    These results are different from the ones obtained for the national Congress.    Similar studies investigating the national Congress show the majority of national    legislators with scattered constituencies (Ames 2001; Carvalho 2003; Nunes 2011).    There is no reason to believe that legislators are misunderstanding the questions,    nor that they do not know what kind of constituency they really represent. Unfortunately,    there is no empirical work showing what kind of constituency state legislators    have; therefore, I must assume that legislators are answering sincerely.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second dimension explored in the questionnaire    was the degree of political party centralization. Instead of directly asking    whether leaders control parties, this aspect was measured by asking legislators    to evaluate the power of their party leaders: weak, moderate, or strong. It    is important to note that this question was not asked to party leaders, who    made up 25% of the sample. I use their evaluations to classify centralized (strong    leaders) and decentralized (weak leaders) party organizations. The distribution    by state is presented in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04fig3.jpg">Figure 3</a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The variation of party centralization by state    is also very interesting. Overall, legislators' perception of party centralization    is split: 34.5% believe that their parties are decentralized while 39% claim    that party leaders are strong, and therefore their party is centralized. When    I disaggregate information by state, we can see almost the same pattern. In    several states, part of the legislators sees their parties as decentralized,    and part as centralized. The largest differences are observed in Bahia (BA),    Pernambuco (PE), and S&atilde;o Paulo. As this measurement is just an approximation    of the centralization dimension that I want to study, I also checked the variation    of the responses by party and state. The results show that, in general, legislators    have cohesive perceptions about their party organizations. The standard deviation    for each group is not very high.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The last dimension explored in the questionnaire    was the ideological position of legislators. In order to measure ideology, we    built an ideological scale from 1 (left) to 10 (right), and asked legislators    to position themselves on it. Other researchers interested in studying ideology    in Brazil have also used such a strategy to capture inter- and intraparty variation    (Castro et al. 2009; Melo and Nunes 2009; Power and Zucco Jr. 2009). Moreover,    the continuous measurement of ideology provides a more granular measure than    a discrete one (left-center-right).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The distribution of ideology by state is presented    in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04fig4.jpg">Figure 4</a>. The distributions are very similar to a classical normal curve.    This implies that the majority of legislators position themselves at the center    of the ideological distribution, highlighting their importance to a government    coalition.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04fig5.jpg">Figure 5</a> represents the average ideological position    of the set of legislators for each political party. The distribution is very    similar to the one presented in a paper about ideology in Brazil (Power and    Zucco Jr. 2009). I excluded small parties from the figure as they do not contribute    to the visualization of the information. After this exclusion, we see that PT    is the furthest left-wing party on the spectrum, and PR is the furthest on the    right.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So far, I have presented the main variables that    I will be using in my analysis, but my model also includes other control variables:    (1) government and opposition affinity, (2) type of relationship between government    and opposition, (3) first term, (4) gender, and (5) schooling years. The summary    of the variables is presented in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04tab3.jpg">Table 3</a> below.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Multinomial Logit Model</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When a dependent variable is discrete (such as    governor's strategy to obtain legislative support), OLS estimation is not appropriate    because basic assumptions of OLS are violated, as shown by Pindyck and Rubinfeld    (1981) and Greene (2008). To avoid these problems, researchers convert the discrete    variable - the executive's strategy for dealing with legislators, in this case    - into a continuous variable, such as the probability of preferring one strategy    to another. The next step is to choose an appropriate functional form to estimate    this probability. A linear probability model may underestimate the true regression    slope when there are many observations characterized by extreme values of choice    probability (0 and 1). This specification bias cannot be corrected by using    a nonlinear estimation procedure, however. Given that all probabilities lie    between 0 and 1, the use of the cumulative probability function should provide    the most acceptable transformation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because the number of strategies available to    governors to obtain legislative support (my dependent variable) is greater than    four, a multinomial qualitative model would render useful information that is    somewhat different from that obtained in binary logit or probit models. Therefore,    I could choose to implement either a multinomial logit or probit model. The    multinomial probit has some attractive features, including a normally distributed    error term, easily interpreted results, and the provision of general patterns    of cross-elasticity (King 1998; Greene 2008; Wooldridge 2010). However, the    multinomial probit can be applied only when there is a small number of alternatives    (usually three) because for categories of four or more, numerical integration    is too costly for practical application in iterating likelihood maximization    (McFadden 1984). For example, multivariate integrals are required for many alternatives.    Therefore, this technique may not be appropriate to analyze the determinants    of a governor's strategy as this would involve five different categories in    this analysis.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the other hand, given its relative computational    ease, multinomial logit has been widely used, even though the error term has    a logistic distribution and the restrictions of the "independence of irrelevant    alternatives" assumption (Wooldridge 2010). My goal in this paper is to use    the multinomial logit (MNL) model to identify the major determinants of the    opinions that legislators have concerning the governor's strategies to achieve    legislative success.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let <i>y</i> denote a random variable taking    on the values {0,1,...,<i>J</i>} where <i>J</i> is a positive integer, and let    <b>x</b> denote a set of conditioning variables.

I assume that (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) is a random draw from the population.    As in binary response models, we are interested in how changes in the elements    of <b>x</b> affect the response probabilities, P(<i>y</i> = <i>j</i> | <b>x</b>),    <i>j</i> = 0,1,2,....,<i>J</i> .

Then,    we estimate the log of the odds of one strategy versus another as a linear function    of the explanatory variables.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Empirical Results</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The empirical results of the multinomial logit    estimation are shown in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04tab3.jpg">Table 3</a>. To make interpretation easier, I have calculated    the log-odds for the substantive comparison that I want to make here, i.e. the    comparison between D, negotiation of pork with deputies, and E, negotiations    of portfolios with party leaders (see last column in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04tab4.jpg">Table 4</a>). Formally speaking,    such comparison is possible given that the coefficients that we estimate using    the MNL method can be interpreted as the effects on the log of the odds ratio    between each given category and the excluded category. Therefore, we can find    the difference between two categories by subtracting their log-odds from one    to another (Greene 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Standard Errors are in parenthesis. All controls    are included (deputy position in regard to the government, type of competition    between government and opposition, first term, gender, and school years) and    each regression includes state fixed effects.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Log-odds for Portfolio-leader/Pork-deputy estimated    by non-parametric bootstrap in R 2.15.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The MNL model predicts that legislators with    concentrated constituencies tend to believe the best strategy for the governor    to obtain legislative support is to negotiate pork with individual deputies.    The model also predicts that legislators with scattered constituencies tend    to believe that the governor's best strategy to obtain legislative support is    by means of negotiating portfolios - meaning building a multiparty cabinet.    The centralization of a political party is associated with strategy A, negotiation    of portfolios with deputies. Finally, conservative legislators tend to prefer    negotiations of pork. The general outcome for constituency and ideology is consistent    with my expectations, but the effect of centralization is not strong enough    to be conclusive (see <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04tab4.jpg">Table 4</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But more important than the results of the four    first columns in Table3 is the direct comparison between the negotiation of    pork with deputies and the negotiation of portfolios with party leaders (see    column C/D in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04tab4.jpg">Table 4</a>). The reason being the literature on executive-legislative    relations in Brazil has shown that these two strategies are the most common    strategies that presidents have used to build their coalitions (Aleman and Tsebelis    2002; Altman 2000; Ames 2001; Amorim Neto 2006a; Amorim Neto and Santos 2003;    Figueiredo and Limongi 1999; Inacio 2006; Morgenstern 2004; Nunes 2011; Pereira    and Mueller 2004; Santos 2003; Raile et al. 2010; Zucco Jr. 2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The results for the direct comparison between    the negotiation of pork with deputies and the negotiation of portfolios with    party leaders suggest that legislators prefer the first option over the second    if they have a concentrated constituency, are members of centralized parties,    and classify themselves as conservatives. Excluding the centralization effect    again, the other two variables correlate with the governor's strategies as expected.    Although the magnitude and direction of such coefficients are related to my    theory, the confidence intervals are too large, decreasing the accuracy of my    estimations. This is likely due to the size of my sample as I set the model    for each category. A substantive interpretation of such results, then, is a    better approach for understanding the relevance of these outcomes.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Next, I analyze the likelihood of the legislators'    preferences given different values of ideology and centralization, and excluding    the fixed effects for each state. As <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04fig6.jpg">Figure 6</a> shows, left-wing legislators believe    that the governor's best strategy to obtain legislative support is to negotiate    portfolios, but only when their constituencies are scattered. The attitude towards    party leaders is stronger among deputies in general, but it is especially strong    among right-wing deputies. This result shows the predominance of ideological    position over constituency and party structure in predicting legislators' opinions    about the ideal type of relationship with governors. The exception, however,    is the group of left-wing legislators with scattered constituencies and centralized    parties. For them, negotiations of portfolio are better and should be pursued    between individual deputies and the government. For conservatives, on the other    hand, the most efficient way for a governor to obtain legislative support is    by negotiating pork with party leaders. This result contradicts the conventional    wisdom, as a large part of the literature does not claim such strategy. Therefore,    it looks like party leaders are very important actors in right-wing parties    as they are seen as efficient brokers between governors and deputies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the comparison of strategies C (blue line)    and D (purple line), we observe that conservative legislators with concentrated    constituencies tend to prefer negotiations of pork much more often than conservative    legislators with scattered constituencies. Portfolio is preferred as a resource    by deputies with scattered constituencies a lot more than by deputies with concentrated    constituencies. In the case of legislators with scattered constituencies and    members of centralized political parties, it is remarkable how the lines of    portfolio/deputy and pork/deputy cross each other, suggesting , again, the preference    of pork by right-wing legislators, and the preference of portfolios by left-wing    deputies. It also calls the attention the fact that the strategy pork/deputy    is considered more effective by deputies from right-wing parties with scattered    constituencies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In general, <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a04fig6.jpg">Figure 6</a> shows that depending on    the combination of certain features of political profiles, we should expect    different utilities from legislators as measured by their opinions/preferences.    Conservatives with concentrated constituencies tend to prefer party negotiations    involving pork. Liberals representing interest groups are more satisfied with    cabinet formation. Moderates in centralized parties prefer negotiations of pork    with party leaders. Representatives of scattered coalitions identified as conservatives    prefer party negotiations for pork. And finally, liberal legislators that represent    regional interests are more prone to accept supporting the governor when pork    is negotiated with party leaders.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What do these results suggest after all? First,    the three dimensions explored in this work affect the probability of a parliamentary    opinion on the governor's best strategy to obtain legislative support. As expected,    the profile of legislators seems to influence their opinions about the relationship    with the executive. This may imply, consequentially, that the profile of deputies    also influences the utility functions of legislators when negotiating support    with the governor. Thus, the findings support the argument that there is variation    to be explained regarding not only the relationship between the executive and    the legislature but also the achievement of successful coalitions. Second, although    I have not explored an additional plausible strategy - namely the negotiation    for policies rather than resources (Cheibub et al. 2004) -, it seems credible    to assert that resources and policies can have different effects on players'    preferences. It will be profitable to investigate how in future research.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Final Considerations</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This paper examined the hypothesis that the opinion    legislators form about the most efficient strategy for a governor to obtain    legislative support is linked to his political profile. Rather than explaining    the composition of a government coalitions only through the lens of its own    characteristics, such as ideological contiguity, size of opposition, number    of parties, or different types of offices, this paper has shown that governors    must concern themselves with the characteristics of their potential allies in    coalitions as well. Studying the legislators' profiles can help governors to    build efficient coalitions, where more political support is gained for a lower    price.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another contribution of this paper relies on    the estimates provided by a multinomial logit model using survey data from legislators    in Brazilian State Assemblies. There are several benefits of using a survey    for this kind of analysis and the most salient is to overcome the limits of    roll call data. With a survey, the researcher captures better the sincere preference    of legislators, something almost impossible to obtain from roll call votes.    The survey also allows the researcher to create specific questions to capture    nuances that have empirical and theoretical importance. By using roll calls,    a researcher is limited to examining the legislator's <i>ex post facto </i>preferences.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first interesting pattern I presented concerned    the variation of legislator's opinions on the governor's best strategies to    obtain legislative support. Although a majority prefers negotiations of pork    with party leaders, all five categories have similar proportions. The analysis    also called the attention to the importance that legislators ascribe to political    parties. More than 50% of legislators believe that parties are the best way    to successful negotiations between the Executive and the Legislative. In future    research, I would like to investigate the residual strategies that were recoded    into one category.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Next, I described the distribution of the legislators'    constituency types, the levels of party centralization and the ideological position    in every state investigated. I observed very similar patterns for each variable.    I was especially impressed with the distribution of ideology across all twelve    states. Almost all cases approach a normal distribution, with radical positions    being rare in the assemblies. The classification of parties into one unique    dimension also deserves to be highlighted. As many other studies on ideology    in Brazil have noted, both the classification and the ordering of parties seems    to be very stable.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, I tested three hypotheses about the    possible relationships between legislators' profiles and their attitudes regarding    the governors' strategies to negotiate legislative support. Except for party    centralization, all remaining hypotheses could not be rejected based on the    available data. First of all, members of dispersed constituencies that self-classified    themselves as liberals are more likely to believe that the best governor's strategy    to obtain legislative support is to negotiate portfolios with party leaders.    Liberal legislators from concentrated constituencies, on the other hand, are    more likely to prefer individual negotiations for pork. Party centralization,    contrary to what I expected, tends to be associated with negotiations involving    pork and individual legislators, not portfolios and leaders.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In conclusion, my results point towards an analytical    perspective that takes into account not only discrete choices, but interactive    ones as well. Instead of seeing presidents or governors as players trying to    maximize one or the other strategy, my empirical outcomes suggest that they    do both at the same time. Pork is more efficient for some allies whereas portfolios    are more useful to others. Some prefer direct negotiations and others believe    that the best strategy to build a successful coalition is to form a multiparty    cabinet. In other words, different allies are attracted by different offers,    therefore this leads executives to choose optimal strategies for different negotiations.    This result directly contradicts the notion that only one strategy prevails    in all cases. The received wisdom from the existing literature missed most of    the complexity that involves negotiations between the executive and the legislature,    especially in fragmented party systems.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aldrich, J. 1995. <i>Why Parties?

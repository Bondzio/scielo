In this work, I analyse the identities of sexual, ethnic and cultural roots, in the light of the historic process that intended to supress them - without success, in fact, as has now been proved. With regard, I refer to the romantic and marxist replies of the reductionism carried out by modernity in its hegemonic version. I give special care to the question of Portuguese cultural identity and propose a work hypothesis on its characterization.

Abstract: In Brazil, public food security policies include the National School Feeding Programme (PNAE), the Food Acquisition Program (PAA) and the Agricultural Production Acquisition Program of the Federal District (PAPA-DF). This study analyzed the impact of the latter (Papa/DF) on the adoption of management practices and of most appropriate production technologies by a group of farmers who participate in this policy, as these innovations have recognized relationship with their performance. The baseline was obtained from a 2009 data on these producers. In 2016, producers participating in Papa/DF were interviewed, applying a questionnaire likewise the one used in 2009, to identify changes in management and production processes, from 2009 to 2016. The results indicate positive changes in management innovation (planning and management processes) and technological innovation (adoption of recommended technologies) in these systems and on variables that can influence such results (production and producer characteristics).

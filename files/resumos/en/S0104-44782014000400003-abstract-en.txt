This article analyses the 1810-1914 Argentine economic elite's most salient features. The most important interpretations on the history and characteristics of this group are discussed, drawing attention to the major strenghts and limitations of different theoretical and empirical schools of analysis. Even though this article focuses on the economic elite, it also pays some attention to the state and the economic environment in which wealthy capitalists were forced to act. It suggests that state and market need to be taken into account in order to understand the basic characteristics of this group. This paper suggests that the analysis of the economic elite has paid too much attention to the realm of politics, and that economic structures need to be given more analytical weight. Rather than new information or data, this paper offers a discussion of current and past literature.

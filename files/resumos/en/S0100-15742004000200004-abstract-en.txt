The article aims to discuss some features of the postmodern agenda and the possible vitality of this trend of thought nowadays. The main framework of the article are the ideas presented in some of the author's previous essays (1996, 1997, 1998, 2003) where she sustains a critical position concerning the various "post" trends and emphasizes their epistemological relativism, their suspicion of the objective knowledge and their mistrust on the structured character of things and of the world. In the first part, the article recalls the ideas exposed in the works published in 1996 and 1998, and outlines the beginnings of the "post" agenda and of some of its developments, in particular the linguistic turn and the suppression of the boundaries between History and Literature; in the second part, it summarizes the analyses of Richard Rorty's neopragmatism, previously introduced in the texts of 1998 and 2003. Finally, the article indicates the impacts of this broad agenda on educational practices and on educational research.

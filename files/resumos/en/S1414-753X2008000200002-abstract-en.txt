This article focuses on the implementation of Territorial Farm Contracts (TFCs) in French agriculture. These were set up during the government of Lionel Jospin, by the 1999 Agricultural Orientation Act in order to introduce changes in both farming policy and individual strategies of farmers. Unfortunately, the TFCs did not receive the necessary social and economic support to hold against the opposition from the lobby of French agrarian corporatives (FNSEA and CNJA).

This article aims to contribute to the recent debate of environmental and climate change at local level. Drawing on qualitative research in São Paulo city, we seek to comprehend how people understand and perceive (or not) environmental and climate change in their daily life, in particular whom are living in densely populated urban areas where climate issues may bring a set of hazards that would further exacerbate the urban problems and risks. In this analysis, we consider some specificities of São Paulo (including specificities of two neighborhoods which have been studied in depth), and make references to reflections and critical perspectives from Human Sciences. In this movement of responses to urban and climate issues, we seek to highlight the role of local communities, who are central to the societal and environmental changes to deal with the approaching crisis.

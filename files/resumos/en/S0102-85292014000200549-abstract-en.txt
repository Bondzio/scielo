The paper aims to discuss the Latin American integration process with focus on the Brazilian positions, in order to understand the elements of continuity between the actions of the early years of the Republic, particularly the period of the Baron of Rio Branco (1902-1912), and the current years. There is a search for the roots of Brazilian policy towards regional integration, which in the eighties of the last century resulted in the Mercosur proposal. Brazilian positions in relation to its neighbors will be analyzed considering the experiments of policy coordination that sought to maximize the interests of the countries in the region.

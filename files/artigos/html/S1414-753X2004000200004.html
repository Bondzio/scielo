GOES examines the cultural impact from    a basic cross-national perspective, investigating the impact of cultural change    and value shifts on environmental concern, attitudes, and behavior in both Western    and non-Western societies. This study provides cross-national insights in how    mass publics and decision makers in both developed and developing countries    frame environmental problems and solutions. In addition, the project has shown    how leading environmental decision makers and opinion leaders assess the environmental    beliefs and attitudes of the public.    <br>   Apparently,    citizens are not yet ready to translate pro-environmental concerns into acceptance    of far-reaching environmental policy measures. Citizens in both developed and    developing countries seem to prefer voluntary lifestyle changes. Moving from    environmental concern via policy support to actual (reported) environmental    behavior, we can conclude that persistent pro-environmental behavior does not    describe citizens' environmental involvement and commitment. Our data indicate    that environmentally relevant behaviors (e.g., transportation, energy use, recycling,    household purchases, political activism) do not form a consistent and coherent    pattern. Practice of one type of ecologically conscious behavior does not predict    engagement in another. It is not that people reserve a distinctive spot in their    mental software for judging the environmental impact of habitual behaviors.    Their mental mapping probably consists of manifold decisional heuristics, including    comfort, health, safety, price, efficiency, effectiveness, and social responsibility,    which are likely to be hierarchically ordered and in competition with environmental    heuristics. A focus on specific behaviors, though, reveals that citizens may    be deeply involved in "green" behavior. This is related in part to differences    in opportunity structures, social situation and, arguably, cultural differences    in exposure to green ideas. The policy lesson from this is not to prompt "general"    environmentally friendly consumer behavior, but to promote single citizen actions    having positive environmental impacts and, certainly, to create appropriate    opportunity structures.    <br>   In addition    to the general national sample GOES study, an additional decision makers' module    addressed the following questions, among others: Is there a systematic bias    in environmental decision makers' estimates of environmental attitudes and environmental    policy preferences of the general public? How do decision makers value a number    of policies that are direct implementations of international environmental treaties,    and how do they judge their own national performance in this respect?    <br>   <i>The new    module enabled us to study differences between environmental decision makers    and general public attitudes and policy preferences in the environmental policy    arena, and we did find some remarkable and systematic cross-national biases    in decision makers' competence of estimating the general public's environmental    beliefs and policy support.    <br>   </i>These    biases, interestingly, are related to issues at the core of the sustainability    debate.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords:</b>    environmental attitudes and behavior, values, culture.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">O foco principal    deste estudo &#150; o Global Environsmental Survey (GOES) - &eacute; o impacto das    influ&ecirc;ncias culturais sobre as atitudes ambientais. O GOES examina os    impactos culturais a partir de uma perspectiva comparativa internacional, investigando    as implica&ccedil;&otilde;es da mudan&ccedil;a cultural e de valores sobre a    percep&ccedil;&atilde;o, atitudes e comportamentos ambientais em sociedades    ocidentais e n&atilde;o-ocidentais. Este estudo lan&ccedil;a luzes no entendimento    de como as popula&ccedil;&otilde;es e os <i>"decision makers"</i>, tanto em    sociedades desenvolvidas quanto em desenvolvimento, concebem os problemas ambientais    e suas poss&iacute;veis solu&ccedil;&otilde;es. Adicionalmente, o estudo mostra    como os <i>"decision makers"</i> ambientais e formadores de opini&atilde;o avaliam    as atitudes e comportamentos ambientais da popula&ccedil;&atilde;o em geral.    <br>   Aparentemente,    as pessoas ainda n&atilde;o est&atilde;o prontas para traduzir suas preocupa&ccedil;&otilde;es    com o meio ambiente em apoio a pol&iacute;ticas ambientais de maior alcance.    Tanto em pa&iacute;ses desenvolvidos quanto naqueles em desenvolvimento, os    cidad&atilde;o parecem preferir mudan&ccedil;as volunt&aacute;rias em seus modos    de vida. Indo al&eacute;m da preocupa&ccedil;&atilde;o com o meio ambiente via    apoio a pol&iacute;ticas p&uacute;blicas para a ado&ccedil;&atilde;o de comportamentos    ambientais, n&oacute;s podemos concluir que um comportamento pr&oacute;-ambiental    consistente n&atilde;o descreve o envolvimento e compromissos ambientais das    pessoas. Nossos dados indicam que comportamentos ambientalmente relevantes (por    exemplo: transporte, uso de energia, reciclagem, consumo dom&eacute;stico, ativismo    politico) n&atilde;o formam um padr&atilde;o consistente e coerente. A pr&aacute;tica    de um tipo de comportamento ecologicamente consciente n&atilde;o prediz o engajamento    em outro. O mapeamento mental dos indiv&iacute;duos consiste de uma heur&iacute;stica    de decis&atilde;o multifacetada, incluindo conforto, sa&uacute;de, seguran&ccedil;a,    pre&ccedil;o, efici&ecirc;ncia, efici&ecirc;ncia, e responsibilidaded social,    que provavelmente est&atilde;o hierarquicamente ordenados e em competi&ccedil;&atilde;o    com a heur&iacute;stica ambiental. O foco em comportamentos espec&iacute;ficos,    no entanto, revela que os cidad&atilde;os podem estar ativamente envolvidos    com o "comportamento verde". Isto est&aacute; relacionado em parte com diferen&ccedil;as    em estruturas de oportunidades, situa&ccedil;&atilde;o social, e, poss&iacute;velmente,    a diferen&ccedil;as culturais quanto &agrave; exposi&ccedil;&atilde;o &agrave;s    "id&eacute;ias verdes".

Estas distor&ccedil;&otilde;es, curiosamente,    est&atilde;o relacionadas a quest&otilde;es centrais ao debate sobre sustentabilidade.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palavras-chave:</b>    atitudes e comportamento ambiental, valores, cultura.</font></p>  <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The evidence continues    to accumulate: cultural factors exercise a considerable impact on public attitudes    and behaviors toward the environment and the way the public frames environmental    issues (e.g., DUNLAP, GALLUP &amp; GALLUP, 1993a; INGLEHART, 1990, 1995, 1997;    KEMPTON, BOSTER &amp; HARTLEY, 1995; STERN, DIETZ &amp; GUAGNANO, 1995, 1998;    STERN, DIETZ, KALOF &amp; GUAGNANO, 1995). In many cultures, fundamental value    changes have evoked growing environmental concern together with public support    for environmental protection. In addition to meeting the objective challenge    of environmental degradation, cultural value changes have provoked public expression    of concern and determined their willingness to make sacrifices and to undertake    actions to help protect the environment. Research indicates that value change    in particular cultural regions, for example northwestern Europe, gave rise to    the highest level of environmental consciousness and environmental protection    support in the world, despite the relatively low objective pollution level in    these regions (cf. Inglehart 1995, 1997). Gradual cultural change, associated    with growing prosperity and material security, has generated publics highly    sensitive to environmental problems.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But this heightened    environmental awareness among citizens is only one result of cultural change.    These same culture shifts are closely linked with increasing energy consumption    levels. Paradoxically, the growing public level of environmental concern and    willingness to support environmental action is rising simultaneously with energy    consumption levels and use of scarce resources. Values, too, play a major role    in the development of this paradox. Research in many modern, postindustrial    societies delineates that people place higher emphases on the basic values of    personal freedom, personal development, and personal responsibility (e.g., ESTER    &amp; HALMAN 1994; VINKEN, ESTER, &amp; DE BONT 1997). This changing motivational    make-up, summarized in the term <i>"individualization"</i>, has strongly influenced    human activities. Moreover, these basic value shifts have transformed entire    lifestyles, consumption patterns, fertility rates, and household sizes. Compliance    with the basic motivation to fulfill salient personal goals goes hand-in-hand    with human behavior that places higher claims on energy resources.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paradox is    a classic theme in environmental politics. Political and policy interventions    designed to solve environmental problems are unlikely to succeed unless they    account for this paradox (cf. ESTER &amp; MANDEMAKER 1994; ESTER, VINKEN, &amp;    VAN DER STRAATEN 1999). Understanding the impact of values and their influence    on environment-related attitudes and behaviors is the ultimate prerequisite    for the development and implementation of environmental policies. The identification    of motivations underlying public support or opposition to a given set of environmental    policies will indicate how solid or fluid this support or opposition is and    will offer basic insight into considerations that may alter supportive or oppositional    orientations. Thus, taking account of the cultural factor is essential both    in studying environmental issues and in dealing with environmental problems.    Providing policymakers and opinion leaders in the environmental arena with feedback    on the cultural factor is one of the two main goals of the cross-cultural Global    Environmental Survey (GOES) project.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another major goal is to clarify a set of theoretical issues involving the linkage between environmentally relevant values, attitudes, and behaviors. Research carried out in many countries indicates that particular values directed at societal goals have a strong impact on environmentally related political action. Results show that these values exercise a more powerful influence on environmentally relevant political behavior than do particular attitudes (e.g., attitudes toward the severity and danger of environmental problems). A second line of research associates personal life goal values with pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. Until now, these two lines of research have remained relatively separated. They have neither been theoretically integrated, nor have they been empirically tested simultaneously. The GOES project aims to demonstrate the overlap or complement of the two approaches in explaining environmentally relevant behavior. Moreover, GOES studies environmental behavior in a much broader perspective. Most of the environmental research projects that associate values, attitudes, and behaviors are limited to political action willingness. Only a few studies have examined the (direct or indirect) influence of values on energy use and consumer behavior.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the main    focus of the GOES project is the impact of cultural influences on environmental    attitudes. GOES examines the cultural impact from a basic cross-national perspective,    investigating the impact of cultural change and value shifts on environmental    concern, attitudes, and behavior in countries located on several continents.    The main scientific tool applied was a large-scale, standardized questionnaire    on environmental values, concern, attitudes, and behaviors. It was fielded among    representative samples of populations and environmental decision makers in both    Western and non-Western societies. First, we will examine trends observed in    social-scientific environmental survey research in the last three decades. Following    this, we detect important remaining questions that inspired the GOES project.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CHANGING VALUES,    ATTITUDES, AND BEHAVIORS</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interest for    public environmental concern boomed from the 1970s onwards (JOHANSSON, 1995:    319). An increasing number of surveys, conducted by both commercial polling    agencies and independent groups of academic social scientists, emerged, measuring    public attitudes toward environmental issues. Since the late 1980s, the geographical    scope of these surveys has widened strongly, covering not only advanced industrial    and post-communist societies, but also developing societies or metropolitan    areas within developing societies (e.g., the Harris UN Survey, Gallup's Health    of the Planet Survey, the ISSP-Environmental and Reap Module, and the World    Values Survey). In some of these "global" surveys, environmental attitudes are    of but secondary interest, and in other survey studies the measured range of    environmentally relevant values, attitudes, and behaviors is particularly slim.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back01"><sup>1</sup></a>    In this section, which is by necessity a concise one, we deal with evidence    regarding change in values, attitudes, and behaviors drawn from prime national    and cross-national surveys that preceded and inspired GOES.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sim&otilde;es (2001)    describes how most survey analysts seek description, understanding, and explanation    of the individual response to environmental change through an equation comprising    values, beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, and behavior related to environmental    issues. Central to the discussion regarding public environmental attitudes is    the concern for changes in the quality of the environment at global, national,    and local levels (DUNLAP &amp; MICHELSON, 2000) and the impact of this concern    on pro-environmental behavioral routines. Since the first Club of Rome report    in the early 1970s (MEADOWS et al. 1972), the public has become increasingly    aware of ecological problems emerging in modernizing societies (e.g., ESTER,    HALMAN &amp; SEUREN 1993). A wide range of subsequent social psychological,    political science, and sociological studies focused on the relationship between    environmental concern and environmentally friendly behaviors (e.g., offering    willingness, environmental action readiness, likelihood to recycle, prudence    in waste treatment, and inclination to change toward a "green" consumption pattern    and lifestyle; see ESTER 1979 a,b; ESTER, HALMAN &amp; SEUREN 1996; NELISSEN    &amp; SCHEEPERS 1992; VAN DER MEER 1980). However, results show that the parallel    between environmental concern and pro-environmental behavior is not uncontested.    Many studies indicate that individuals with a high level of environmental concern    are not necessarily characterized by strong adherence to environmentally friendly    behavior (e.g., STEG, 1999). Basically, the attitude-behavior consistency depends    strongly on the individual's perception of control of the behavior in question    (see such classic authors as BANDURA, 1977, 1986, and AJZEN &amp; FISHBEIN 1980;    see also BECKERS, ESTER &amp; SPARGAAREN 1999). Behavioral control, related    to the concept of self-efficacy, seems to be a major correlate of environmental    attitudes and behaviors, although the relationship between these attitudes and    behaviors is far from conclusively defined in existing research (see BECKERS,    ESTER &amp; SPAARGAREN 1999).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concern regarding    environmental problems is part of a structure of attitudes that in turn is based    in values. Different environmental problems may touch upon different values;    hence the public has the opportunity to demonstrate pro-environmental attitudes    toward one set of environmental problems and contra-environmental ones toward    another set of problems, dependent on the value or values in which the environmental    problem is based. One influential factor determining the relationship between    public sentiment about the present or future state of the environment and the    repertoire of environmentally relevant behaviors is, therefore, found in the    domain of values. German sociologist Ulrich Beck penned the classic text <u>Risk    Society</u> (1992), which addresses the relationship between public sentiment,    environmentally relevant behaviors, and values. Beck linked the environmental    issue to the very heart of the modernization process. In modern industrialized    societies based on the logic of distributing wealth, he explained, environmental    deterioration is seen as a "negative side effect." The production and development    of risks to global, supra-national, and nonclass-specific hazards is characteristic    of postindustrial society, which is based on the logic of diminishing and distributing    risks. Risks such as those associated with environmental problems were once    considered side effects but now have become focal themes with which the public    strongly identifies. Thus it has begun to strive for economic development under    stricter conditions.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back02"><sup>2</sup></a> The    prerequisite for changing toward a "reflexive society," a society in which people    and institutions are less restricted by classical social divisions and can actively    deal with the risks that are now in the center of attention, is a successful    modernization in terms of material welfare for a large share of the population.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This line of reasoning    is also found in the widely cited value theory of the American political scientist    Ron Inglehart (1977, 1990, 1997). Modernizing societies undergo a shift from    materialist to postmaterialist values, according to Inglehart, and this shift    is underpinned by rapid economic growth and the expansion of welfare states.    Cohorts arising and socialized in periods of severe economic and physical insecurity    emphasize materialist values in which high priority is placed on economic growth    and political stability. However, younger generations are born under the affluence    of post-war industrial societies. For these generations, self-expression and    quality of life, both postmaterialist values, are given highest priority. In    theory, these value emphases and priorities last throughout the cohorts' life    span,<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back03"><sup>3</sup></a> and generational    replacement colors advanced societies in an increasingly postmaterialist shade.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>    Strongly related to postmaterialist values is concern for a darker side of the    old industrial society that poses a threat to efforts toward higher quality    of life: environmental deterioration. Postmaterialists appear very concerned    about the environment and are most willing to take action (e.g., INGLEHART,    1995; INGLEHART &amp; RABI&Eacute;R 1986). However, Inglehart's theory has met    with extensive comments from environmental sociologists (e.g., DUNLAP &amp;    MERTIG 1995, 1996). They have especially questioned the alleged relationship    between economic affluence and pro-environmental attitudes. Environmental concern,    according to the critics, is not a luxury afforded only by societies characterized    by economic security. They seek to show that, contrary to the suggestions of    Inglehart and conventional wisdom, many correlates of environmental attitudes    (including personal concern for environmental problems and economic parameters,    such as GNP per capita) are negative or merely absent (see, e.g., DUNLAP &amp;    MERTIG, 1996: 155).<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One critic, Riley    Dunlap, has hypothesized with his co-authors the likelihood of an emerging "New    Ecological Paradigm" (Dunlap &amp; Van Liere 1978, 1984; Olsen, Lodwick &amp;    Dunlap 1992).<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a> This paradigm    builds on the relationship of man with nature. Dunlap and colleagues observe    a fundamental shift from a primarily technologically to a primarily ecologically    inspired social value pattern. In this view, environmentalist attitudes are    closely linked with other basic values: particularly religious orientations,    cosmopolitanism, technological views, and political attitudes. Again, similar    to Beck's argument, these represent the public's need to fundamentally restructure    society based on ecological principles. Extending this link among basic human    values, a number of American scientists, primarily psychologists, distinguished    a number of stable and coherent value clusters that correlate strongly with    environmental attitudes and behaviors (DIETZ et al. 1995; STERN &amp; DIETZ    1994; STERN, DIETZ &amp; GUAGNANO 1995, 1998; STERN, DIETZ, &amp; KALOF 1993;    STERN, DIETZ, KALOF, &amp; GUAGNANO 1995). These clusters are derived from a    values inventory defined by the social psychological value theorist Schwartz    (1992, 1994). <a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a> The clusters    range from homocentric concerns for the welfare of one's self and family to    holistic ecocentric perspectives in which human well-being is seen as inseparable    from that of the environment. A number of differently labeled value clusters    circulate, distinguishing among self-interest, concern for others, and concern    with the biosphere and were eventually termed egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric,    respectively. Stern's high-impact Schwartz adaptations are used primarily on    American data, independent of the work of Inglehart and colleagues. Thus we    can assert that there are at least two autonomous lines of environmental value    research: One centering on postmaterialism (Inglehart et al.) and the other    on value universals or basic values (Stern et al.).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Knowledge serves as an ambivalent factor in the relationship between values, concern, and behavior regarding environmental problems. Several studies indicate that public understanding of such environmental problems as global warming is poorly developed (Dunlap, 1998; Pierce &amp; LOVRICH, 1982). If the scope, causes, and consequences of environmental problems are poorly understood by the public, it may come as no surprise that there is both low awareness of these problems and minimal concern for their impact. Effects of scanty public knowledge are, however, not undisputed (SIM&Otilde;ES 2001), since correspondence between concern and knowledge is hard to interpret (BECKER et al. 1996, 19). Does knowledge generate concern, or does concern inspire the search for information? One might argue that information precedes the formation of attitudes and beliefs and is more directly related to values. Values, for instance, provoke people to seek information and may function as filters for information, influencing beliefs by making people accept information when consonant and reject information when dissonant with their values.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The subject of    beliefs also comes to the fore in the debate about the public's relationship    to environmental issues. Values are criteria remaining relatively stable over    the life course that guide action and underpin the development and maintenance    of attitudes toward relevant objects such as environmental problems (cf. Rokeach    1968). Beliefs, however, are expectations about how the attitude object, the    problem at hand, affects people and the things they value. Values are believed    to be closely knit with beliefs regarding consequences for the valued object,    and some analyses use products of values and beliefs only to predict behavioral    intentions (see STERN &amp; DIETZ, 1994). The distinction between attitudes    and beliefs (not to mention that between beliefs as specific cognitions about    consequences and knowledge) is unclear. In some lines of research, attitudes    coincide with environmental concern, while in others attitudes are judgments    of objects as functions of risks or benefits attached to those objects (STERN,    DIETZ &amp; GUAGNANO 1995, 1613). These risk perception attitudes clearly overlap    with beliefs defined as consequence judgments for valued objects. All in all,    the discussion presented here does not unequivocally suggest the existence of    an optimal theoretical or analytical model for looking at the relationship between    environmentally relevant values, beliefs, attitudes, information, and behaviors.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>REMAINING QUESTIONS    AND THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEY</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Three decades of scientific research into the environmental issue have generated many valuable insights, but perhaps even more unanswered questions. This section addresses these remaining questions. Indeed, providing an empirical answer to some of the following questions is the focal concern of the GOES project. Two types of questions have, until now, not been answered unequivocally. The first type of question deals with the mutual relationship between environmental values, between environmental attitudes, and between environmental behaviors. The second type of question focuses on an assessment of the impact these values and attitudes exert on behaviors.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly, the previous discussion indicates that the relationship between environmental values, attitudes, and behaviors remains open to debate. Two lines of value research have developed: the ascertainment of postmaterialist values (emerging primarily due to generational replacement), and the identification of a comprehensive inventory of human values (of which some are profoundly ecological). Both streams of value research are at odds as to the underlying principle on which environmental attitudes and behaviors are based. So far, little research has integrated both perspectives or addressed the question of the extent to which the two overlap or complement each other. First, the complex relationship between concern for the environment and information about environmental problems remains unclear. Next, the relationship among perceived behavioral control, concern for the human role in the environment, assessments of the most significant player in environmental issues, and attitudes toward environmental protection must still be clarified. Perceived self-efficacy, the idea that the individual can effect positive change in combating environmental problems, seems to play a major role in this relationship. However, the exact definition of this role within the context of other basic attitudes regarding individual impact in environmental protection and basic attitudinal controversies in the ecology-economy trade-off debate requires urgent clarification.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another intriguing area in environmental research is the importance of public willingness to act in the best interest of the environment, support for environmental policies that vary in individual cost and lifestyle adaptation, and effect of political orientation on the environment. The main issue at stake in this discussion is the ideological-political segmentation of pro-environmental positions. Finally, the concurrence of different behavior types among the public is highly indistinctive in environmental studies. Many separate studies deal either with "green" consumption, recycling and saving behavior, energy use, or travel behavior. An approach that integrates these behaviors and analyzes the overlap is scarce, and the search for a "green" consumer on all behavior types is a relatively recent challenge.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assessing the impact of all the previously mentioned factors on pro-environmental behaviors in the broad sense mentioned earlier, is another intriguing issue. Little is known about which of the two presented traditions of value research has the strongest impact on actual behavioral routines and policy preferences. The relationship between values and willingness to take political action has been previously investigated (especially as concerns postmaterialism). However, the association of values and more profane non-political behaviors, such as saving energy or water and traveling by automobile, have not been previously surveyed. Findings concerning the relationships of attitudes, behaviors, and policy priorities under the condition of values are also vague. Moreover, the combined impact of values and attitudes on behaviors and policy stances relative to influences of other key variables, such as social structural or contextual factors, calls for further exemplification. Finally, defining a space that delineates the social and cultural dimensions and is based on elaborate input about values, attitudes, and social characteristics of environmental behavior remains on the environmental research agenda.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Global Environmental    Survey (GOES), a large-scale international survey project aimed to analyze from    a comparative perspective values, attitudes, and behaviors affecting the environment,    endeavors to tackle the aforementioned questions.<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a>    It focuses especially on behaviors that exert a strong impact on energy consumption,    and accordingly on air pollution and climate change, as well as behaviors conditional    to change toward sustainable development. These behaviors, together with values    and attitudes, are measured among publics and elites in societies at various    stages of economic development. A terminal goal of the GOES project is to provide    input for models that forecast future energy consumptions. Thus, input consists    of data on the cultural factor&#151;the factor of shifts in values and attitudes    that are primary molders of public behavior and that may close the gap between    technical and social feasibility. Taking into account this cultural factor,    the culturally determined considerations of the public, is a prerequisite for    the public acceptability and subsequent success of policies. The key priority    of the Global Environmental Survey is to gain an understanding of the motives    underlying mass support for policies designed to solve environmental problems    and behaviors affecting global change.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THE GOES DECISION    MAKERS' MODULE</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One innovative    feature of the GOES project is that it deliberately moves beyond a mere cross-cultural    study of population-wide environmental values, attitudes, and behaviors, aiming    to compare the framing of environmental issues by national populations and by    leading national environmental decision makers and opinion leaders. In 1997    GOES participants decided to add a decision makers' module to the standard GOES    survey of national general public samples. The new module enables us to study    differences between environmental decision makers and general public attitudes    and policy preferences in the environmental policy arena. The module further    enables us to facilitate cross-national comparisons in this respect. The theoretical    rationale underlying this module is closely related to the issue of <u>political    representation</u><i>,</i> a classic topic in political science theory and research.    In one of the first studies in this field, McClosky, Hoffmann, and O'Hara (1960)    found that Democratic and Republican leaders were far more divided on salient    political issues than were their respective supporters, but that the level of    political consensus among the electorate was fairly high. In a study of Dutch    members of parliament (MPs) and voters, Thomassen (1976) found substantial political    dissensus between the elected and the electorate; moreover, dissensus between    party elite and voters was greatest among leftist parties. For most political    issues, contrasts were more prominent among MPs than among voters, and voters    were aware of these contrasts, albeit less aware than MPs realized. In a follow-up    study, Thomassen (1981a,b) again found that the electorate was less politically    polarized than MPs, and that generally MPs were more leftist than their voters.    Putnam (1976a) summarizes these differences in the phrase "elite mass displacement."    This phenomenon of systematic and marked differences in political attitudes    between the political elite and constituents has been widely confirmed, both    in national and local politics (VAN SCHENDELEN 1981; STROMBERG 1977; THOMASSEN    1986).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dekker and Ester (1988, 1989) hypothesized that attitudinal differences between politicians and voters may stem from insufficient or inaccurate knowledge among politicians of voters' political attitudes and policy preferences. They found politicians' knowledge of voter preference generally quite defective. Politicians' accuracy in estimating voter support for topical political attitudes is low, even with respect to a matter as simple as judging which party has more support. This may pose a crucial problem for environmental policy-making.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Are the phenomena    of elite mass displacement and cognitive responsiveness observable in the field    of environmental attitudes and policy preferences? Some evidence suggests that    this is indeed the case (cf. WORCESTER 1993; MERTIG &amp; DUNLAP 1993). A systematic    "global" contrast between how electoral masses and political elites evaluate    causes and solutions to environmental problems, as well as a systematic bias    in how political elites estimate environmental attitudes and preferences among    the general public, would seriously hamper the effectiveness of both national    and international environmental policies. Over- or underestimation of support    for environmental policies by environmental decision makers would constitute    a major constraint in implementing environmental strategies that correspond    with the public "will." In order for politicians to be effective in environmental    policy, they must accurately perceive how the public evaluates environmental    policy instruments, since public acceptability is a major prerequisite to policy    effectiveness. It seems, though, that political leaders are often poorly informed    about what issues, attitudes, and actions are supported by mass publics and    relevant elites. The rise of nuclear power plants is a historic illustration    of this conundrum. Hundreds of billions of dollars were spent to develop nuclear    power, with the use of advanced technology. However, in most societies nuclear    power was in the end politically unacceptable <u>because</u> of its social unacceptability.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Policies designed to solve environmental problems are unlikely to succeed unless they have broad political support. This in turn implies that decision makers responsible for environmental policy need an accurate understanding both of general public environmental attitudes and policy preferences and of broader social, political, economic, and cultural values affecting those attitudes and preferences. If decision makers lack this electorate connection, they face serious problems in convincing the public of the legitimacy of proposed environmental policies.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We believe it can thus be convincingly argued that a systematic (cross-national) analysis of environmental attitudes and policy preferences of both the general public and major decision makers, as well as decision makers' cognitive competence in estimating attitudes and preferences of the public at large, will generate crucial explanatory factors in understanding environmental policy acceptance. Though, of course, the political domain has its own relative autonomy and responsibility, and though politics is not merely a linear transformation and translation of public preferences, an accurate understanding of public preference is highly decisive in designing effective and socially acceptable environmental policies.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, in addition to the general national sample GOES study, GOES participants agreed upon an additional decision makers' module that addresses the following questions: Do environmental decision makers hold environmental attitudes and policy preferences that are distinct from the public at large? How accurate are environmental decision makers in estimating actual environmental attitudes and policy preferences among the public at large? Is there a systematic bias in environmental decision makers' estimates of environmental attitudes and environmental policy preferences of the general public? Are there systematic cross-national differences in this respect?</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A final rationale for inclusion in this module among high-ranking environmental decision makers relates not only to the cross-national nature of GOES but also to its transnational significance. In the last decade the international community has signed a number of international environmental treaties at various governmental meetings (such as Agenda 21, Rio de Janeiro Summit). The GOES participants agreed to investigate how leading national environmental decision makers evaluated a series of policies related to these treaties and how they evaluate their national policies to comply with these treaties. These evaluations provide us with exciting possibilities for analysis of compliance with internationally agreed environmental conventions from a global perspective. Thus, the final question to be answered by this module is this: How do decision makers value a number of policies that are direct implementations of international environmental treaties, and how do they judge their own national performance in this respect?</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These, then, are    the fundamental questions underlying the Decision Makers' Module&#151;in the    eyes of the GOES participants a highly original addition to the general public    survey. A systematic comparison between environmental attitudes and preferences    of the public at large and leading national decision makers not only enhances    the theoretical significance of the GOES project but also strengthens its international    policy relevance. It provides us with unique possibilities to study cross-nationally    the similarities and dissimilarities in environmental attitudes and policy preferences    between the general public and environmental policy makers. In this sense, the    GOES project moves beyond previous and existing environmental attitude research    projects.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>GOES COUNTRY    CHARACTERISTICS</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GOES Mass Public' Module conducted national probability surveys in Japan, the Netherlands and Germany; a probability survey in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil; and quota surveys in three regions of China; in Manila in the Philipines and in Bangkok in Thailand.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GOES Decision    Makers' Module conducted national surveys in Canada, in Japan and in the Netherlandas;    a survey in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil and in six regions of China.

The Netherlands is a small, highly modernized country, densely populated with 16 million inhabitants. The nation is very active in environmental policy-making, and in the international arena it endeavors to organize public support for its growth to sustainable development. Germany is also highly engaged in this type of environmental policy-making. It is much larger than the Netherlands, has a population of 80 million, and is a strong player in the global economy. Canada is also a highly modernized country, albeit relatively "empty." Its population of 31 million occupies an enormous land surface with a much richer spectrum of natural resources than the two European countries. The lack of natural resources is a central issue in Japan, a large, economically influential, and densely populated country (126 million) with serious pollution and waste problems. Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, and Japan are confronted with totally different environmental problems than large developing countries such as China (population 1.2 billion) and Brazil (174 million) or the smaller, but also densely populated developing countries of Thailand (61 million) and the Philippines (79 million). Deforestation, desertification, land erosion, and air and water pollution are, together with stagnated economic growth, serious problems in these countries (and their urban areas).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to    size, economic achievement, and current environmental issues, these countries    differ in basic cultural characteristics. The fundamental value distinctions    evident among Western, South American, and Asian countries are strongly related    to the political and religious histories of each country. The variance in basic    values coincides with a divergent pattern of religious traditions, political    customs, and civic cultures. Inglehart's cross-cultural study (1997) shows China    to be least and the Netherlands most postmaterialist (7 and 32 percent postmaterialist,    respectively); other nations fall somewhere between the Netherlands and China,    albeit closer to the former than the latter (INGLEHART, 1997: 359). The variable    interpersonal trust, a crucial variable related to civic culture, shows that    Brazil scores very low and China and the Netherlands very high in this area    (INGLEHART, 1997: 359; see also FUKUYAMA, 1995). Comparative data on national    cultures (with the exception of China), collected by Hofstede (1980, 1998, 2001),    indicate that the Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, and to a lesser extent Japan    differ from the West due to their strong emphasis on "power distance" (accepting    unequal distributions of power). The Japanese also rank high in "uncertainty    avoidance" (feeling threatened by uncertain situations), the Philippines and    Canada lowest. The Dutch and Canadians value "individualism" (taking responsibility    for one's own affairs) most highly. The lowest "individualism" scores are found    in Japan. Finally, "masculinity" (supporting assertive male roles and introverted    female roles) is found most frequently in Japan and least often in the Netherlands    (the Dutch are a factor 7 less "masculine").</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINDINGS FROM    THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL SURVEY<a name="top010"></a><a href="#back010"><sup>10</sup></a></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than presenting an exhaustive summary of the main findings of the GOES study, we choose to focus on a selective number of substantive issues that arise from our cross-cultural analyses. These issues are directly related to the very core of the GOES study: the way mass publics and decision makers frame environmental issues in general and sustainable development in particular, and the way environmental framing is rooted in basic social and cultural values. A stringent global sustainable development policy requires that not only national governments but also national publics are convinced of the necessity to redirect economic routes and lifestyles in consonance with the logic of sustainability, that is, finding the right balance between ecological, economic, and social parameters in which the legitimate needs of future generations have a recognizable place. The effectiveness of an emerging global sustainability policy depends not only on the willingness of national governments to ratify international environmental agreements but equally so on national publics' acceptance of effects on their lifestyles and consumption patterns. Implementing global environmental policies, in short, will succeed only when based on unequivocal public support, particularly when such policies require fundamental lifestyle changes. Realization of a sustainable global future will materialize only when the public, as part of the world community, agrees that societal goals embedded in sustainable policies are legitimate, just, efficient, and feasible.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From this perspective it is gratifying to conclude that in all countries of the GOES study, national publics have a clear sensitivity to the seriousness of environmental problems both at the national and international level. People in various continents clearly rank environmental degradation among their top societal concerns and are very aware of the necessity to take action. National sensitivity, of course, varies with the characteristics of the national environmental context. In the Netherlands people are particularly worried about air pollution, water pollution, and overpopulation, whereas in Germany industrial pollution and river pollution - and not overpopulation - are seen as severe environmental problems. Canadians, too, view air pollution as a most serious environmental issue in their country. For Brazilians, deforestation and water/sanitation issues constitute the most important environmental problems, reflecting the fact that Brazil contains about one-third of the tropical forests in the world and still faces a lacking urban infrastructure. In Japanese society industrial waste, air pollution, and toxic chemicals are seen as the most pressing environmental issues, a list of concerns, by the way, that does not include overpopulation. In China, though, overpopulation is a clear public concern together with air and water pollution.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It seems that especially in developing countries the rather abstract notion of "environment" is increasingly framed as a quality of life issue linked to classic social demands such as poor sanitation, polluted water, and inadequate housing. In this way major existential problems are "relabeled" as environmental issues. This may explain why in developing countries water pollution is seen by the public as the major environmental problem, whereas in developed countries the majority of the public cites air pollution. Thus, contextual national environmental data are indispensable in understanding national public environmental beliefs. But what about perceived seriousness of global environmental problems such as global warming, the loss of biodiversity, and the ozone hole? Such problems go beyond the "classic" environmental issues, such as air and water pollution or noise, and by nature are long-term and abstract issues transcending national boundaries. Though they are not nearly on the level of traditional environmental issues, a substantial segment of the population, particularly in developed countries, recognizes the urgency of these issues. The existential problems associated with daily life in developing countries apparently hamper the preoccupation with more global environmental concerns. A certain level of economic prosperity is likely required for a flourishing global environmental agenda shared by the public.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What people from developing and developed countries do share, though, is a widespread conviction that government should take the lead in protecting the environment through regulatory measures and a stringent surveillance policy. In the developing countries this conviction has been increasingly directed to the local government, while in developed countries it has been more focused on the national government. Despite neo-liberal market forces, the general publics from the various countries participating in GOES emphasize the primary responsibility of their respective governments in fighting environmental degradation. Across different countries, people desire a strong, directive role of government in designing, implementing, and controlling environmental policy that moves far away from a <u>laissez-faire</u> mentality. Prompting governmental leadership to protect the environment does not imply, as our findings show, that citizens deny a role of their own. Interestingly, as the country results indicate, significant segments of the various populations believe that the individual can make a difference in helping to conserve the environment. When contemplating environmental issues, citizens of the world do <u>not</u> describe their role with a generalized feeling of low self-efficacy, nor do they feel handicapped by an acute lack of environmental knowledge. Thus, the present debate on global sustainable development is not burdened by a massive <u>apr&egrave;s-moi-le-d&eacute;luge</u> climate of public opinion. Such self-efficacy can be read as a very positive sign since contemporary (global) environmental problems typically are beyond the control of the ordinary citizen, being complex, large-scale, multi-fold, often abstract, and beyond individual time horizons. But as we will see later it can also be a frustrating sign in that citizens may be verbally willing to do their share even in addressing global environmental issues but at the same time fail to comprehend the <u>causal</u> relationship between their behavior and the global issue at hand.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the very heart of the sustainability debate is the trade-off between environmental concerns and economic interests, for the sake not only of present but also of future generations. In some way or another, all major environmental disputes require governments, public and private advocacy and interest groups, and the public to weigh environmental and economic priorities. Although these priorities are not by definition contradictory, many environmental disputes often boil down to such a controversy. Faced with making this trade-off, the choice for the environment overrules that for economic interests among the populations of all countries surveyed in the GOES study. Citizens in both developed and developing countries prioritize environmental concerns over economic interests. This most remarkable finding clearly opposes many public beliefs about the beliefs of the public. It even opposes many political beliefs about the public environmental mood, as we will see shortly.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leaving aside the nuances reported in the country findings, the interim conclusion is that significant segments, if not majorities, of citizens are quite concerned about the state of the environment, particularly with respect to traditional environmental problems but less so regarding global issues. These citizens prompt government to take lead responsibility in improving the environment, at the same time affirming the role of the individual citizen, and take the side of the environment in the classic ecology-versus-economy controversy. But how do these environmentally "noble" attitudes and beliefs relate to citizens' willingness to accept environmental policy measures that affect their lifestyles, limit their freedom of consumption, put clear constraints on the private domain, and may increase the costs of living? Does environmental policy have noblesse oblige?</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There appears to be fair agreement among citizens from countries surveyed by the GOES study to favor "soft" over "hard" environmental policy measures. Instruments such as mass campaigns to educate citizens to use less energy, to cut back on driving, and to produce less household waste are preferred over policy measures such as raising taxes on fuel, rationing energy usage, or limiting car use. In promoting pro-environmental consumer behavior, citizens prefer persuasive and regulatory policy measures to market instruments. The more that environmental policy instruments limit personal freedom and choice, the less these instruments meet with public support. Harsh, top-down policies with severe lifestyle implications are clearly disapproved by the vast majority of citizens from all countries included in the GOES study. Apparently, citizens are not yet ready to translate pro-environmental concerns into acceptance of far-reaching environmental policy measures. Citizens in both developed and developing countries seem to prefer voluntary lifestyle changes.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moving from environmental concern via policy support to actual (reported) environmental behavior (a notoriously tricky issue in cross-national comparisons), we can conclude that persistent pro-environmental behavior does not describe citizens' environmental involvement and commitment. Our data indicate that environmentally relevant behaviors (e.g., transportation, energy use, recycling, household purchases, political activism) do not form a consistent and coherent pattern. Practice of one type of ecologically conscious behavior does not predict engagement in another. It is not that people reserve a distinctive spot in their mental software for judging the environmental impact of habitual behaviors. Their mental mapping probably consists of manifold decisional heuristics, including comfort, health, safety, price, efficiency, effectiveness, and social responsibility, which are likely to be hierarchically ordered and in competition with environmental heuristics. A focus on specific behaviors, though, reveals that citizens may be deeply involved in "green" behavior. In many developed countries recycling, for instance, has fairly reached the standard of habitual behavior, as the German and Dutch studies show. Recycling, practically a routine activity for the good citizen, is conveniently facilitated by a widely available infrastructure. Taking into account energy efficiency of household appliances and fuel efficiency of private cars has also become standard practice. It is noteworthy that in Germany respondents in the western states often report higher pro-environmental behavior and attitudes than those in eastern states. This is related in part to differences in opportunity structures, social situation and, arguably, cultural differences in exposure to green ideas. The policy lesson from this is not to prompt "general" environmentally friendly consumer behavior, but to promote single citizen actions having positive environmental impacts and, certainly, to create appropriate opportunity structures.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GOES project    is distinctive in the sense that it studies, cross-culturally, the influence    of basic social attitudes and human values on ecologically relevant behavior.    The assumption is that human behavior is goal-oriented, guided by attitudes    and values, and not merely the result of cognitive, rational mathematics unattached    to deeper motivations. But as we saw in the introductory section of this article,    the main question is whether human behavior is directly or more indirectly impacted    by attitudes and values. It seems that the latter interpretation stands our    empirical tests best. Attitudes and values do influence environmentally relevant    behavior, but mildly so, leaving significant portions of variance unexplained.    But then, of course, this is customary to most social survey analyses. In Brazil    we observed that postmaterialist values and socio-altruistic/biospheric values    are hardly related to pro-environmental behavior. In Germany, pro-environmental    attitudes and environmentally consciously behaviors show weak correlations.    Quite appropriately, our German colleagues' chapter in a book presenting the    full findings of both GOES Modules (ESRTER, VINKEN, SIM&Otilde;ES &amp; AYOAGI-USUI,    2003) is titled "Germans to the Green Front &#150; By Car, Naturally". In that    chapter, Molher and Harkness connect environmental behavior among Germans to    habitual behavior, regulations and legislation. They argue that habitual behavior    is habit reinforcing. In addition, the many pro-environmental regulations already    in place in Germany mean that a number of regularly occurring environmentally    friendly behaviors are mandatory, not optional. Disposal of domestic waste,    for example, is highly regulated. Different bins for different types of garbage    are compulsory. Collection costs for unsorted building waste are high, ensuring    that this, too, is either sorted or dumped illegally. Not to sort (and to dump)    is against the law. Thus those complying with regulations behave in a pro-environmental    fashion, independent of whether they have pro-environmental attitudes or intentions.    The reverse side of sorting also has economic appeal, as "garbage tourism" reflects:    Garbage or waste is sometimes dumped (wild dumping or cuckoo dumping) in order    to avoid paying for collection services. In Japan the influence of values on    pro-environmental behavior is likewise limited but self-efficacy has some impact.    In Japanese culture, Aoyagi-Usui argues in her GOES chapter, the norm of <i><u>mottainai</u></i>,    rather than environmental concern, appears to be the main normative factor involved    in environmentally friendly behavior. Japanese people have a <i><u>mottainai</u></i>    feeling for using things that would otherwise be wasted. <i><u>Mottainai</u></i>    is the urge to economize in order to avoid wasting something. It is related    to feelings of regret and shame, but is not motivated by concern for the environment.    When we asked respondents why they performed what we saw as pro-environmental    actions, they often replied "because it is <i><u>mottainai</u></i>". In the    Netherlands we found that environmental attitudes do not make a marked difference    in explaining pro-environmental behavior, but such value orientations as postmaterialism    and biospheric commitments, self-efficacy, and prioritization of ecological    concerns over economic interests have some impact. These findings leave us with    the conclusion that environmentally relevant behavior is at best indirectly    affected by basic human values and social attitudes. We know that environmental    concern is widely diffused in both developed and developing countries, though    framed in different terms, but apparently it loses its impact when competing    with other prime concerns in major consumption decisions. Moreover, the more    universally basic values are formulated, the less disagreement they will meet    and consequently the less variance is left as an explanatory factor. This is    exactly the phenomenon we observed in the various country studies. Assuming    a causal relationship between basic values related to man-nature interaction    and environmental behavior is not a strong case. Is the study of values and    environmental engagement therefore obsolete? Certainly not. We must simply look    more closely at the specific values that relate to the core of consumer behavior    and are less distant than abstract "universal" values regarding man-nature relationships.    As indicated earlier, these values underlie the mental software that consumers    apply in making decisions. Proximate values such as those related to comfort,    health, safety, efficiency, goal-attainment, social distinction, and responsibility    are more likely to impact pro-environmental consumer behavior than are "distant"    values involving the relationship between man and nature. Future comparative    research should wisely concentrate on whether the hierarchy of proximate values    in consumers' environmental behavior does indeed make the difference and, if    so, whether this hierarchy is cross-culturally stable.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A unique feature of the GOES project is the simultaneous cross-national study of environmental beliefs of both general publics and environmental decision makers. One assumption of this combined perspective is that sustainable policy advancement will succeed only if environmental decision makers correctly understand the public's environmental beliefs and policy preferences. Under- or overestimation of public's environmental concern and support for environmental policy measures will seriously hamper policymakers in choosing the optimal mix of policy instruments that meets with public understanding and support. Of course the political domain has an autonomy and responsibility of its own, but misjudging the public "will" evokes reactance effects that negatively affects policy acceptance. We found some remarkable and systematic cross-national biases in decision makers' competence of estimating the general public's environmental beliefs and policy support.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These biases, interestingly, are related to issues at the core of the sustainability debate. We observed in the GOES Mass Public Survey that in all countries included, citizens both in developed and developing countries prioritize ecological concerns over economic interests. In our parallel survey of decision makers we found that they, though, have a markedly different estimate, wrongly predicting that citizens en masse choose economic growth in this basic trade-off. Thus, decision makers clearly underestimate public readiness to support ecological stakes in balancing environmental and economic interests. Likewise, they underestimate public willingness to take individual responsibility in fighting environmental deterioration. Moreover, their assessment of public knowledge of environmental "global" problems is much more negative then the public's self-evaluation in this respect. This inaccuracy in understanding the public's "green profile" as found in the Netherlands, Japan, and Brazil&#151;very different societies in terms of culture, politics, development, and environmental features&#151;is troublesome as these issues do not relate to marginal matters but touch the very nucleus of the present discourse on sustainable development. It seems as if the average decision-maker has a stereotyped, somewhat skeptical, image of the environmental stands of the general public: The public is generally not well informed about environmental issues (particularly not on global problems) prefers economic interests over ecological concerns, is not really committed to environmental values, and is unwilling to accept environmental policy measures that may negatively impact its lifestyle. In this sense, stereotyped beliefs about the public's environmental attitudes and behavior seem almost culturally invariant. The story is even worse than stereotyped beliefs. Many decision makers' expressions of these beliefs were hardly free of a cynical undertone. Such an attitude, of course, is detrimental to environmental decision makers' policy choices made to change the public mind. Cynicism is an ill advisor in designing policies that aim to prompt pro-environmental citizen behavior, since citizens will accept only policies they perceive as just and legitimate combined with high trust in policymakers themselves. Particularly when faced with complex, abstract, and long-term global problems, emancipated citizens demand transparent explanations, free of skepticism, of how these problems are related to consumer lifestyles and macro-economic choices. The path towards a sustainable society requires a milieu of environmental policymakers that can forcefully, convincingly, and faithfully plea for lifestyle changes. Besides, populations in developed countries are highly educated and will simply challenge ambivalent sustainable policy explanations by decision makers. The irony, or maybe tragedy, is that substantial segments of the population share decision makers' concerns about the seriousness of global environmental problems, and by questioning the sincerity or "depth" of the public's environmental views, decision makers may clearly miss the point. Public support for their concerns is greater than decision makers themselves perceive. As such, underestimating public support is simply a missed opportunity.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But fortunately there is also a more positive side to the way decision makers view the world in general and man-nature relationships in particular. In all countries that conducted the GOES Decision makers' Survey it was observed that leading national environmental policymakers and opinion leaders are consistently more supportive of postmaterialist values than is the general public. Since postmaterialism is positively correlated with pro-environmentalism (Inglehart 1995; Inglehart &amp; Rabi&eacute;r 1986), the implication is that the various actors in the national environmental arenas share an above-average interest in ecological concerns even when representing social and economic domains where this is less 'usance'. Broad interest clearly is an advantage when designing sustainable policies that require consensual democratic input.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It seems, on balance,    that environmental decision makers must do a better job. They are intensively    engaged in negotiating international treaties on global problems and flying    from one conference to another, to the best of their diplomatic skills. When    "results" are recorded, such as at the 1997 Kyoto conference or at the 2001    Bonn aftermath conference, the international environmental diplomatic world    sighs from relief, and rightfully so. For the interested average citizen, however,    these treaties are a beginning and not an end. The emancipated citizen wants    to know what it means for his or her lifestyle if it is agreed that the nation's    carbon emissions must be reduced by, say, 15 percent in ten years. Here is where    environmental policy comes in&#151;not "only" by designing implementation policies    but also by explaining the logic of emission reduction, the rationality of choices,    and the calculus of expectations <u>vis-&agrave;-vis</u> consumer lifestyle    changes. Somehow the "grand" environmental policy narratives of decision makers    should be linked to the "petite" everyday narratives and struggles of the ordinary    citizen. It appears that a level discrepancy exists between the environmental    policy agenda and the public's agenda. Environmental policymakers increasingly    frame environmental problems as global and complex issues, whereas the individual    consumer struggles to assess the relevance of such framing for everyday life    considerations (Ester and Vinken 2000). It seems, in conclusion, that environmental    decision makers at the start of the 21st century must re-invest in their dialogue    with the citizen: by explaining policy goals, by explicating and facilitating    consumer behavior changes, and by giving feedback on policy results. Dialogue,    explanation, explication, facilitation, and feedback are the crucial factors    for sustainable policy to be successful and acceptable.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cross-cultural    GOES project has provided us with unique cross-national insights in how mass    publics and decision makers in both developed and developing countries frame    environmental problems and solutions. In addition, the project has shown how    leading environmental decision makers and opinion leaders assess the environmental    beliefs and attitudes of the public. In order to further advance the academic    and policy significance of this study, it seems important to not only repeat    the study periodically but also to expand the number of countries and cultures    involved. A larger number of countries varying in highly relevant features such    as economic development, physical and geographical condition, socio-political    constellation, environmental policy magnitude, and environmental leadership,    would surely enhance our understanding of factors affecting sustainable development.    There is also an intrinsic cross-cultural legitimation to such a broadening.    The way world citizens and environmental decision makers frame environmental    problems and solutions is definitely rooted in different cultural assumptions    on man-nature relationships, in different cultural traditions of environmental    stewardship, and in different cultural perceptions of the environmental heritage.    The salience of the cultural factor in cross-national environmental research    is here to stay and merits a dominant position on both the research and policy    agenda.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>REFERENCES</b></font></p>      <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AJZEN, I., &amp;    M.

See SIM&Otilde;ES (2001) for a detailed analysis of the state-of-the-art contribution    of survey research to the description and explanation of environmental concern.    <br>   <a name="back02"></a><a href="#top2">2</a>. One could provide different sets    of examples. Major risks in the Netherlands, as well as other postindustrial    countries, are connected to the distribution of risks in the domains of labor,    social security, (health) care, and leisure due to the "graying" of society&#151;risks    that will put severe pressure on future generations (see for more details ESTER    &amp; VINKEN, 2000).    <br>   <a name="back03"></a><a href="#top3">3</a>. INGLEHART combines Maslowian theory    of the human need hierarchy, Mannheimian theory of generational socialization,    Rokeach's value theory, and economic scarcity theories. See also Chapter 4.    <br>   <a name="back4"></a><a href="#top4">4</a>. See VAN DEN BROEK (1996) for an extensive    report on the value effects of generational replacement in the Netherlands.    <br>   <a name="back5"></a><a href="#top5">5</a>. Use is made of data from the so-called    Health of the Planet Survey conducted in 24 countries that strongly vary in    economic development rates (DUNLAP, GALLUP &amp; GALLUP, 1993a).    <br>   <a name="back6"></a><a href="#top6">6</a>. The New Ecological Paradigm made    history as an environmental attitude measurement scale and is now one of the    most widely used measures tapping negative consequences of human interactions    with the environment (cf. STERN, DIETZ &amp; GUAGNANO, 1995; STERN, DIETZ, KALOF    &amp; GUAGNANO, 1995).    <br>   <a name="back7"></a><a href="#top7">7</a>. SCHWARTZ analyzed 44 countries' value    positions to define these clusters. The value inventory of Schwartz, containing    dozens of terminal and instrumental values, was originally developed by ROKEACH    (1973) and has encountered many other extensions. One of the more serious competitors    of the Schwartz cluster definition and analyses of country differences based    on the Rockeach inventory is HOFSTEDE (1980), who identified several dimensions    (including femininity/masculinity, individualization, power distance, and risk    avoidance) on which countries strongly diverge.    <br>   <a name="back8"></a><a href="#top8">8</a>. See for details about objectives,    organization, design, data, and results of the Global Environmental Survey our    Web site: <a href="http://www.nies.go.jp/shakai/goes/index.htm" target="_blank">http//www.nies.go.jp/shakai/goes/index.htm</a>.    <br>   <a name="back9"></a><a href="#top9">9</a>.

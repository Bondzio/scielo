Abstract The representation of Brazilian women in Portugal shows them as easygoing, victims of post-colonial and patriarchal domination. The emergence of a kind of gymnastic called &#8220;Made in Brazil&#8221;, that promises to unveil the &#8220;secret of the Brazilian woman&#8221; led us to investigate it. Through interviews and participant observation, we sought to understand the subjectification process of these brazilian women through their bodies. Beyond the hipersexualization, the interviewees understood the qualities for which they are identified and identify themselves as a negotiation path in search for prestige.

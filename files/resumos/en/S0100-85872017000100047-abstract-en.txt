Abstract The aim of the article isto analyze the negotiations between beliefs and sexuality through the biographical recounts of two women who have sex-affective relations with other women and identify themselves as Christian. Since religious institutions in Latin America play an important role in prescribing the ways of living sexuality within the familiar, heteronormative and reproductive norm; we are interested in approaching the universe of meanings in which modes of believe and live the sexuality are stressed and negotiated. Through the native category of &#8220;Scattered Christian&#8221; the article will reflect on the control of sexuality in religious and family spaces.

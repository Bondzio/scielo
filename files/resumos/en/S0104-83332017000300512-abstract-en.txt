Abstract Connecting social and aesthetic dramas, the June quadrilhas perform the resolution of a social drama about paternity assignment. A marriage emerges as reparative action of established drama, inserting women and men in a system of kinship relations. However, in Belém&#8217;s (Pará) quadrilha contests there is a significant participation of homosexuals, travestis, transsexuals and transgenders, destabilizing, on the aesthetic level, the binary choreographic division between damas (ladies) and cavalheiros (gentlemen), and, at the symbolic/social level, traditional conceptions of heterosexual conjugality.

AbstractThis article is an attempt to draw the parallels between the way in which the Afrikaner ideology, supported by the British group, gained strength in the South African political scene - from the legal system of segregation to the racism instituted system of apartheid - and caused direct influences on daily life of the non-white South-Africans, directly affecting cosmological elements that mobilize their day-to-day. From the violence that has organized various removals in the countryside, the effects of theapartheid caused disagreements with the ancestors that people have to deal to the present day, in a movement that seeks to come to terms with the past.

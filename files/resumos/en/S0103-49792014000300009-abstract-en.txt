The article analyzes some social protests that have appeared around the world from 2008, especially in Egypt, Spain, USA, Chile and Brazil. Our interest is in the impact, on these events, of the use of social networks, already fairly inserted in a context of intense mediation in communication between protesters and public opinion in general. We analyze two aspects: the impact on the organization of these movements and more central use of images as a form of communication. With a view to identify new points, more than deeply analyze them, indicate that there are interesting possibilities for counter-hegemonic struggle from the extensive and intensive use of social media, which is given by the search for radical democracy and critical use of images.

Abstract In this paper, I pretend to analyze how insecurity has emerged as a public problem in a peripheral neighborhood of Buenos Aires. While academic researches usually emphasize the role of media in the construction of insecurity and the specific features of victims recognized as legitimate, here I am interested in exploring the collective work of being included in the canon (and challenge its limits). In order to achieve my goals, I will focus on the collective articulation of three languages of mobilization: one linked to the image of the victim, another one inherited from popular protests and a third one connected to current technological devices.

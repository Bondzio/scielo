The lack of competitiveness of Brazilian cassava starch industry in relation to corn starch is explained by the difficulty to obtain raw material (cassava roots) in stable quantities and stable prices. The resolution of these problems involves the adoption of governance systems that stabilize the transactions between producers and processing units. The analysis of 37 factories has allowed the evaluation of transaction costs and the performance of adopted governance systems, calculated from the ability to stabilize raw material supply. The governance systems were classified into six groups, from spot market to vertical integration, depending on the level of warranty offered in the delivery of raw material. Despite the identification of asset specificity and transaction risk, cassava starch companies prefer market transaction, a governance system identified as less efficient. The low efficiency of institutions increase transaction costs of contractual governances, which can explain the preference for the market. Contractual agreements with intermediaries and strong warranties are more efficient, but with high transaction costs. These results indicate two ways to improve the competitiveness of the cassava starch industry: (1) improvement in market efficiency, system with lower transaction costs, (2) reduction of transaction costs for governance systems with more warranties, which might generates more efficient systems. While neither of the two solutions is adopted, Brazilian cassava starch industry continues to adopt low transaction costs, but with weak efficiency.

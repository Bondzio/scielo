ABSTRACT This text approaches matters related to the specificity of the knowledge produced by human sciences and, consequently, the implications of this knowledge for the researcher&#8217;s work. In order to do that, we will count on the invaluable contributions of Bakhtin and Wittgenstein, two philosophers of language. The novelty of their thinking lies in the attempt to free human sciences from a single model of rigor concerning scientific methodology and, moreover, in the bold invitation to the researcher, from whom singularity and responsibility in the act of thinking is expected.

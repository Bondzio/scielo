Although the basic features of    the Xavante secular age-group system were previously described, a second age-group    system in the spiritual domain is presented here for the first time. In this    paper, I describe the Xavante spiritual life cycle, including a structural dynamic    whereby age sets pass through age grades in alternate fashion, allocating them    between two moieties. That basic morphology is shared with the secular age-group    system and attests to a Xavante logic of hierarchy and symmetry as mutually    constructed and non-contradictory. Interactions between the spiritual and secular    age-group systems manifest in the daily experience of spiritual participants    in ways that suggest plurality and contingency are essential features of Xavante    social organization.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords:</b>    age-group systems, Brazil, social organization, Xavante.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A sociedade Xavante,    bem conhecida na literatura antropol&oacute;gica pelo car&aacute;ter dualista    de sua estrutura social, constitui um dos exemplos melhor documentados de um    sistema organizacional com base em grupos de idade na Am&eacute;rica do Sul.    Apesar de as caracter&iacute;sticas fundamentais do sistema secular de grupos    de idade Xavante terem sido descritas anteriormente, um segundo sistema de grupo    de idade, de natureza espiritual, &eacute; aqui apresentado pela primeira vez.    Neste artigo descrevo o ciclo espiritual Xavante, incluindo a din&acirc;mica    por meio da qual as classes de idade passam, de maneira alternada, atrav&eacute;s    de categorias de idade, alocando-os entre as duas metades. Essa morfologia b&aacute;sica    &eacute; compartilhada com o sistema secular de grupos de idade e atesta a exist&ecirc;ncia    de uma l&oacute;gica hier&aacute;rquica e sim&eacute;trica mutuamente constru&iacute;da    e compat&iacute;vel entre si. As intera&ccedil;&otilde;es entre os sistemas    espiritual e secular de grupos de idade manifestam-se na experi&ecirc;ncia cotidiana    dos participantes espirituais, revelando o car&aacute;ter plural e condicional    da organiza&ccedil;&atilde;o social Xavante.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palavras-chave:</b>    Brasil, organiza&ccedil;&atilde;o social, sistemas de grupos de idade, Xavante.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Xavante society,    like other G&ecirc;-speaking societies, is well-known for its dual structural    aspects. Through the influential work of anthropologist David Maybury-Lewis    (1967, 1979), political factionalism, characterized by a fundamental ideological    bifurcation of society between people considered proximate and distant, came    to be recognized as a primary feature of the social system. Also through his    work, the Xavante came to be amply recognized as a South American example of    an indigenous society with a formal age-group system, alternatively known as    an age-set system or age-class system. These systems, which up to that time    were better known from Africa, are characterized by age sets (cohorts or classes)    that pass through a series of formal age grades (ranks) by means of public ceremonial    events or rites of passage (Bernardi, 1985; Prins, 1953; Stewart, 1977). Formal    age grades in these relatively uncommon systems differ from the informal age    grades that are present in all societies and mark stages of the human life cycle    based on individualistic and subjective criteria. Evidence of age-group systems    in G&ecirc; societies was first mentioned for the Canela and Xerente (Lowie,    1939, 1946; Nimuendaju, 1942, 1946; Nimuendaju; Lowie, 1937, 1938).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One aspect of the    Xavante age-group system makes it particularly interesting for discussions regarding    the place of dual social morphologies in G&ecirc; societies, a topic that has    received considerable scholarly attention (e.g., Bamberger, 1974; Carneiro da    Cunha, 1982; DaMatta, 1983; Lave, 1975; L&eacute;vi-Strauss, 1944). In addition    to the conjunction of age sets and formal age grades that comprise the age-group    system, the age sets are allocated in alternation between two age-set moieties.    The basic features of this system were first reported by Maybury-Lewis (1967)    and I undertook its reevaluation in my doctoral dissertation (Welch, 2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this system,    throughout a lifetime, male and female members of age sets pass through a series    of formal age grades, which entails pre-initiation (<i>wapt&eacute;</i>),<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a>    novitiate adulthood (<i>ritei'wa</i>), and mature adulthood (<i>ipr&eacute;du</i>).    Promotion between age grades occurs collectively, as an age set, according to    a public ritual calendar involving initiation rites (<i>danhono</i>) that occur    about every five years. At the conclusion of these rites, a new age set is inaugurated    and parents assign to it their young sons and daughters of roughly similar ages.    For boys, age-set membership entails residing away from their natal households    in a pre-initiate house. For girls, age-set membership does not stipulate a    change of residence. Each age set bears a name from a pre-determined sequence    of eight, such that about every forty years each age-set name is recycled. In    the Pimentel Barbosa/Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute; community, where I did my fieldwork,<a name="top2"></a><sup><a href="#back2">2</a>,<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3">3</a></sup>    the sequence of age-set names is <i>tirowa</i>, <i>&ecirc;t&frac12;p&aacute;</i>,    <i>airere</i>, <i>h&ouml;t&ouml;r&atilde;</i>, <i>anharowa</i>, <i>sada'ro</i>,    <i>abare'u</i>, and <i>noz&ouml;'u</i>.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>    Consequently there is a need to distinguish between senior and junior age sets    that carry the same name. That is accomplished by appending the suffix -<i>'rada</i>    ("first" or "old") to the elder of two groups bearing the same name. As these    age-set names are applied in turn, they are also allocated in alternation between    two unnamed age-set moieties that are associated with the alternating location    of the pre-initiate boys' house on opposite sides of the village. Thus, the    four age sets inaugurated into the pre-initiate house on one side are, in perpetual    sequence, <i>tirowa</i>, <i>airere</i>, <i>anharowa</i>, and <i>abare'u</i>.    The four age sets that cycle on the other side are, in turn, <i>&ecirc;t&frac12;p&aacute;</i>,    <i>h&ouml;t&ouml;r&atilde;</i>, <i>sada'ro</i>, and <i>noz&ouml;'u</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Essential to this    division into age-set moieties is a social morality of sidedness in how their    members relate to one another in certain contexts. It stems from a privileged    relationship between members of alternate age sets, which are adjacent age sets    within the same age-set moiety. Members of the older of these two age sets serve    as mentors (<i>danhohui'wa</i>) to members of the younger, who are their prot&eacute;g&eacute;s    (<i>h&ouml;'wa n&otilde;ri</i>). The relationship between them is characterized    by a profound sense of allegiance involving indulgence and mutual trust. These    relationships last a lifetime, such that every second group of pre-initiate    coresidents joins a chain of mentors and prot&eacute;g&eacute;s connected through    intimate bonds of friendship and respect. Thus, all members of an age-set moiety    share a deep sense of loyalty. They form a single group of mutual interest and    concern, keeping one another's secrets from members of the other moiety. They    are all on the same side and designate each other "our age-set side" or "people    on our age-set side" (<i>waza'runiw)mh&atilde;</i>). In contrast, members of    the other age-set moiety are their rivals and disconfidants. Members of the    each moiety call the rival moiety "the other age-set side" or "people on the    other age-set side" (<i>h&ouml;'amoniw)mh&atilde;</i>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scholars of Xavante    social organization after Maybury-Lewis also mention another age-graded system    in the domain of male spiritual life (Giaccaria; Heide, 1984; M&uuml;ller, 1976;    Welch, 2009). According to those accounts, males are introduced to the spiritual    system during an initiation ritual (<i>darini</i>), which occurs about every    15 years, and subsequently pass through a sequence of four spiritual grades    over the course of a lifetime. Different from descriptions by other scholars,    my data indicate that this spiritual system also involves age sets according    to a pattern of alternation, whereby successive spiritual age sets are allocated    into two age-set moieties. It thus constitutes a formal age-group system, making    the Xavante an exceptional case of a society with two independently operating    formal age-group systems. This spiritual system marks social age in an analogous    manner to the secular system, although in a categorically different domain of    social relations. This finding deserves special note because it suggests that    the pattern of moieties generated through alternation of age sets, previously    documented only in the secular age-group system, is a characteristically Xavante    social morphology in multiple fields of social relations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of    this paper is to present the spiritual life cycle and discuss its relationship    to other dimensions of Xavante social organization. In the first section, I    describe the spiritual hierarchy, presenting evidence that it constitutes a    formal age-group system. In the second section, I argue that Xavante society    entails a logic of hierarchy and symmetry as mutually constructed and non-contradictory.    In the third section, I discuss interactions between the spiritual and secular    age-group systems in order to demonstrate that plurality and contingency are    essential features of Xavante social organization. In the conclusion, I draw    on scholarship regarding other G&ecirc;-speaking societies to suggest that the    plurality and non-opposition of hierarchical and symmetrical social morphologies    is not unique to the Xavante.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I base my arguments    on both social <i>structure</i> and social <i>practice</i>.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>    This approach derives principally from my field experience with the Xavante    at Pimentel Barbosa/Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute;, in which I encountered "social    structure" to be so overt and tangible, expressed abundantly in everyday speech    and action, that I could not escape considering it to be a relevant factor in    social reality. In the more informal moments of life, I found there to be rich    expression of some of the more nuanced aspects of social life at the interface    between structure and practice. For the Xavante, age hierarchies, in particular,    are not abstractions; they are conspicuously part of how people see and interact    with each other.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The spiritual    age-group system</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a researcher    at Pimentel Barbosa/Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute;, I was incorporated into the social    system as a male member of a specific secular age set (<i>&ecirc;t&frac12;p&aacute;</i>),    which then occupied the novitiate adult age grade (<i>ritei'wa</i>), and as    a member of the initiate spiritual age grade (<i>wai'&atilde;ra</i>). Much of    my social interaction with the community was flavored by the collateral effects    of assuming those social statuses. Consequently, those social bearings also    inform this paper because my reading of Xavante social organization was affected    by my particular position within it. When I visit the village, I am encouraged    to participate in spiritual rituals (<i>wai'a</i>), not only to improve my understanding    of Xavante society, but also because that is what is expected of me as a man.    I participated in one spiritual ritual during my first visit to the field, and    then many more times over the six years I have worked with the Xavante. On numerous    occasions, including the ritual during my first visit, I was selected for the    grueling task of carrying sacred cane arrows (<i>ti'ip&ecirc;</i>) while dancing    and singing from late afternoon until after sunrise the following day. I cannot    say I enjoyed those long nights, but through them I came to appreciate in a    personal manner the camaraderie and solidarity that exists between age peers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A form of these    spiritual rituals that was commonly performed during my fieldwork begins in    a forest clearing between the village and nearby river. Some participants arrive    in the early morning, before sunrise, while others arrive in the early afternoon.    Women are not allowed in this clearing, even though the activities that occur    there are not, strictly speaking, considered secret.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a>    Women do not witness what occurs there, but they may hear about it afterwards.    The men spend a number of hours in the clearing, during which spiritual singers    (<i>z&ouml;'ra'si'wa</i>) maintain a mesmerizing pulse of song while sitting    in a circle at the center of the clearing. Meanwhile, spiritual initiates (<i>wai'&atilde;ra</i>)    stand around the upper half of the clearing and spiritual guards (<i>dama'ai'a'wa</i>)    make repeated passes in front of them, in which they swing their arms in stylized    shows of aggression and sometimes stomp forcefully on initiates' feet. All the    while, spiritual post-officiants (<i>wai'a'rada</i>) sit at the far periphery    of the clearing talking amongst themselves and gleefully heckling the participants.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Subsequently, the    entire contingent of male spiritual participants and elders return to the village.    There, a select set of about six to eight initiates, each carrying a sacred    cane arrow (<i>ti'ip&ecirc;</i>) fletched with avian down and laced with poison    pigments, run from the center of the plaza to a separate location in the forest,    where secret activities are held away from eyes and ears of women and uninitiated    males. Meanwhile, the other initiates, guards, and singers continue singing    in a wide arc as they pass in front of the houses that face the plaza. As the    sun begins to descend and the first round of public singing is complete, initiates    return to their houses, where they collect food items prepared by their mothers,    aunts and grandmothers, and deliver them to the guards in the center of the    plaza. The guards retrieve these corn loafs, cooked wild tubers, bottles of    soda, and other treats, from two communal piles and, sharing them with their    elders, consume them amidst animated conversation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The singing continues    throughout the night, which often can be quite cold in the region of the Serra    do Roncador, Mato Grosso. However, not everyone remains. Singers, guards, and    post-officiants often retire to their homes to enjoy full nights of sleep. Even    the majority of initiates go home, as they wish, to rest up for the continuation    of the ritual the following morning. The only individuals required to remain    are the six to eight initiates selected to carry the sacred arrows and sing    throughout the night, which is a most difficult task during the early morning    hours.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although only those    few initiates are obliged to remain all night, they are rarely left completely    alone. There are usually several guards about to make sure they maintain the    rhythm of their song, continue the seemingly endless rounds around the village    with only minimal time to rest, and stay away from such comforts as coffee or    a warming fire that burns in the middle of the plaza. Also often present are    a few diehard post-officiants, who remain near the fire in the throes of happy    nighttime conversations, and occasionally initiates who were not chosen to carry    sacred arrows but wish to offer support to their age mates. At times, when the    strains of cold and lack of sleep cause the initiates to drop the rhythm or    sonority of their song, someone wrests himself from sleep, returning to the    plaza to help them recuperate the performance. Eerie sounds, which only occur    on occasions of spiritual rituals, sometimes emanate from the forest near the    village and suggest the veiled presence of other entities in the vicinity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the first detectible    signs of morning light, the small circle of initiates is gradually rejoined    by the men who slept during the night. One-by-one, initiates, guards, and singers    step back in and add their voices to the tired songs of those initiates who    did not have the luxury of sleep. Once the sun is up, singing is concluded and    the sacred cane arrows are retrieved from the select initiates who cared for    them throughout the night. Often, in the cold early morning, arrow competitions    mark the end of the ritual. In these, guards in hiding behind the ring of houses    shoot special ceremonial arrows in tall arches into the village plaza. These    arrows are longer from hardwood tip to bamboo base than an adult man is tall    and sport showy feather fletching, interspersed with strips of snake skin, and    two tufts of hair at the base. Initiates rush to grab them from the air before    hitting the ground, a dangerous activity but one that carries the reward of    a gratifying public cheer. Then, once again, initiates return home to fetch    food items for their elders.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The difficult task    of carrying sacred arrows while singing all night is only assigned to senior    members of the initiate age grade (<i>wai'&atilde;ra ipredumrini</i>). This    is because it is considered as somber a responsibility as it is a challenging    one because it must be carried out to completion without fail. Staving off sleep,    enduring the cold, maintaining vocal syntax and cadence, and carrying sacred    cane arrows (<i>ti'ip&ecirc;</i>) throughout the entire night require extreme    force of will. It is a grueling chore bemoaned by most initiates. Yet, performing    that chore is an essential part of their spiritual training. It is a test of    their resilience, a means of acquiring spiritual strength, and a prerequisite    to advancing to the grade of spiritual guards.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The stark differences    between the ceremonial roles of initiates, guards, singers, and post-officiants,    described above, are evidence of a highly formalized system of age grades that    informs all aspects of Xavante spirituality. External to that system is the    category of boys who have not yet been ritually initiated into the spiritual    system. They are considered spiritual pre-initiates (<i>wautop'tu</i>). In my    experience, spiritual pre-initiates do not in any way participate in spiritual    rituals, except as spectators, when allowed. I do not consider spiritual pre-initiation    to be a formal spiritual grade because it denotes those individuals who are    excluded from the spiritual system. However, that distinction is arbitrary.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Spiritual initiates    (<i>wai'&atilde;ra</i>) are those young males who were initiated during the    most recent 15-yearly initiation rites and are the youngest participants in    spiritual ceremonies. Spiritual initiates are expected to attend spiritual rituals    on a regular basis in order to improve their stamina as a condition for spiritual    receptivity. Although spiritual rituals may be held for numerous reasons and    follow several different formats, just one of which was described above, they    all include an element of regimentation for initiates, including dietary restrictions    with public chastisement for transgressions and ceremonial responsibility for    singing for extended periods under physical stresses, such as lack of sleep    and extreme temperatures.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next spiritual    grade in ascending order is that of "guards" or "soldiers" (<i>dama'ai'a'wa</i>),    those translations being the ones typically used by the Xavante (<i>guardas</i>    and <i>soldados</i>, in Portuguese), are who are promoted from the initiate    grade in the same 15-yearly rites that marks the entrance of initiates into    the system. In the context of spiritual rituals, guards watch over the initiates    as enforcers. They punish dietary transgressions and maintain a presence during    spiritual rituals to ensure that initiates carry out their duties without indulging    in sleep, drinking coffee or alcohol, or seeking heat during the coldest hours    of the night. Indicative of their authority over initiates are bows and arrows    that they carry and not infrequently use with jabbing motions against misbehaving    initiates. Thus, guards, consistent with the militaristic nomenclature of their    status, assume an overtly antagonistic stance towards initiates but arguably    do so to encourage their spiritual betterment. Like initiates, guards are not    responsible for conducting the spiritual ceremonies per se, but direct certain    aspects, including those that specifically have to do with maintaining vigilance    over initiate behavior.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actively conducting    the spiritual ceremonies are "singers" (<i>z&ouml;'ra'si'wa</i>). No longer    responsible for presiding antagonistically over initiates, singers do the core    work of officiating spiritual rituals. For several hours from early dawn before    each spiritual ritual, singers gather in a small clearing between the village    and the river. Already painted, adorned, and with palpably focused states of    mind, they greet the early morning light sitting in a small circle, often around    a smoldering fire. At their backs, planted in the ground, stand sturdy ceremonial    clubs, from which are suspended small bundles of personal items. They shake    rattles vigorously, incessantly, while untiringly repeating a song that was    unveiled for this one and only occasion. Despite the impressive visual and auditory    potency of their performances, it would seem that the primary work of singers    is introspective. They resume that work later in the afternoon and continue    it as the entire progression of guards threateningly dances past the line of    initiates, who outstretch their feet so the guards might stomp on them as punishment    for eventual dietary transgressions. Later in the afternoon and again the next    morning, back in the village, the singers lead members of the younger spiritual    grades in singing around the village, reinvigorating tired initiates and guards    with their determined and authoritative bearings.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most senior    spiritual grade is that of post-officiants or elders (<i>wai'a'rada</i>), who    were initiated into the spiritual system prior to the third most recent spiritual    initiation rites. Having already served as initiates, guards, and singers, post-officiants    have no formal role to play in spiritual rituals. Their attendance is optional    and their participation often limited to the sidelines. They are considered    something like spiritual retirees, having left that work in the hands of well-prepared    younger individuals. Yet, post-officiants are not superfluous to spiritual endeavors.    Besides watching spiritual rituals, they often help in their organization and    may, should they choose, speak up to counsel or give advice to participants.    Also, although post-officiants watch spiritual ceremonies from the sidelines,    they do so vocally, heckling poor performances to motivate improvement. Such    critique is not reserved for initiates or even guards, as even singers may be    ridiculed by post-officiants should opportunity arise. Accordingly, post-officiants    remain senior authorities in spiritual rituals despite being formally excluded    as participants. With an initiation interval of about 15 years, the entire succession    from initiate to post-officiant status may take approximately 45 years. Depending    on the age at which a young male is first initiated into the spiritual hierarchy,    attaining post-officiant status may occur relatively late in life.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Notions of age,    seniority, authority, and responsibility are all implicated in the spiritual    hierarchy. Whether one is a pre-initiate, initiate, guard, singer, or post-officiant,    his level of spiritual seniority has a bearing on how he interacts with others    during spiritual rituals and in daily social life. That dynamic is especially    apparent in the special antagonistic relationship between guards and initiates,    whereby guards have explicit juridical authority to enforce upon initiates certain    rules of behavior. Specifically, they prohibit initiates from eating certain    common foods, most notably the meat of numerous species of game animals. Guards    must liberate those foods one-by-one for individual initiates before they may    be freely eaten without fear of reprise. Should guards not liberate a food,    the prohibition does not terminate when one ceases to be an initiate. One 47-year    old post-officiant told me he was not yet authorized to eat marsh deer (<i>Blastocerus    dichotomus</i>), known as <i>cervo do pantanal</i> in Portuguese, or traira    fish (<i>Hoplias</i> sp.). Such hierarchical authority, expressed through ceaseless    surveillance and punitive retribution, impresses upon younger males the necessity    of behavioral obedience.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The oppositional    stance of guards towards initiates finds stark contrast in the very different    sort of relationship that exists between singers and initiates. Whereas guards    administer to initiates antagonistically, singers do not publicly attend to    them but are, in fact, their closest spiritual allies and private spiritual    mentors. They are considered both responsible for and together with (<i>dasir&eacute;</i>)    members of the initiate age grade. In private spaces and in hushed voices, singers    counsel initiates in secret aspects of Xavante spirituality. Shared between    them is a sense of shared mutual concern and absolute trust. Notably, singers    indulge initiates in keeping the secret of their violations of the dietary restrictions    imposed by guards. Thus, singers' interest in initiates' spiritual development    is of a categorically different nature than that of guards.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The contrastive    social dynamics between guards and initiates, on the one hand, and singers and    initiates, on the other hand, entails a structural logic of alternation similar    to that described above for the secular age-group system. As in the secular    age-group system, each of the spiritual grades is occupied by spiritual age    sets, which are life-long associations defined at the time of one's first initiation    into the spiritual system. Through the collective fifteen-yearly spiritual initiation    rituals (<i>darini</i>) their members are recruited and they comprise social    units for the greater part of adult life. Members of spiritual sets learn spiritual    knowledge together through the mutual experience of spiritual trials and the    common exercise of age-determined spiritual prerogatives. The unity of their    membership is expressed corporally through body painting and performance roles    specific to their spiritual grades and socially through an explicit morality    of secrecy and solidarity regarding spiritual matters.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike secular    age sets, spiritual age sets are not named.<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a>    Consequently, the cyclical aspect of eight rotating secular age-set names has    no parallel in the spiritual system. Also, men tend to discuss spiritual matters    in oblique terms and beyond the auditory range of other people, with the result    that spiritual age sets are somewhat invisible in the context of everyday speech.    Despite being unnamed and infrequently mentioned in public, spiritual age sets    are explicitly recognized social groups in the same sense as secular age sets.    I make that assertion based not only on observation, but also on conversations    with spiritual participants in which they explicitly described the system in    terms of cohorts that pass between age grades and are allocated in alternation    between two opposing sides. In this context, Xavante individuals used specific    terms to refer to one's own spiritual age-set moiety (<i>wasir&eacute; wai'a</i>)    and its complement (<i>wai'a amo</i>). They also spoke of the structural parallel    between the spiritual and secular age-grade systems, noting that the operation    of alternation is similar in both, despite the content of the spiritual domain    not being comparable to that of the secular domain.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The social solidarity    between singers and initiates also extends to alternate spiritual sets such    that every second spiritual set in the initiation sequence is linked by a sense    of mutual identity and a bond of sociospiritual unity. That unity establishes    them as spiritual companions and couples them in a pedagogical mentoring relationship    whereby singers are responsible for the indulgent cultivation of initiates'    spiritual capacities. They are the initiates' sources of spiritual knowledge    and guidance. Between them, spiritual subjects may be discussed openly, forbidden    words may be voiced, and spiritual transgressions may be acknowledged without    fear of recrimination. Alternate spiritual sets are allies, in that specific    context, and are bound by a code of mutual duty. Members of the same spiritual    moieties help one another, share with one another, and trust one another.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whereas members    of alternate spiritual sets are comrades, members of adjacent sets are adversaries,    as illustrated most explicitly by the social dynamic between guards and initiates.    Through the repetitive allocation of age sets between opposing moieties, alternate    age sets are joined in separate and opposed chains of solidarity. The two groups    are implicated in a total bifurcation of spiritual information rooted in an    ethos of distrust and constraint. Members of opposite spiritual moieties should    not, and in my experience do not, exchange spiritual knowledge. This restriction    is a somber one, as spiritual information is so carefully guarded precisely    to protect it from theft by those to whom it does not rightfully belong. Theft    of knowledge is thought to threaten its potency for its original owners and    grave sanctions are said to be levied against those who threaten its security.    Operating in secrecy from one another, opposing spiritual moieties maintain    their own, independent, bodies of spiritual knowledge and agendas of action.    When I inquired into the subject, members of both sides asserted in no uncertain    terms that neither they nor anyone else had any idea what was being taught in    the other moiety. In effect, they function as two separate but equal spiritual    traditions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Hierarchy and    symmetry</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the explanations    offered for age-group systems is that they facilitate militaristic organization.    Some scholars argue that they serve as alternate forms of political integration    in societies that lack centralized authority while others propose that they    provide a standard mode of military recruitment between otherwise unrelated    societies (Bernardi, 1952; Eisenstadt, 1954; Hanson, 1988; LeVine; Sangree,    1962). Based on a global cross-cultural examination of age-group organization,    Ritter (1980) concluded that age-group organization serves to integrate men    in societies that face constant warfare and in which local group composition    fluctuates due to ecological conditions. In order to substantiate her hypothesis    ethnographically and in South American context, Ritter presented Xavante age    organization as a case example. Common to each of those proposals is the idea    that age sets have a sociopolitically integrative function in warfare settings.    However, they differ regarding the nature of its integrative role. Eisenstadt    (1954) and Bernardi (1952) suggest it organizes people vertically through authority    while LeVine and Sangree (1962) suggest it organizes people horizontally through    recruitment.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My contemporary    ethnographic data do not permit historical reconstruction of the origins of    Xavante age-group systems and therefore do not allow me to confirm or refute    these hypotheses. However, the apparent disagreement regarding the nature of    age-set integration reveals a scholarly debate about whether age hierarchies    construct vertical or horizontal social relationships and illustrates the complex    nature of the relationship between social proximity and distance in age organization.    Responding to dilemma, I submit that Xavante age organization involves an integration    of these ostensibly contrastive principles. In both age-group systems, hierarchical    and differentiating dimensions simultaneously implicate principles of symmetry    and similarity. That is because both the secular and spiritual age-set moieties    are generated through the passage of age sets through age grades. Said another    way, symmetrical moieties and age-set ranks exist through and define one another.    In this sense, in these two age-group systems, dual symmetrical features (moieties)    are inseparable from hierarchical features (age grades and age sets). Thus,    in those contexts, Xavante culture deemphasizes the apparent antithesis of each    pair in favor of a formulation that prioritizes their mutuality.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My proposal echoes    other scholars' characterizations of G&ecirc; social dualism as congruent with    or presupposing asymmetrical structures (e.g., DaMatta, 1983; L&eacute;vi-Strauss,    1944, 1956; Seeger, 1989; Turner, 1984). However, such discussions generally    refer to asymmetry between pairs or in relation to an external point of reference.    In the examples presented in this paper, the form of dualism is categorical,    based on membership in explicit social groups (moieties), each of which is inherently    symmetrical with reference to the other. This symmetry derives from the diachronic    aspect of the age-set alternation, whereby each phase of the repetitive dynamic    is structurally equivalent to all others and each age set will, through time,    occupy all positions in the system. It is reflected in the terminological reciprocality    of the two sides as an opposition between "our side" and "their side," with    no absolute terminological reference for either moiety. At any given time the    arrangement of age sets in age grades will lend a temporary asymmetrical aspect    to the moieties, but the cyclical nature of that arrangement means that all    age sets and both moieties will in their turn assume all of the available positions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these systems,    the sources of asymmetry lie in a bifurcation of hierarchy between ranked age    sets within age-set moieties, which share a sense of social solidarity, and    ranked age sets between moieties, which assume rivalrous stances towards one    another. One possible reading of this form of hierarchy is that it contributes    to a particularly Xavante sociology of knowledge transmission that involves    contrastive methods of indulgence and tough-love. For example, on the one hand,    spiritual mentors cultivate in their socially proximate prot&eacute;g&eacute;s    the knowledge and skills necessary for spiritual maturation through social proximity.    On the other hand, spiritual guards help transform initiates into spiritually    capable adults by keeping strict vigil and discouraging misbehavior. According    to this view, although age asymmetrical relations between opposite-moiety adversaries    differ starkly from those between same-moiety allies, both are examples of respect    relationships, whereby individuals of different ages treat each other with socially    sanctioned forms of deference or esteem (Murdock, 1949; Schusky, 1965). In the    Xavante case, respect relationships are bifurcated into social solidarity and    adversarial dynamics for the mutual goal of transforming youth into responsible    and capable adults.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>A plurality    of age systems</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relevance of    recognizing that Xavante social organization involves two distinct age-group    systems lies not only in the logical and operational parallels that can be drawn    between them, but also in their very plurality. Maybury-Lewis called attention    to the plurality and apparent flexibility of Xavante age organization and other    social means of construing social identity and difference, such as moiety systems    (Maybury-Lewis, 1967). Silva similarly recognized the multiplicity of Xavante    social structures and questioned what theoretical conclusions might be drawn    from their fluid realities (Lopes da Silva, 1986). This plurality of age structures    is apparent not only in the age-group systems discussed in this paper, but also    in other dimensions of Xavante age organization. For example, the Xavante life    cycle also includes informal age grades that do not pertain to the formal secular    age-group system (Lopes da Silva, 1986; Maybury-Lewis, 1967; M&uuml;ller, 1976;    Welch, 2009). Also, evident in Maybury-Lewis's (1967) presentation of the Xavante    kinship terminology are abundant terms that distinguish relative age and which    suggest that seniority is a pervasive component of Xavante notions of relatedness.    Furthermore, accounts of Xavante political dynamics attest the importance of    seniority-based esteem for leadership and decision-making (Graham, 1995; Welch,    2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A similar observation    may be made about Xavante dual organization. Maybury-Lewis (1967, p. 296) wrote    that the "most immediately striking feature of G&ecirc; societies is their proliferation    of moiety systems." Indeed, my data attest to at least Xavante five moiety systems    (Welch, 2009). The first two stem from the spiritual and secular age-group systems,    as described in this paper. A third also pertains to the spiritual complex and    divides male participants into Wood-Owners (<i>wedeh&ouml;ri'wa</i>) and Rattle-Owners    (<i>umr&frac12;'tede'wa</i>) according to their fathers' perceptions of their    likely adult physical forms as either shorter and squatter or taller and thinner,    respectively. As Maybury-Lewis (1962, p. 136) described, the difference between    Rattle-Owners and Wood-Owners is they "involve intercession with two classes    of spirits, one conferring generative power (life) and the other aggressive    power (death)." Rattle-Owners appeal to a benevolent spirit (<i>danhimi'te</i>)    that is associated with the sacred cane arrows carried by senior initiates (<i>ti'ip&ecirc;</i>).    Wood-Owners fight and dominate a malevolent spirit called (<i>simi'h&ouml;'p&atilde;ri</i>)    that is responsible for destructive winds. A fourth moiety system involves two    ranked patrilineal segments, Tadpole (<i>poreza'&otilde;no</i>) and Big Water    (<i>&ouml;wawe</i>), which are exogamous and therefore inform marriage arrangements    (Maybury-Lewis, 1967). As one member of the Big Water moiety explained to me,    "We are the servants of the Tadpole moiety. We defend them and sweep up after    them." The Big Water moiety affords the Tadpole moiety ultimate decision-making    authority, with the right to appoint official leaders from among their own ranks.    The fifth is a division of the physical village into left (<i>danhimi'e</i>)    and right (<i>danhimire</i>) sides, based on house location, which serves to    organize village-wide distributions of food and goods (half of the goods are    distributed within the left side of the village and half are distributed within    the right side).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This multiplicity    of systems attests to another feature of Xavante social organization, which    is that it is extremely contingent. Xavante social reality entails such a diversity    of simultaneous hierarchical and symmetrical morphologies that it is highly    multidimensional. The spiritual and secular age-group systems are neatly illustrative    of this plurality. In both cases, rank involves the presumptive seniority of    maturity according to two contrastive configurations, one collegial and one    authoritative. Considered together, they also contribute to a complex tapestry    of social relations, in which there are no absolute power relationships, as    between, for example, younger or older, junior or senior, and subordinate or    dominant. Nor is there any absolute equivalence between age equals. Rather,    plural age classifications unite and differentiate individuals in multiple and    conditional ways that influence their modes of engagement in diverse social    settings. With numerous age hierarchies and oppositions operating at the same    time, the social significance of each is contingent upon the totality of any    given social dynamic, including the full complement of other age-based relationships    and how the individual actors involved make sense of them. Examples are in order.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The decision to    initiate a boy into the spiritual system and thereby assign him to a spiritual    age set lies with his father and is constrained by the relative infrequence    of opportunities to do so, since spiritual initiation rituals (<i>darini</i>)    tend to be held about every 15 years. Accordingly, each spiritual set includes    members of diverse secular age sets, which are inaugurated about every five    years, according to no formal system of correspondence between them. Thus, rank    in one system may be equalized or inverted in the other and moiety opposition    in one system may be transformed into moiety solidarity in the other.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At times, contrastive    structural relationships between the same people are compartmentalized according    to a logic of independent domains. For example, a moment of camaraderie and    indulgence between a secular age-set mentor (<i>danhohui'wa</i>) and his prot&eacute;g&eacute;    (<i>h&ouml;'wa n&otilde;ri</i>) may be followed, a short time later, by a grave    act of punishment between the same two people in a spiritual ritual (<i>wai'a</i>).    The two events may be interpreted by those involved as having nothing to do    with one another, with neither intimacy nor authority compromising the other    in their respective settings.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At other times,    seemingly contradictory relationships in different social domains are allowed    to influence one another. For example, should a spiritual guard (<i>dama'ai'a'wa</i>)    discover that a spiritual initiate (<i>wai'&atilde;ra</i>), his age-set mate    in the secular system, ate a prohibited food, he may choose not to punish him    in deference to their secular sense of comradeship. Conversely, that same spiritual    initiate may refrain from eating a prohibited food in front of the spiritual    guard, despite his being an otherwise trusted secular age-set mate, out of respect    for his superior spiritual status. Secrecy, essential to the Xavante morality    of age associations, is extremely useful in this respect because it may be employed    to mitigate or compartmentalize age relations. Using the same example, the spiritual    initiate may choose to hide his transgressions from his age-set mate to avoid    being punished or the spiritual guard may choose to guard as secret the age-set    mate's transgressions to protect him from punishment. Compartmentalization and    accommodation of age relations between domains are central to their sustained    practical and ideological compatibility.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following the same    principles, contrastive age status in one domain may serve to reinforce seniority    or juniority of shared age status in another domain at the same time that shared    status in one domain is not overtly thought to affect the integrity of rank    in another. For example, although there is no explicit coordination between    the spiritual and secular age-group systems, members of specific secular age    sets dominate the older and younger segments of spiritual age sets. Thus, when    I did my primary research, members of the secular <i>&ecirc;t&frac12;p&aacute;</i>    age set exclusively enjoyed status in the spiritual system as senior initiates    (<i>wai'&atilde;ra ipredumrini</i>). As a result, their spiritual activities    were often attributed to them as members of a secular rather than a spiritual    age-set. However, several years later, some members of the next secular age    set (<i>tirowa</i>) had also become senior initiates, causing that spiritual    stage to be occupied by members of two different secular age sets, which in    that system were adjacent and in opposite moieties. Although the members of    those two secular age sets treated each other as rivals in some other contexts,    during spiritual rituals they were joined in a project of mutual concern and    a shared trial of the highest order. There they stood side-by-side in equal    subordination to spiritual guards, who had policing and punishment authorities    over them all. Thus, age status in one domain may fragment the solidarity of    age status in another or, alternatively, unify members of otherwise antithetic    age sets.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These examples    of multiplex hierarchical and oppositional relationships that variously unite    and separate individuals within society point to a pervasive feature of Xavante    sociality - there is no single point of reference for constructing inclusive    and exclusive identity categories. Every outsider is also simultaneously an    insider. Every equal is also a senior or a junior. Status is not absolute and    is not fixed; it is contingent, transitory, and circumstantial. The Xavante    reality is that identity is multiple, that each formulation of identity has    its place and time, and that individuals of all ages have the autonomy to construe    those formulations as they see fit.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The notions of    rank and sidedness developed here in the contexts of the secular and spiritual    age-grade systems are just two among many dimensions of sociality that texture    how people view and interact with one another. Abundant other systems of social    organization are similarly ubiquitous aspects of the Xavante experience, providing    abundant means to unify certain sets of people as equals or similars and order    others as unequals or dissimilars. Some of those assume hierarchical or dual    morphologies while others do not. This plurality of social relations is not    unique to the Xavante; the same point might be made about any social network    in which people share multiple relationships that bear on their interactions    differently in different social contexts. Nevertheless, it is an especially    important point in relation to the Xavante life cycle because it entails such    a notable plurality of highly formalized forms of age organization.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have argued that    the Xavante spiritual age-group system involves a logic of hierarchy and symmetry    as mutually constituted that mirrors analogous organizational principles in    the secular age-group system. I also discussed how the interaction of those    two systems manifests in daily social engagement in order to illustrate my assertion    that important aspects of Xavante social organization are its plurality and    the resultant contingency that permeates the social experience. In the Xavante    social world, multiplex systems of equality and difference are essential to    how people understand the human life cycle.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The theme of plural    age and moiety organization is also apparent in ethnographic literature regarding    other G&ecirc; groups. Some scholars respond to the ethnographic fact of plurality    by asserting that some single structure is dominant or causal, thus essentially    denying its theoretical relevance (e.g., DaMatta, 1973, 1979, 1983; Carneiro    da Cunha, 1978; Coelho de Souza, 2002). Nevertheless, multidimensionality is    apparent in many G&ecirc; social systems. For example, although da Matta attributed    multiple Apinay&eacute; social structures to a single underlying opposition,    he simultaneously made the assessment that, "The social world of the Northern    G&ecirc; is disjointed and its dual ideology permits multiple readings of social    reality" (DaMatta, 1976, p. 247). Similarly, although Turner (1965) explained    Kayap&oacute; social structures in terms of a single underlying socioeconomic    and ideological dynamic, he also ascertained the abundance of contingent human    relationships and recognized that social organization simultaneously unites    and divides society. These examples attest to a theoretical difficulty in reconciling    structural plurality with singularity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There may be a    tendency on the part of some scholars to assume that plurality and heterogeneity    implies contradiction. That possibility is apparent in scholarship that asserts    the impossibility of simultaneous social roles. For example, Turner (1965, p.    412) wrote that in Kayap&oacute; society, for a man to become a husband and    father he must cease to be a brother. Similarly, Jackson (1975, p. 318) identified    one way of understanding the variability of G&ecirc; social alignments as a    "surplus" of memberships, whereby for one to be activated others necessarily    must be inactivated. Those characterizations emphasize a dynamic whereby one    dimension of social reality is emphasized at the expense of another.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My research suggests    that such compartmentalization is not the only possible strategy for reconciling    the multiplicity of social relations that exist between individuals. Another    involves their simultaneous integration by allowing status in one domain to    affect status in another. That dynamic is more closely aligned with the theoretical    position that social organization is thoroughly plural and simultaneous. Crocker    and Crocker (2004) illustrated that position when they accounted for multiple    Canela age hierarchies and dual structures as alternative systems that serve    to counterbalance one another for the sake of greater overall social solidarity.    Melatti (1970, 1978, 1979) took a similar position in arguing that in Krah&ocirc;    society, multiple social and ideological configurations negate one another,    thereby denying social contrast and increasing the overall equality of individuals.    An important insight in Melatti's work is his description of the availability    of multiple social perspectives. As he wrote, "Krah&ocirc; rites appear to give    individuals the possibility to view social relations and the relations between    the elements of the Universe, as they imagine them, from different points of    view" (Melatti, 1978, p. 357). These theoretical positions are important because    they recognize the irreducibility of multiplex social organization.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fisher (1991) took    these ideas even further in describing Kayap&oacute; social structure as fundamentally    contingent. According to his evaluation, the plurality of social structure is    both simultaneous and mutually exclusive such that in the kinship realm "there    is an internal relation between hierarchy, equality, and identity" (Fisher,    1991, p. 480). According to his view, one can simultaneously assume multiple    roles and can switch between them in turn, a paradox that contributes to the    conditionality of social status and the unpredictability of social action. Such    is also the case in Xavante society, where multiple systems for reckoning age    in absolute and relative terms contribute to a complex terrain of social unity    and differentiation. It is a social landscape that stimulates and denies the    distinctions between such heterogeneous oppositions as hierarchy and equality,    separation and integration, individuality and collectivity, and similarity and    difference.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BAMBERGER, J.

I am especially grateful to members of my secular age set (<i>&ecirc;t&frac12;p&aacute;</i>)    for their camaraderie and to members of my spiritual age-set moiety (<i>wasir&eacute;    wai'a</i>) for their insights. Valuable comments were provided at various stages    of the writing process by William Bal&eacute;e, Ricardo Ventura Santos, Carlos    E. A. Coimbra, Jr., and Nancy Flowers. This research was made possible by funds    provided by the Fulbright Commission (Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research    Abroad Fellowship, Award No. P022A040016) and the Tulane Anthropology Graduate    Fund. Additional site visits were made during subsequent research projects funded    by the Brazilian Research Council (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico    e Tecnol&oacute;gico - CNPq, post-doc fellowship 500288/2009-7 and grant MCT-CNPq/MS-SCTIE-DECIT/CT    40.0944/2005-7).    <br>   <a name="back1"></a><a href="#top1">1</a> Spelling of native terms follows the    orthography currently in use by Xavante teachers at the Pimentel Barbosa Municipal    School. It is an orthography in transition, originally developed by missionary    linguists (Hall, McLeod; Mitchell, 1987; Lachnitt, 2003) based on local dialects    and later modified through its application and transmission by literate Xavante    individuals at Pimentel Barbosa/Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute;. The system, as it    is currently applied, differs from versions in use in other Xavante communities    (especially in a preference for using <i>s</i> instead of <i>ts</i> and <i>z</i>    instead of <i>dz</i>) and even from previous representations in publications    coordinated by members of the Pimentel Barbosa/Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute; community.    <br>   <a name="back2"></a><a href="#top2">2</a> Fieldwork consisted of 12 months residency,    from 2004 to 2005, and several visits each year thereafter. The study was approved    by the Tulane University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the National Commission    on Research Ethics (Comiss&atilde;o Nacional de &Eacute;tica em Pesquisa - CONEP).    Research permits were issued by the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology    (Minist&eacute;rio da Ci&ecirc;ncia e Tecnologia - MCT), directives no. 420    on August 25, 2004 and no. 604 on September 19, 2005. Permission to conduct    research in the Pimentel Barbosa Indigenous Reserve was granted by the Brazilian    National Indian Foundation (Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Nacional do &Iacute;ndio    - FUNAI), authorizations no. 65/CGEP/04 and 68/ CGEP/05. In accordance with    Xavante protocol, the aims and scope of the project were presented to community    leaders and at the <i>war&atilde;</i>, a meeting of mature adult males held    daily at dawn and dusk in the center of the village. Although consent for the    research was granted at the <i>war&atilde;</i> by the mature men on behalf of    the community, individuals were allowed to decline to participate in the project    in whole or in part for any reason and without prejudice.    <br>   <a name="back3"></a><a href="#top3">3</a> In May, 2004, when I began fieldwork,    the subject community resided in a single village called Pimentel Barbosa or    Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute;. In late 2006, that village divided for internal political    reasons. Subsequently, my research included both villages. For simplicity, I    refer to the pre-division village and both post-division villages as Pimentel    Barbosa/Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute;.    <br>   <a name="back4"></a><a href="#top4">4</a> The order for some other communities    is <i>tirowa</i>, <i>h&ouml;t&ouml;r&atilde;</i>, <i>airere</i>, <i>sada'ro</i>,    <i>anharowa</i>, <i>noz&ouml;'u</i>, <i>abare'u</i>, and <i>&ecirc;t&frac12;p&aacute;</i>    (Maybury-Lewis, 1967).    <br>   <a name="back5"></a><a href="#top5">5</a> For the purposes of this study, I    consider "structures" to be the relationship morphologies that link people and    contribute to their social statuses in society. That formulation loosely follows    L&eacute;vi-Strauss (1963) and is similar to what Radcliffe-Brown (1952) called    "structural form". I apply the notion of social structure in such a way as to    anticipate that it overlaps with and engages other dimensions such as social    relations, patterns of social behavior, social roles, social values, social    ideologies, and social institutions (L&eacute;vi-Strauss, 1963; Parsons, 1951;    Radcliffe-Brown, 1940, 1952). Furthermore, I consider social structure to be    inextricably linked to individual experience, and therefore to such anthropological    concepts as practice, praxis, action, agency, and personhood (Bourdieu, 1972;    Fuchs, 2001; Giddens, 1979; Harris, 1989; Ortner, 1984).    <br>   <a name="back6"></a><a href="#top6">6</a> During my fieldwork at Pimentel Barbosa/Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute;,    females did not participate in spiritual rituals. However, there is historical    evidence from other Xavante communities that women were sometimes included as    a form of disgrace in cases of spousal mistreatment (Giaccaria; Heide, 1984).    My informants at Pimentel Barbosa/Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute; corroborate that    account, but attributed female participation to the transgression of having    engaged in indiscriminate sex. According to my sources, women have not participated    in spiritual ceremonialism at Pimentel Barbosa/Et&ecirc;nhiritip&aacute; for    many years. This account is supported by Nancy Flower's observations in the    same community between 1976 and 1996 (Personal communication, November 7, 2007).    <br>   <a name="back7"></a><a href="#top7">7</a> Although some definitions of age sets    require that they have names, there is ample ethnographic evidence of age-group    systems with unnamed age sets (Stewart, 1977).</font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

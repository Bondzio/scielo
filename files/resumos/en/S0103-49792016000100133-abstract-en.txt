In this article we analyzed some forms of resistance of immigrant workers from rural areas of the Northeast region who work harvesting sugar cane for sugar-alcohol works in the state of SÃ£o Paulo. More attention was given to the analysis of some &#8220;spontaneous&#8221; movements played by sugar cane harvesters &#8211; called &#8220;stopper&#8221; or &#8220;strike&#8221; &#8211; that occurred from 2007 to 2012. Our goal is to understand these movements, how the action begins, are there leaders, what are the strategies used for mobilizing the workers, what other social actors are involved: unions, work attorneys and church groups. The article is based on field diaries, semi-structured interviews with workers and union members, newspaper articles and audiovisual documents. These resistance actions happen during a period of change in work relationships, influenced by the growing mechanization in sugar cane harvesting and a more strict control of work conditions promoted by the Department of Employment and Work and the Public Department of Work.

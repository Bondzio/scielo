Abstract This paper explores the hypothesis that the accelerated multiplication of The Theatre of the Oppressed, founded by Augusto Boal in the early 70s, has suffered appropriations which have questioned its emancipatory project. This is based on a participative/collaborative project, started four years ago, in the context of collective actions and mobilizations - demonstrations, strikes, protests - against austerity measures imposed by the Portuguese government and mandated by European authorities in response to the economic and financial crisis. The empiric data, testimonies from interviews and debates, has been analyzed around a set of categories aimed to discuss the mutations, weaknesses and battles of TO today. The analysis highlights the need of reinvention and re-appropriation of methodology, particularly in times of crisis, such as the ones we are currently experiencing.

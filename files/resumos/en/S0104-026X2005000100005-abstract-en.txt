This article analyzes the film Frida (2003), directed by Julie Taymor and starred by Salma Hayek, which features the love relationship between the mural artist Diego Rivera and the painter Frida Khalo. It is not a filmic biography, but focuses on a period of the painter's life. On the one hand, it presents some comparison with the Mexican movie about the painter, Frida, naturaleza viva (1983), by Paul Leduc, to contrast different views on the events of a life, as to, for example, what concerns sexual politics. On the other hand, the paper explores to what extent the polemical film by Taymor/Hayek is historical, based on reality, or whether it is a sight-and-sound fictional version of a written biography.

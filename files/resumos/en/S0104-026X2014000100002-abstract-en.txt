The central point of Philip Pettit's theory, fundamental reference in the so-called neorepublicanism, is the concept of freedom as non-domination: a free person is one who does not live under arbitrary will or domination of others. For him, this crucial concept unifies new republican's authors, despite their analytical variations, and can articulate concerns of several contemporary movements such as the feminist. This paper analyzes the closeness and tension between Pettit's republicanism and some of the concerns present in the plural and heterogeneous field of feminist theory. We advocate the argument that, if treated as a political regulator, the ideal of freedom as non-domination can be very useful to feminists.

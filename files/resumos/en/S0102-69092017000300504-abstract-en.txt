This article presents an investigation about the determinants of trust in the police forces and in the legitimacy of laws. It is based on a survey held in the SÃ£o Paulo City, in 2013. The analysis tests a few hypotheses that are present in the international scenario and preconize that the perception of certain institutionalized conducts performed by the police officers, which are referred to as procedural justice (such as respect, clarity about decisions taken, and the ability to listen), has greater impact in the legitimization process of police forces than factors related to police efficacy. The survey results, which partially corroborate with the findings in the international literature, highlighting a significant association between institutional trust and the variables related to the dimensions of procedural justice and police efficacy. The results also indicate the association between the legitimacy of laws and the scope of procedural justice to a lower degree than that observed in relation to trust.

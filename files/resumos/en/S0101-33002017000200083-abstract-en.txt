ABSTRACT Using sociodemographic data (PNAD and PED), the authors document that the working poor are the most likely to use the public intermediation system (Sine), characterized by its slow-ness and inefficiency. Can we expect that private intermediaries create the conditions for the economic inclusion of the poorest? Our findings stress the relevance of public intermediation policy as a key dimension for sustaining redistributive initiatives.

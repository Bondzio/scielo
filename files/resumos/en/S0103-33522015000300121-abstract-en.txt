In the text, which is the introductory chapter of the book Class counts, Wright argues for the relevance of class analysis to the understanding of contemporary society and politics. Although the variable "class" alone does not explain all social phenomena and is not part of their explanations, it is significant for a wide variety of them. Therefore, it should be systematically exploited in investigations of sociology and politics. Wright also claims the superiority of the Marxist reading of social classes, which is able to cover more aspects than Weberian reading. And finally, she argues that such analysis must take as its starting point an understanding of the class structure, rather than simply its conflicts. Ownership of means of production matter for the design of that structure, but also control of expertise and authority in labor relations.

This work intends to analyze the evolution of the labor relations in Uruguay, at the cornerstone of the productive restructuring processes that began to be developed starting from the constitution of regional markets in the Southern Cone. The hypothesis we support is that the transformations in the world of labor ocurred in Uruguay cannot be attributed only to the application of an economical or social model specific to development, but are enrolled in long term structural modifications, associated to changes in the social relations ocurred worldwide. However, the concrete evolution verified in labor relations is explained by the specific characteristics of the processes of regional integration that are expressed in the conformation of MERCOSUL.

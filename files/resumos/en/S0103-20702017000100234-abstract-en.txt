Abstract This paper presents theoretical and methodological considerations to possible sociological approachs on recurring images of femininity in advertising and digital media streaming in social networking sites. One problematizes the most common approaches to advertising images of female gender and its relations to the notion of &#8220;representation&#8221; usually contrasted with &#8220;reality.&#8221; It is proposed a differentiated approach to overcome this dichotomy and take into account the present context of images flow through digital media and new communication technologies. At the same time, it takes in consideration the potential contributions of such media to constitute performances and identitary references of gender.

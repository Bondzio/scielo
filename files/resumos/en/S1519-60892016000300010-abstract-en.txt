Abstract: Based on Frantz Fanon's contributions, this article shows that colonialism &#8211; through racism &#8211; creates a polarized division of the world into a zone of being and a zone of non-being. We argue that colonial subjects in general and black people in particular live in a zone of non-being and, therefore, have been invisibilized by the imperial eye. Considering that, black people should make their existence visible by affirming their identity and body. We conclude that the black body's affirmation allows one to elaborate knowledge from a particular standpoint as well as reinvent a humanistic political project.

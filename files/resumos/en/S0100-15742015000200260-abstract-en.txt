The article approaches the idea of "historical memories" which, as a conceptual instance of the phenomenon of social memory, designates the "memories of history" constructed by people that were involved in facts that became "historical". The present study falls within the realm of social psychology, having no implication for the scientific production of history. Thus, this paper attempts to distinguish it from the "memorial history" which constitutes an alternative type of history, based on the memories of the participants in certain events and without subjecting them to the classic criteria of historic research or of rigorous psychosocial analysis. It is concluded that, understood as an academic undertaking in the tradition of social psychology, "historical memories" do not claim any relation to true history. They are conceived as memories, not as history, which products do not bear exclusive contribution to their formation, seeing that there is more to the historical memory than history could provide.

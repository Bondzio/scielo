This article aims to show the diversity of Brazilian agriculture, which is composed by a highly productive and efficient segment made of corporations, a segment also efficient and profitable, entrepreneurial family, and a segment of poor family farmers or peasants who produce for consumption, lives in the establishment, generates jobs for the children, and that does not migrate because its opportunity cost to migrate is low. The absence of economies of scale in agriculture, the low profitability of activity according to the low turnover of fixed capital, the competitive environment of the agricultural market and the risks affecting the activity (climate, pests and rates), do not cause interest in dominating it by a single sector producers, and this makes room for peaceful coexistence between heterogeneous rural sectors, each with its own logic and its own interests and demands.

Abstract: The article aims to systematize and discuss the premises conducting the recent public debate in the Brazilian society regarding the inclusion of gender and sexuality-related contents in the National Education Plan. It is a documental socio-anthropological research with documents extracted from public internet sources between 2011-2017, comprising government bodies, non-governmental organizations, and several news sites. The social construction of gender and sexuality perspective is questioned for being disruptive to the family for certain religious and political segments, being its approach in the school considered inappropriate. Another view is based on the discrimination and violence suffered by the students, due to the persisting stigma and gender inequality in the school settings. Thus, such contents would aid in the educational process of coexistence with sexual, gender and racial diversity. In this debate, sociocultural and political dimension of gender and sexuality are affirmed. Intervenient aspects in the approval of public policies indicate difficulties to guarantee the secular State, denoting what Carrara refers as &#8220;new geography of evil and sexual danger&#8221; when discussing sexual policies and their peculiar styles of moral regulation.

ABSTRACT In the paradoxes of the national and the foreign that marked the modernism, the disease of Nabuco was a sort of emblem with high cultural significance. It was almost always treated from the perspective of an import matter, artistic or literary, but little has been said about the landscape and the historical background of its content. This the first point of this paper, which explores the value of ancientness at the experience of the landscape, very present in the reflection on the role of the travel chronicles in real and imaginary transfigurations of Brazil, during the first half of the twentieth century. Finally, the paper discusses the critique and especially the way by which that generation dealt with the attraction of the world and the desire of a Brazilian cultural originality.

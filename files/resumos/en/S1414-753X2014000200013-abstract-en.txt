In order to encourage changes in the construction industry for adequation to sustainability schedule, green certification systems for buildings were developed in several countries. Mainly focused on issues related to natural resource consumption and environmental impacts, these tools are also called green stamps for buildings. To identify the best performing certification for residential buildings in Brazil, this paper shows a comparative analysis. The three most used certification systems in Brazil were selected: LEED for Homes, AQUA Process and Selo Casa Azul. For the investigation it was used the decision assistance tool Analytic Hierarchic Process (AHP). The AHP allows evaluation of multiple criteria, with data that can be both qualitative and quantitative. This study demonstrated that the stamp developed for Brazilian reality, Selo Casa Azul, has better performance to assess the habitations in Brazil.

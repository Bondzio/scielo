In this article we will analyze Gioconda Belli's women's universe, through both the view of three female protagonists, who decisively articulate their lives, and the literary esthetics of the author. We will begin by analyzing Virginia, the female protagonist of La mujer habitada (1988), her first novel; then we will examine Sofia, main character of Sofía de los presagios (1990), her second novel; and last, we will investigate the characteristics of a female character that proposes a new reading of the mythical Joan of Castilla, protagonist of El Pergamino de la seducción (2005). The three female literary characters are born from their own experiences along with memory, inseparable partner in the consolidation of the I, and they are the heroines of the own history.

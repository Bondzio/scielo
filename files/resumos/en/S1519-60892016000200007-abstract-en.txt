Abstract The article explores the household economy of middle class and skilled working class families living in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires, and problematizes family dynamics and social inequalities that are (re)produced by it. The proposal is part of a study where we analyze the reproduction of social classes through everyday practices in health care, education and household economy, from a social phenomenological perspective. We carried out biographical interviews with parents of 31 heterosexual, two-parent and single-parent families, living with children or young sons and daughters. We conclude that the temporal dimension of money circulation causes different experiences between middle class and working class families, and works as a (re)production mechanism of gender and class inequalities.

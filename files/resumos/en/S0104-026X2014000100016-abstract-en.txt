In this article, we present a critical analysis of governmental actions, plans, and programs, regarding public security, directed toward the LGBT population in Brazil. Despite the identification of many proposals and certain ongoing initiatives, some of them planned during public discussions involving the government and the civil society, the final outcome shows an absolute imbalance between homophobic violence and Brazilian governmental actions to change this scenery. This finding helps understand why LGBT people regard the State and its representatives with distrust, in several fields of social life where their civil rights are denied, but especially in the public security sphere, where the nexus between questioning the heterosexual norm and violence is still recurrent.

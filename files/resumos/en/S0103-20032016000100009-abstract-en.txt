Abstract: In the Northeastern region of Brazil, production alternatives that are economically feasible are scarce and the organic acerola production can be set among those which increases income and keep the families in the rural areas. Therefore, this study aims to assess the feasibility of the organic acerola production under deterministic and risk conditions in the Irrigation District of Tabuleiro Litorâneo of Piauí State, Brazil. To this end, we used primary data gathered from a sample of 23 producers in 2011. As methods of analysis, we applied measurements of economic outcomes for the deterministic assessments and the Monte Carlo simulation method for risk analysis. The deterministic evaluation showed that ten producers from the sample were economically infeasible while the other had acceptable profitability. For risk analysis, we obtained similar results, noting that producers who had developed the activity without following technical recommendations were impractical and faced higher risk, whereas those who are more technified have higher profitability and lower risk. We suggest carrying out public policies such as the provision of training programs in organic acerola production and agricultural management and marketing, in addition to individualized technical assistance to support producers in the right use of inputs.

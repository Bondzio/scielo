<p>This study explores the effects of electoral rules on political polarization in
					the legislative branch of government. Since in Brazil the districts are also the
					states, and senators are chosen according to the plurality-majority rule while
					representatives are determined by a proportional rule, the comparison between
					legislative chambers enables one to test whether the plurality-majority rule
					induces politicians to behave less moderately, and whether the proportional rule
					has the opposite effect. To estimate these effects, roll call data from 1988 to
					2010 was analyzed and legislators' ideal points were estimated using
						<em>WNOMINATE</em>. Evidence in favor of the hypothesis was found,
					although not in every circumstance.</p>

<div id="article-body" class="body">
<p>This article explores the influence that particular electoral rules may have on political
			polarization. More specifically, the polarization in the legislative chambers, measured
			by the way legislators vote in roll calls. In this paper, I will explore how two
			different vote-counting rules affect the relationship between legislators and their
			parties. This relationship is understood by the concept of polarization. When the
			members of one party vote in one way and those of the other party vote in another way,
			and if this behavior is observed most of the time, then these two parties can be
			described as polarized. In a roll call vote, a legislator can either cast a "yea" or a
			"nay" vote. As this procedure is done repeatedly in one legislature, we can measure how
			similar, aggregated, or even polarized, are the members of two or more distinct parties.
			There can be many causes of polarization. In McCarty, Poole and Rosenthal (2006), the
			authors argue that income, immigration, and campaign finance affect polarization. Here I
			am going to argue that the method of counting the votes by which a legislator is elected
			can also have an effect on polarization. The relevance of such a study becomes
			noticeable when there is a redesign or reformation of an electoral system, to identify
			the practical consequences of different electoral rules. The seminal work on the topic
			is <sup><a href="#B8">Duverger (1957)</a></sup>, in which the author shows that
			a plurality-majority rule leads to political systems with two parties, whereas a
			proportional rule enables multi-party systems to continue their existence. However, the
			relationship between electoral rule and legislative behavior has not yet been fully
			scrutinized. If a plurality-majority rule leads to a less fragmented party system, it is
			reasonable to expect that the legislators of a party would behave in a more loyal way.
			This hypothesis is investigated in this paper.</p>
<p>Electoral rules are frequently analyzed with regard to their normative features, such as
			representativity and rationality. However, it is important to understand the practical
			consequences that a rule may have such as political polarization. The Brazilian case
			studied here is helpful to test the effect of two electoral rules on political
			polarization; plurality-majority and proportional rules. This paper will show that the
			members of Congress elected through the plurality-majority rule behave more extremely
			than those elected via the proportional rule, <em>i.e.</em>, they vote more
			often with their party. As will be explained presently, the different electoral rules in
			Brazil take the same district and transform it into either a single or multi-member
			district.</p>
<p>The study of polarization in the U.S. Congress has gained scientific rigor with both the
			application of spatial models and the empirical estimation of ideology using large data
			sets. This confluence resulted in the ubiquitous mode of analysis enabled by algorithms
			like <em>NOMINATE</em> and <em>Optimal Classification</em>. In this
			study, an extension of <em>NOMINATE</em> called <em>WNOMINATE</em> is
			used. <em>WNOMINATE</em> takes the roll call records of legislators and two
			policy dimensions as input, calculates their proximity to each other, and returns the
			position of legislators in the policy space spanned by those dimensions. The two
			dimensions are fiscal and social ones, and they are constrained by the unit Euclidean
			circle. The algorithm normalizes the positions such that politicians that are
			conservative in both fiscal and social issues receive coordinates on the positive
			orthant. History, detailed theoretical explanation, as well as the application of this
			methodology to American Politics can be found in <sup><a href="#B26">Rosenthal and Poole (2007)</a></sup> and <sup><a href="#B14">McCarty,
				Poole and Rosenthal (2006)</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress presents an added difficulty when comparing chambers though; the pool
			from which the subjects are drawn differs between the House and the Senate. The members
			of the House are selected from smaller districts, while members of the Senate come from
			the states. This is not the case with Brazil's Congress, and this feature is explored in
			this paper. Brazilian legislative elections on the federal level provide me with an
			institutional design well-suited to test the effects of two electoral rules on political
			polarization, namely the plurality-majority and proportional rules. The electoral
			features that enable this test to occur are: first, and most important, each state
			covers a single district only and there is no further division within it; and second,
			the electoral rules differ from one chamber to the other. Hence, the same district can
			be a single-member district in the Senate's case, and a multi-member district in the
			House's case.</p>

<a name="idp7512512"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Literature Review</p>
<p>The first two pieces of work on polarization were <sup><a href="#B23">Rosenthal and Poole (1984)</a></sup>, which looks into interest groups'
				classifications of legislator behavior, and <sup><a href="#B24">Rosenthal and Poole (1985)</a></sup>, which stated the use of roll call data
				directly via <em>NOMINATE</em>. The seminal work in polarization literature
				is <sup><a href="#B25">Rosenthal and Poole (1997)</a></sup>, revised as
					<sup><a href="#B26">Rosenthal and Poole (2007)</a></sup>. In this book
				the authors seek to understand the structure of congressional voting in the U.S.,
				and to explain the political realignment in American history. The impact of
				committees and interest groups are also investigated. The main finding of this
				research is that American politics have had alternate times of polarization in the
				past, but that a strong and increasing polarization pattern has arisen in the last
				few decades. Among the exogenous causes of this phenomenon are income inequality and
				immigration. A study that claims different findings on polarization of American
				politics is <sup><a href="#B10">Evans (2003)</a></sup>. The author uses
				alternative statistical methods, along with survey data, to argue that American
				voters are not as polarized as legislators when it comes to economic issues, but the
				polarization of voters on moral issues is increasing<sup><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the present study I do not necessarily have the American case in mind, as I seek
				to unravel the existence of an institutional cause of polarization. My research
				approach is reversed; I posit an institutional cause of polarization and look for an
				empirical validation of the hypothesis. Also, I am interested in the behavior of the
				legislators only, and not of the voters. One previous study that links electoral
				rules and legislative behavior is <sup><a href="#B3">Carrol and Eichorst
					(2013)</a></sup>, where the authors show that the greater the competition, the
				higher the predictability of legislators' behavior. The findings in my study however
				could have arisen independent of the relationship in <sup><a href="#B3">Carrol and Eichorst (2013)</a></sup>. This is because it is possible to have
				electoral competition independent of the electoral rule. Admittedly and intuitively,
				one should expect greater competition correlating with greater number of parties,
				but this relation can be upside down. If there are two strong parties and no others,
				there must be more competition than a situation with one strong party and many
				electorally insignificant ones.</p>
<p>The methodological foundations of the polarization research borrowed the Item
				Response Theory (IRT) from Psychology. In comparing attitudes among individuals
				towards similar questions, IRT provided a way of not only ordering subjects by their
				abilities or preferences, but also measuring the distance among those subjects. What
				political science researchers began to do then was to apply the IRT methodology to
				analyze and quantify ideological mappings, in Congress and Executive branches<sup><a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a></sup>, first through the use of interest
				groups' ratings of politicians, and later through the use of roll call data via
					<em>NOMINATE</em>. (<sup><a href="#B22">POOLE, 2005)</a></sup>
				provides technical work on this issue<sup><a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></sup>. Here I use roll call data, which has become the standard
				way of investigating ideological mappings, for it is much more objective than
				interest groups' evaluations. An introductory tutorial of the methodology utilized
				in the classification of legislators using roll call data is Wiseman, Everson and
				Valelly (2008/2009), while <sup><a href="#B20">Poole (1998)</a></sup>
				provides an intellectual—and as non-technical as it can ever be—recount of the
				origin and development of the <em>NOMINATE</em> family of methods. There
				remains only a few studies dealing with the topic of polarization in Brazilian
				politics. <sup><a href="#B11">Leoni (2002)</a></sup> was the first study to
				bring the <em>NOMINATE</em> technology to Brazilian politics. The article
				describes the ideological map of parties in the House and the first three presidents
				after redemocratization, covering the 1991–1998 period. His results are in favor of
				a low dimensionality with the left-right spectrum explaining most of the legislative
				behavior. <sup><a href="#B17">Morgenstern (2004)</a></sup> looks at the
				period from 1995 to 1998 and argues that the Congress has more power than the
				President when it comes to law-making. <sup><a href="#B6">Desposato
					(2006b)</a></sup> studies the same legislatures as Morgenstern, but to test a
				party-switching model.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#B30">Zucco Jr. and Lauderdale (2011)</a></sup> use survey
				data to correct ideological mappings using roll call data, and find that there also
				exists a government-opposition cleavage in Brazilian congress, apart from the
				left-right dispute. Our research will encompass this issue when dealing with
				coalitions instead of parties. <sup><a href="#B7">Desposato and Cunow
					(2011)</a></sup> use campaign contributions for the 2010 presidential,
				gubernatorial, and congressional elections to estimate ideal points in Brazil. Their
				approach enables them to also grasp the ideology of the candidates who lost in the
				elections. They find mixed evidence of the impact of electoral rules on
				polarization. The first attempt to investigate the effect of electoral rules on
				polarization in Brazil was <sup><a href="#B5">Desposato (2006a)</a></sup>.
				In this study, the author uses a dispersion model to assess the legislators'
				behaviors on the Senate and the House. He finds no evidence of any impact of
				electoral rules on dispersion of legislatives of the same party, but only three
				legislatures were analyzed. This paper attempts to improve on that study by
				analyzing all the first six legislatures in the democratic period, and also by
				taking the coalitions into consideration. Mixed evidence of any impact of electoral
				rules on polarization is found. In <sup><a href="#B21">Poole
					(2003)</a></sup> the author argues that Congress members in the U.S. die with their
				ideological boot on, i.e., once in office, they tend to remain close to their
				original ideological position throughout time. A similar study in the Brazilian case
				is yet to be done. Another possible research topic is to compare the polarization of
				legislators in state chambers with the ones in the federal chamber. A study of the
				polarization of state legislators in American states is <sup><a href="#B27">Shor and McCarty (2011)</a></sup>, one that could also be replicated for
				the Brazilian case.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="idp7593392"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Electoral Rules and Polarization</p>
<p>The Brazilian political system is more similar to the American one than to most of
				those in Europe, in that the presidential elections are separated from the
				congressional ones<sup><a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a></sup>. With regards to
				congressional elections though, Brazilian electoral rules vary according to the
				chamber. In Brazil, the district from which the representatives are elected is the
				same political territory as the state from which the senators are elected. In other
				words, the states are the districts. But in the elections to the Senate the
				plurality-majority rule is used, which means that the candidate with more votes is
				elected, as in a single-member district<sup><a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a></sup>. In the elections for the House, however, a proportional
				rule is used, <em>i.e.</em>, the state becomes a multi-member district, and
				thence the representatives of that district, or state, are elected in accordance
				with the proportion of votes their parties receive<sup><a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>The assignment to either one of the candidacies is a joint decision made by the
				candidate and the party; nonetheless, the party has the final authority in
				determining who runs for the office. From the candidate’s point of view, there could
				exist a self-selection problem if either one of the offices was a better position
				than the other, as all candidates would want to run for that best position. From the
				party's perspective, however, a candidate should be assigned to an office according
				to his or her chances of winning the election, and their prospective behavior during
				incumbency. These issues are explored below in greater detail.</p>
<p>The Senate office is usually considered as a better position than the one in the
				House. Arguments in the favor of that are, first, the fact that the mandate is for
				eight years, compared with the four-year term in the House; and second, the total
				number of senators is less than 16% of the number of representatives, thus the
				senators' vote on a bill will likely be much more valuable. While there is no
				discrepancy between salaries, the senators do enjoy a larger sum of money to
					spend<sup><a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, it is more difficult to obtain the party's nomination to run for the Senate,
				for there are only one or two seats per state per election, depending on the
				election year—every four years, either one-third or two-thirds of the Senate seats
				are open. In the House, all seats open every four years, and the seats per district
				vary from 08 to 70. These numbers follow a distorted proportionality with regard to
				the states' populations<sup><a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a></sup>.
				Furthermore, each party can launch only one candidate per seat for the Senate, but
				50% more candidates than the number of seats for the House. Re-election works
				exactly as in the Senate, <em>i.e.</em>, the incumbents can remain in office
				for an undetermined number of terms.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is one feature that has not been taken into consideration in this
				discussion; the ability to vote with the party. Note that for a politician who is
				not a head of a party, his or her power in determining the party's agenda is small.
				Therefore, if the politician's policy preferences are not exactly the same as the
				party ones, there will be a cost, in terms of effort, for the politician to support
				the party's exact agenda. The partisan behavior then will be a function of the
				distance between the politician and the party, and the value he places in policy and
				office-holding. If someone places more value in the office than in the policy, then
				it will be easier for him or her to follow the party, holding fixed the ideological
				distance between the party and the politician. Conversely, if the value placed in
				the office is held fixed, then the closer the party and politician are
				ideologically, the easier for him to vote with the party. This will be an important
				issue, as we will see presently, for the party will expect a "better" behavior from
				the senators than from the members of the House.</p>
<p>Hence, when a politician is deciding on the type of nomination to procure, it is not
				clear whether the present expected value of a seat in the Senate is always greater
				than a seat in the House, <em>i.e.</em>, whether it is the case that for
				every politician it is better to try to run for the Senate than the House<sup><a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a></sup>. As I will show presently, the
				different offices appeal differently to distinct candidate types, according to their
				ability to fulfill the party's expectations.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the party though, a seat in the Senate is much more
				valuable than one in the House. One vote in the Senate counts <a target="_blank" href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v9n2//1981-3821-bpsr-9-2-0081-ii01.jpg"><img class="inline-graphic" src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v9n2//1981-3821-bpsr-9-2-0081-ii01.jpg"></a> of the total votes, while one
				vote in the House counts only <a target="_blank" href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v9n2//1981-3821-bpsr-9-2-0081-ii02.jpg"><img class="inline-graphic" src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v9n2//1981-3821-bpsr-9-2-0081-ii02.jpg"></a>. It is true that when the
				party's heads are deciding among persons to nominate as candidates, they must seek
				to maximize their vote-counting. Taking only this rationale into consideration, a
				more notorious, powerful, and experienced politician should have precedence in
				running for the Senate. However, winning features are of no help if the candidate,
				once elected, turns his back on his party and votes with the opponents. In this way,
				it is fundamental that the party trusts someone before giving him the opportunity to
				run for the Senate seat. Note that a defection by a House member would be less
				problematic for the party, since there are other representatives from the same party
				to pursue the party's agenda in the House. Moreover, the popularity of a candidate
				affects the composition of the House more than that of the Senate. This is because a
				popular candidate in a party list helps in securing the election of more candidates
				of the same party or coalition.</p>
<p>Therefore, the electoral rule may be the very mechanism through which confidence and
				loyalty bounds are tied together; in other words, the channeling of polarization may
				be influenced by the electoral rule. Suppose that for any reason, a politician
				secured his indication as candidate. Once in office, the candidate should
				reciprocate by voting with his party, in order to ensure that in the next election,
				the party will enable him to defend his seat. Hence, it can very well be the fact
				that as a more restrictive procedure, the plurality-majority rule used in the
				election to the Senate induces more partisan behavior. Of course, a person can be
				loyal to a party before even becoming a candidate, and this loyalty must be a
				crucial factor, among others, that induces the party to provide him with the
				opportunity to run for office.</p>
<p>This framework resembles the screening problems in which a principal offers a menu of
				tasks with different levels of difficulty, and the agent self-selects for a task
				according to his ability. Here the two tasks would be the run for a seat and the
				appropriate behavior as an incumbent in the Senate and the correlation for the
				House. The candidate would then evaluate not only his characteristics like previous
				popularity and partisanship history, but also how he would behave once in the Senate
				or House. As a defection in the House is less harmful than one in the Senate, the
				assignment of a candidate to run for the House can be termed as a lower task; and
				one for the Senate a higher task.</p>
<p>Once elected, any politician should abide by the re-election rationale mentioned
				above. The final test between the pre- and post-election effects could be conducted
				by estimating how the same person behaves in the House and in the Senate. This task
				is left for a future study.</p>
<p>The same re-election logic does not work as well for the House though, because a good
				candidate can bring benefits to the party even without being loyal. As the electoral
				rule for the House is proportional with an open list, a strong candidate may pull
				some other winners with him, and his vote will also count for a smaller fraction of
				the total. It therefore follows that even if this same candidate should misbehave in
				his seat, the party could internalize this cost, for the representative could again
				bring more elected candidates with himself the next time round.</p>
<p>Finally, it is noteworthy that this paper is attempting to solely measure the effect
				of a cause. Many other processes and variables concur to explain legislator
				behavior. However, it is not my intention to make thorough predictions about
				legislative decision-making. The idea is simply to elucidate first a qualitative
				finding—the existence of an influence of the electoral rules on the polarization of
				the legislative bodies—and then make an attempt to quantify that effect. One study
				that would walk alongside this one is <sup><a href="#B18">Neiva and
					Izumi (2012)</a></sup>. One finding in that paper is that senators substitute votes
				more in line with the Executive branch. These phenomena dwell under the
				party-discipline type of events. Another study of this kind is <sup><a href="#B15">Melo and Batista (2012)</a></sup>. Focusing on the higher chamber—and
				this is the novelty on the paper—the authors claim that party discipline in the
				Brazilian Senate compares with that of the House. These processes could, for
				instance, lead to increased polarization in the legislature.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="idp7624448"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Data</p>
<p>The case study explored in this paper was produced using roll call data from 1989 to
				2010 collected and generously shared by the Brazilian Center for Analysis and
				Planning (CEBRAP in its Portuguese acronym). This dataset covers a large part of the
				new democratic period, which began with the new Constitution and presidential
				elections in 1989. Another novelty in this paper is the fact that roll call data
				from the Senate was analyzed for the purpose of investigating polarization, which
				had not been done in previous studies. Elections to Congress occur every four years.
				A total of 513 representatives are elected for a four-year term, and either 54 or 27
				senators are elected for an eight-year term. Some members of Congress leave before
				completing their terms because of reasons such as taking an office at the Executive
				branch, running for governor, or being expelled from Congress by its colleagues in a
				political judgment. Hence, during each legislature, there may be more than 513
				representatives and 81 senators. In the period studied, the House had 1,958
				representatives and the Senate had 273 senators. The House members voted on 1,611
				roll calls, while the senators voted on 752 roll calls. On a roll call vote, the
				legislator is required to cast a vote, which is recorded, but this is not
				necessarily the case with other types of procedures. As an example, votes in a voice
				vote are counted but not recorded, while in a proxy vote, a legislator tells another
				to vote for him. In extreme cases, only the leaders of the parties would vote, and
				the votes of the regular legislators are assumed to be in accordance with one cast
				by the parties' leaders.</p>
<p>Most bills start in the House and if approved, go on to the Senate. If the Senate
				approves the bill, then it becomes a law. If the Senate makes modifications, it goes
				back to the House and has to be voted on again<sup><a href="#fn1"><sup>11</sup></a></sup>, which explains why the House has more roll calls than
				the Senate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7629376"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The empirical test</p>
<p>The empirical test proposed here does not have a control group <em>per
					se</em>, for any electoral rule could be seen as the treatment. Hence, this
				is a study where there are actually two different treatments; the plurality-majority
				rule and the proportional one. For the sake of clarity though, the plurality rule is
				denominated as the treatment and the proportional rule as the control. Hence, the
				legislators in the Senate are considered as the treatment group and the legislators
				in the House are considered as the control group.</p>
<p>The legislatives' behavior is explored in terms of ideal points, a measure of
				distance among them as estimated by <em>WNOMINATE</em> package in
						<em>R<sup><a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a></sup></em>. The
					<em>WNOMINATE</em>'s ideal points calculated here are two-dimensional,
				and lie in the unitary circle as seen in Figures 01 and 02. The estimates displayed
				in Tables 01 and 02 are the only ones in the first coordinate; this coordinate
				represents the economic dimension<sup><a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></sup>. A left-wing legislator, or in the case of this study, party,
				will probably lie in the [-1,0] interval. Conversely, a right-wing legislator or
				party should lie in the [0,1] interval. Once each legislator's points in the
				coordinates are estimated, the comparison is straightforward. One can look to the
				aggregated ideal points and see whether the treatment has a significant effect on
				polarization, <em>i.e.</em>, whether the estimates for a left-wing party are
				further to the left in the Senate than in the House, and whether the estimates for a
				right-wing party are further to the right in the Senate than in the House. It's
				important to mention that the algorithm's output is simply a map, stripped of any
				inherent ideological content. What gives one power to interpret the estimated
				coordinates with confidence is the fact that I input ideology on it prior to the
				estimation. The <em>WNOMINATE</em> function in the <em>R</em>
				package requires the researcher to pin down the dimensions by selecting a legislator
				who is notoriously a social and fiscal conservative. With this information, the
				algorithm returns dimensions that are aligned with ideology. The process would work
				fine if I used a social and fiscal liberal legislator, but the estimates would come
				out inverted. One could alternatively "create" a coalition/opposition dimension, and
				this could explain some legislative behavior. However, the fact that the analysis in
				this paper found very good estimates using the algorithm in its original mode
				provides us with greater confidence in the validity of the method.</p>
<p>Four estimations were run for each chamber separately. First, the means of the
				clustered parties' ideal points over the whole period were estimated. Then, those
				means were disaggregated by legislature. Third, the legislators were aggregated
				according to the coalitions to whom they belonged, <em>i.e.</em>, they were
				either members of the government coalition or not, and the effect was estimated for
				the whole period. Finally, the coalitions' behavior was estimated for each
				legislature separately. The estimations were run for every member of the Congress,
				and thence everyone participates in the results for the coalitions. However, the
				results for the parties cover only the main parties; Worker's Party (PT), Social
				Democracy (PSDB), Liberal Front (PFL-DEM), and Democratic Movement (PMDB)<sup><a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a></sup>. After its redemocratization,
				Brazil had more than two dozen parties with representation in the Congress, but the
				four mentioned above count for roughly 60% of the Congress members. Among these main
				four, PT has always been the furthest to the left while PFL-DEM the furthest to the
				right. PSDB shifted in 1995 from the center-left to the center-right, and has
				maintained this position until now. PMDB shifted from the center-right to the
				center-left in 2003, and has since remained so.</p>

<p>The ideal experiment to test whether the electoral rule affects legislator behavior
				would require the same legislator to be elected for both chambers at the same time,
				through different electoral rules, and voting on the same bills. This is probably
				not how most parliamentary bodies throughout the world work, and certainly it is not
				so for the Brazilian case. Moreover, even if such fiction were fact, there would
				still exist a remaining problem; the stable unit treatment value assumption would be
				violated. Note that the behavior a legislator would present in a chamber could, and
				probably would, be correlated with his behavior in the other chamber. It is unlikely
				that a person would vote differently on the same issue, at the same time, just
				because the bill was voted on in different chambers. Therefore, we would face an
				influence of treatment on control group, or vice-versa.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to compare the behavior of the legislators who transit
				between the chambers across time. It is not unusual to have House representatives
				elected for the Senate. One problem with this design is that the legislator would
				face different bills once in different chambers, for he would be a member of the
				chambers at different times, and the bills are usually voted on during the same
				legislative period. Also, the problem of correlated behavior mentioned above would
				persist. Aside from these problems, such a dynamic estimation can be performed, with
				the use of <em>DW-NOMINATE</em>, for example. <em>DW-NOMINATE</em>
				can estimate the individual legislator's behavior across time; the algorithm is not
				openly available though.</p>
<p>With the impossibility of a natural experiment, the identification strategy relies on
				the Brazilian electoral and legislative design. Remember that for electoral
				purposes, only the electoral rules distinguish how legislators are elected for the
				different chambers. This means that the district and the state are the same thing,
				and there are no demographic confounders in the analysis, for senators and
				representatives from the same state face the same constituency.</p>
<p>Moreover, every bill has to be voted on in both chambers in order to become law, and
				if one chamber makes amendments to a bill, these changes also have to be voted on in
				the other chamber. Hence, it is not the case that polarization occurs because of the
				kind of issues raised in the different chambers. These characteristics provide us
				with a suitable environment to test the effect of the electoral rules on
				polarization. Evidently, a better test would have legislators being randomly
				assigned to run for an office across different chambers. However, if there is a
				selection problem in the sense that one type of legislators select itself, or is
				selected by the party, to one of the chambers while another type is assigned to
				another chamber, this does not necessarily invalidate the hypothesis that the
				electoral rule is the polarization mechanism. If these types of legislators are in
				some manner correlated with the electoral rule, then the hypothesis remains sound.
				This possible mechanism will last black-boxed until data is gathered on possible
				causes of selection bias; for example, seniority in the party, previous loyalty,
				popularity, and economic power. Such a dataset is however not yet available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7657328"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Results</p>
<p>The main hypothesis tested in this study is that the Senate treatment,
					<em>i.e.</em>, the plurality-majority rule, has a positive effect in
				causing polarization. Two sets of strategies were used to estimate the effect of
				electoral rule on polarization: the aggregated effect in the whole period and the
				effect separated by legislature. Within these two sets, a further division is made
				in taking either the four main parties individually, or the coalitions they formed.
				The party's or coalition's ideological mean was estimated using
					<em>WNOMINATE</em>. This algorithm takes roll call data to order
				legislators relatively to their peers. Even though the different sorts of bills that
				are voted constitute a multidimensional space, it is usually the case that the
				behavior of legislators on any bill is predictable by one or two dimensions; the
				economic and social ones. The accuracy of these predictions will appear presently.
				More than ordering the legislators, <em>WNOMINATE</em> estimates the
				Euclidean distance among them in two dimensions, and in this way every individual is
				located on a unit disc. For the numerical analysis that follows, only the
				legislators' coordinate in the first dimension was taken into consideration. The
				first dimension, the economic one, describes how legislators locate on the usual
				left-right spectrum, and is the most explicative, or predictive, dimension. This
				means that the behavior of a legislator in this dimension can be used to predict how
				the same legislator is going to vote in other dimensions. For the sake of rigor, one
				may say that in this study, polarization is being investigated in terms of the
				economic spectrum. There is evidence that the main hypothesis is true,
					<em>i.e.</em>, the plurality-majority rule has a positive effect on
				polarization, although not all of the findings are unequivocal in confirming
				this.</p>

<a name="idp7663760"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Aggregated effect for parties</p>
<p><a href="#f01">Figure 01</a> is a graphical summary of the
				calculations for the House in the 1989–2010 period. The "coordinates circle"
				contains the disposition of the members of the House with a different symbol for
				each party. PT is represented by the green triangles, PSDB the green circles,
				PFL-DEM the orange squares, and PMDB the blue circles. Note that PT members are
				dispersed on the left, PSDB and PMDB members somewhat on the center, and PFL-DEM
				members on the right. This is just a descriptive plot to help the visualization of
				legislators in the ideological space. Because the number of representatives is much
				larger than that of senators, a comparison between the coordinates shown on <a href="#f01">Figures 01</a> and <a href="#f02">02</a> is not sufficient to test the hypothesis. The plot showing
				cutting-line angles indicates that the first dimension is well-suited to explain the
				cleavage in the House, <em>i.e.</em>, most of the bills separate legislators
				in the economic left-right spectrum. This plot just shows the distribution of
				cutting lines. We can see the cutting-lines plot below, and an explanation will be
				given presently. The screen plot shows the factor analysis in which gains in
				explanation are still to be obtained when we increase the dimensionality of the
				legislatures in the model. In contrast to U.S. legislatures, Brazilian legislatures
				present a higher dimensionality, for the line flattens out only after the eighth
				value. At each value on the horizontal axis, the value on the vertical axis shows
				the gain in explanation moving away from the previous dimensionality. We can see
				that substantive gains in explanation can be achieved using two dimensions instead
				of one, or four instead of three, for example. After the eighth dimension no
				significant gain is obtained. Still, for the purposes of this study, this higher
				dimensionality does not represent a threat, since finding polarization on the first
				dimension will already evince confirmation of the hypothesis. Finally, the cutting
				lines displayed are a random sample of how legislators were separated in the roll
				calls, and we can again see that most of them separate legislators in the first
				dimension. As the Euclidean distance is used, these lines are the separating
				hyperplanes in two dimensions<sup><a href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a></sup>.
				Note that superimposing the cutting lines plot on the coordinates plot results in
				the separation of PT members and PFL-DEM ones. Even the more horizontal lines
				separate these two sets of legislators, which indicates that among the four main
				parties in Brazil, PT is the most fiscal and social liberal party, while PFL-DEM is
				the most fiscal and social conservative one.</p>

				In the same period, for 273 legislators and 752 votes in the Senate, the Correct

<p>A <em>t-test</em> was run with the null hypothesis being that there was no
				increase in the "extremeness" in the legislators' behavior in the Senate compared to
				the House. The increase in the polarity was found to be statistically significant
				with a 95% level for PSDB and PFL-DEM, with a 90% level for PT, and statistically
				insignificant for PMDB. This statistical analysis therefore presents evidence that
				legislators in the Senate are more polarized than in the House, and therefore
				hypotheses 01 and 02 are not falsified by these results. These results become
				blurred, however, when parties are disaggregated by legislature and also when
				studying the coalitions instead of parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7742992"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Time series for parties</p>
<p>The effect of each separate party in each legislature is explored below. There were
				six legislatures in the period studied, two chambers, and the categorization
				party/coalition. Hence, there are 24 sets of estimates. In practically all of them,
				the Correct Classification is around 90%, the APRE is 0.6 and the GMP is 0.75. The
				exception is with the Senate, where the APRE for the years 1991–1994 is around
				0.2.</p>
<p>Figures 03 to 06 display the behavior of each party separately, in the House and in
				the Senate. They cover all the legislatures since redemocratization, excluding the
				two most recent ones<sup><a href="#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a></sup>. The
				previous result remains unequivocal to the behavior of legislators from PT only. In
				every legislature, the senators from PT were more polarized than their colleagues in
				the House, <em>i.e.</em>, the PT's coordinates in the Senate are to the left
				of the PT's coordinates in the House<sup><a href="#fn18"><sup>18</sup></a></sup>. The hypothesis is verified for PSDB in the first three
				legislatures only, and fails for the last three. PFL's behavior was in accordance
				with the expectations in the periods 1989–1990 and 1999–2002 only. Finally, PMDB
				demonstrated more polarized behavior in the Senate in 1995–1998, 2003–2006, and
				2007–2010.</p>
<p>As a simple measure of success of this hypothesis, the instances where the
				polarization was as expected were counted and divided by the opportunities to be as
				expected, <em>i.e.</em>, the number of times a party behaved as it "should"
				was added and divided by the total number of possible times a party could have
				behaved as it "should". Consequently, out of 23 opportunities to corroborate the
				claim, 13 successes were observed; a 56% rate of success. Separating this by
				parties' orientations, the right-wing parties had 14 opportunities and the
				polarization in the Senate was higher in only four instances. It is noteworthy
				though, that for the left-wing parties, the behavior was in accordance with the
				hypothesis in all nine opportunities. This may indicate that there is a
				heterogeneous treatment effect that influences the legislator's behavior more
				strongly when he is a member of a left-wing party.</p>

<a name="idp7763408"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Aggregated effects for coalitions</p>
<p>Although a presidentialism, Brazil presented so far somewhat parliamentary dynamics
				in the Congress. Given the multiparty system, the presidents had to gather votes in
				Congress beyond their own parties in order to pass their legislative agendas. Hence,
				every government had to form a coalition; one can then separate the legislators as
				in a two-party system.</p>
<p>The coalitions were recorded in the data set as government and opposition, and not as
				the left and right <em>per se</em>. However, one can use the ideological
				orientation of the president to label each coalition. As shown in <sup><a href="#B11">Leoni (2002)</a></sup>, the first three presidents since
				the comeback of direct elections; Fernando Collor, Itamar Franco and Fernando
				Cardoso had <em>WNOMINATE</em> coordinates to the right in the left-right
				spectrum. The last president in the period studied, Luiz da Silva, was a member of
				the House in 1987–1990, and his <em>WNOMINATE</em> coordinate calculated
				during this period is -0.96. The president during the democratic transition was José
				Sarney, who then became a senator, and his first coordinate in the period 1991–1994
				is 0.15. Hence, the first three government coalitions, covering the 1989–2002
				period, were classified as right-wing coalitions, and the last two, covering the
				2003–2010 period, were classified as left-wing ones<sup><a href="#fn19"><sup>19</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>First, the estimation used all the coalitions in the period studied,
					<em>i.e.</em>, not separated by legislature. The
					<em>WNOMINATE</em> single-dimension linear model applied to the House
				presented a Correct Classification of 89%, an Aggregate Proportional Reduction in
				Error of 0.55 and a Geometric Mean Probability of 0.76. For the Senate the
				respective values are 91%, 0.60, and 0.79.</p>
<p><a href="#t2">Table 02</a> shows that the right-wing coalitions
				are more polarized in the Senate than in the House, according with hypothesis 03,
				but hypothesis 04 is not confirmed, <em>i.e.</em>, left-wing coalitions are
				not more polarized in the Senate than in the House. The <em>t-test</em>
				states that the difference in the polarization is statistically significant at the
				95% level in the right-wing case, and at 90% level for the left-wing coalitions.
				Interestingly, the broad result is somewhat inverted when the estimations were run
				with disaggregated legislatures.</p>

<a name="idp7824160"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Conclusion and future research</p>
<p>Political polarization is an important issue in American and European politics, and
				has been under scholarly investigation for some time now. It also appears to be an
				increasingly important feature of Brazilian politics, one that is talked about in
				journalistic accounts and informal chats but yet to receive much attention in
				academia. This paper investigates whether electoral rules affect polarization in the
				Brazilian legislative branch. Specifically, I compare the plurality-majority rule
				used in the Senate with the proportional rule used in the House of
				Representatives.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that the plurality-majority rule induces more polarization is
				supported by data, but not to its full extent. In the comprehensive test, using the
				aggregate data for almost all legislatures in the democratic period, the Senate
				treatment had a positive effect in causing its legislators to behave more extremely.
				This claim is not as apparent as when the data by legislature and coalition are
				separated. In general, left-wing parties and coalitions are more affected by the
				treatment than their right-wing counterparts.</p>
<p>Comparing the comprehensive treatment effects of the aggregated cases with the
				heterogeneous ones in the legislature-by-legislature instances is difficult because
				of software specificities. The particular issue lies in fixing fiscal and social
				conservative legislators in the complete data set in order to determine the polarity
				result in different coordinate estimates from the estimates in the disaggregated
				data sets. This occurs because the particular legislators chosen in the first case
				are not in every legislature, forcing other choices.</p>
<p>This problem of the same party or member of the Congress in different legislatures
				may be resolved in a dynamic estimation, for example, using
					<em>DW-NOMINATE</em> and a common space for the legislatures. Also with
				dynamic methods, and using the fact that some members of the House eventually became
				members of the Senate, this experiment could be performed in order to compare
				directly, <em>i.e.</em>, in the same person, the effect of the control and
				treatment. Again, this would require the assignment of a common space, but for both
				chambers. Finally, one can extend the analysis for all of the parties, to explore
				whether there is a similar effect of the electoral rules on polarization for the
				small parties in the Congress.</p>
<p>As a last note, I do not make any judgment of value here regarding political
				polarization. It may be sometimes good or sometimes bad. I use the terms found in
				the literature. Hence, one should not think that words like <em>extremists,
					moderates</em>, and <em>polarized</em> have any value hierarchy in
				this paper. They might have in some of the studies mentioned, but not in this paper.
				The analysis in this paper is mostly descriptive, and somewhat inferential. There is
				no attempt to recommend any particular institutional design.</p>

<a name="fn6"></a><p><sup>6</sup> When there are two Senate seats in dispute we must call it a two-member

<a name="fn7"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn7"></a><p><sup>7</sup> In Brazil the system is that of an open list, in which the voter votes for the
					party, but can also vote for a particular candidate on the list, determining
					then the final ordering. The other proportional rule system is that of a closed
					list, in which the party orders the candidates and the voter cannot cast a vote
					for a particular member of that list; more precisely, the voter does not
					influence the final ordering.</p>

</div>
<a name="fn9"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn9"></a><p><sup>9</sup> Although somewhat proportional, seats per state are limited from below by eight,
					and limited from above by 70. By way of example, Roraima, a low-populated state,
					counted in 2002 with roughly 208,000 voters and eight seats, while São Paulo,
					the most populous one, counted with roughly 26 million voters and only 70 seats.
					If São Paulo were to have the same proportion of seats as Roraima did, it would
					have had 984 seats. This distortion is not immediately relevant for
					policy-making though. The legislative behavior is, for the most part, partisan,
					and not divided statewise. Representatives vote partywise more often than
					statewise, even if the policy is not beneficial to its state. These results can
					be found in <sup><a href="#B16">Mignozzetti, Bernabel and Gaudino
						(2011)</a></sup>. In this work a Monte Carlo simulation was run using
						<em>WNOMINATE</em> estimates, where the representational proportions
					were corrected and the new seats were filled with the proportions each party had
					previously. The malaportionment might affect policy-making but the effect is
					mediated by a correlation between state and popular vote for the parties.</p>
</div>
<a name="fn10"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn10"></a><p><sup>10</sup> This cost/benefit relation is then blurred because the problem is pushed to an
					individual level and not the aggregated one. Such a micro-causation reasoning
					will remain black-boxed in this study because we are more interested in the
					aggregated effect of electoral rules <em>per se</em>, and not in
					individual evaluations of office and policy. What matters for the present study
					is that different rules select different behavior. One can also estimate an
					expected utility function to test the hypothesis that the seats in the Senate
					are more attractive. A possible model to start with could take the senator's
					eight-year salary and multiply it by the probability of being nominated to run
					for the office and the probability of winning the election, all this multiplied
					by the party's expectation of loyalty and, finally, multiplied by the inverse of
					the ideological distance between the prospective candidate and the party. For
					the expected utility of a House seat, one could take the four-year salary of a
					representative and multiply it by the probability of securing nomination by the
					party and the probability of being elected, all this multiplied by the party's
					expectation of loyalty and, finally, multiplied by the inverse of the
					ideological distance between the prospective candidate and the party. It is not
					within the scope of this work to run this estimation.</p>

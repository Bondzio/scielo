After reviewing main structural transformations leading to increased female economic activity, the paper examines the diversity of female work trajectories in a selected group of urban married women with children, born between 1940 and 1970. Analysis is based on their life histories and takes as its object of inquiry the influence of two central family transitions (marriage and birth of children) in the relative discontinuity of female work trajectories. Discussion suggests a differential influence of such transitions in the discontinuity of work trajectories by social sector, observed in the duration of work interruptions. Sociocultural, demographic and economic factors are used to explain such differences.

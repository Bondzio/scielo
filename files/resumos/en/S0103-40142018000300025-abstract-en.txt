ABSTRACT Biology may be one of the most interesting or boring school subjects for students depending on how it is approached. Articulating aspects of the constructivist consensus with the dimensions of Scientific Literacy, this article intends to show the potential of inquiry-based science learning in Biology teaching to make it more meaningful to students. The didactic sequences of inquiry-based learning can broaden the goals of Biology teaching from the perspective of Scientific Literacy, allowing students to be placed at the center of the teaching and learning process to develop their understanding of concepts and theories, of the process of knowledge production and of the relationship between science, technology, society and the environment.

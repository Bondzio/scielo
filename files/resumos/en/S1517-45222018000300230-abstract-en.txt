Abstract In this article, I examine the migrations of the plastic artist Lasar Segall (1889-1957). In my view, this constitutes a paradigmatic case for the study of migrations of artists both for the imprints left by the migration experiences on his painting, and for the prominence attributed to them by the critical reception of his work. In this exercise, I consider the specificities of the artist's migrations within a broader context of migration flows contemporary with his own. In fact, Segall's busiest period, from 1906 to 1932, between travels and migrations, was also marked by large intra-European and transatlantic migration flows. Finally, some related themes will also be treated, such as nationalism, xenophobia and racism, cosmopolitanism, exoticism, transnationalism and exile.

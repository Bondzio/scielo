This article intends to provide a typology of the families that are settled in the region of Andradina (Sao Paulo state), according to the main production and commercialization systems and to the presence (or not) of agricultural income diversification. The empiric data used to form the groups originate from socioeconomic questionnaires that had been applied to 169 families of eight rural settlements and also from 80 interviews. The groups were compared with each other, starting from the family´s profile; patrimony; credit and technical support; self-consumption production; and the lot´s external income. The strategy to increase the production and the productivity (dairy cattle) is limited to less than a quarter of the producers, however different strategies had been used by families, such as the diversification of the agricultural income and the direct sale to the consumer or to the retail trade. The association of the production diversification with the use, in a regular way, of differentiated channels of commercialization demonstrated a strategy capable to approximate the indicators of this type of producer comparing with those that focused on increasing the production and the productivity. This verification is important because, even though there is no necessary contradiction among both strategies, a part of the families does not have resources, infrastructure and/or technical qualification to follow the way of the productive intensification and others do not have this project as a priority.

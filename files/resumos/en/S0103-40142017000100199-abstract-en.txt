Abstract Given the environmental complexity characteristic of the city of SÃ£o Paulo and its environs, the problems and conflicts deriving from use and occupation of space and generating new dilemmas, inequities and inequalities, how does one face the complex and chaotic issues in light of the current knowledge paradigm? How does one place oneself before a scenario of environmental degradation? How does one think about the development of environmentally effective and socially just public policies? This paper discusses a proposal of environmental governance that promotes environmental, heritage conservation and local sustainability by considering the relationships between different types of knowledge through dialogue and participation. Studies carried out at the Ciclo de Ouro Geopark in Guarulhos (SP) show that there are alternatives to the governance of complex systems in face if contemporary urban environmental dilemmas. The Geopark as model for the environmental management and governance contributes to preservation and generation of ecosystem services with direct implications to the site and, consequently, to its surroundings.

Martin Jay (1986) and John Rajchman (1988) have written essays about the space of vision and of the visual in Foucault's philosophical work. Although the theme is the same the author's perspectives are very different. Thus, concernig these two essays, the purpose of this article is to circumscribe another vision about the empire of the gaze and the art of seeing in Foucault's writings. The relationship between vision and thought is considered under the perspective of problematizations.

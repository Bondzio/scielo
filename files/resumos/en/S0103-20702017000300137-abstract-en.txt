Abstract This article discusses three bases for political elites&#8217; multinatobilization (family, militant and professional, production of symbolic goods) and how they translate into usable trumps in Brazilian political struggles. From an analytical and empirical reflection, we propose that the apprehension of its multiple dimensions and the intersections between domains and practices may lead to an extensive and intensive investigation of political functioning principles, selection and hierarchization, of the agents&#8217; conditioning and logics, as well as of the legitimacy processes that affect the composition of these representation professionals.

Abstract: The social representations that teachers have about sexual diversity influence the construction and deconstruction of prejudice at school. Thus, this qualitative study aimed to analyze the social representations of middle and high school teachers about sexual diversity and homophobia. For this, we used the thematic content analysis method. The results showed that teachers&#8217; representations are based on social patterns about sexual diversity, which generate subtle prejudices and contribute to homophobia in school. Therefore, there is need for valuable information on these issues, enabling teachers to promote pedagogical actions that contribute to recognition of sexual diversity.

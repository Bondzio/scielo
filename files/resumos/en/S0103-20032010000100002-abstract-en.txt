This work presents main results of how inhabitants of Alto Para√≠so de Goias are seeking alternatives to sustainable development through the implantation, by Embrapa, of a project about the rescue of coffee. Mining and farming activities were developed in the region until its main activity turned into tourism in 1960, with the creation of the National Park of the Chapada dos Veadeiros, and inauguration of Brasilia. In 2000, flow of tourists dropped due to problems related to public health, resulting in the stagnation of local economy. Over the last years, family producers woken up for the existence of a coffee that can be sold in niche markets for special coffees - organic and from defined origins - and counted on Embrapa to develop the research project. The study revealed that by unveiling values - history, culture and traditions -, it is possible to establish more efficient strategy for search in the market, from revealed experience in concrete job and producers culture. In addition, it revealed that rural development in that region must be sought through the development of activities of the new rurality and the implementation of a territorial approach.

In 2014, the Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;) completed two decades. The Convention is the basis of the Brazilian Law 11.340 (Maria da Penha's Law) and remains the central reference for understanding the social and legal dimensions of its effectiveness. In celebration of these 20 years, it is possible to see a more precise comprehension of the Convention and its deployments achieved by the initiatives of signatory States. The refinement of its terms and principles will influence laws and measures adopted within national sovereignty. Therefore, this paper develops a reflection on the Convention and its current importance to combating violence against women in Brazil, indicating the way forward to the scope of Maria da Penha's Law

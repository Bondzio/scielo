ABSTRACT The following article discusses the social representations present in the judicial system in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires (MABA) in terms of the human rights of the international migrants to have arrived in Argentina as of the mid twentieth century. By means of a qualitative study encompassing fifty in-depth interviews held with members of the MABA judicial system, exclusionary discourse emerged running against the universalist perspective that respects migrants&#8217; rights. Upon further study of the results gathered, three lines of analysis are discussed: desired migration policies, competition between locals and migrants in accessing economic and social rights, and, finally, the concept of restricted citizenship.

This is a survey study involving the analysis of the 36 journals that comprise the Educ@ repository of publications focused on distance education - DE - and information and comunication technologies - ICTs. The three journals that deal exclusively with the dissemination of topics related to this survey study were excluded, leaving 824 articles to be analyzed. The tabulated data allowed identification of a change in the focus of the studies, which dealt with educational computing and started to investigate the use / appropriation of ICTs, and teacher training for and through distance education. From 2008 the number of articles published per year in each periodical tripled, signaling increased interest of researchers to investigate these issues.

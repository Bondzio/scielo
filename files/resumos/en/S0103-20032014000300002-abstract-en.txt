Certified coffee production is an opportunity for the grower to differ his product. However, the number of certified producers is still relatively small. In order to contribute to the dissemination of accreditation among farmers, the objective of this study is to identify the factors that determine its adoption, based on a sample of certified and non-certified growers from the south of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Quantitative data were analyzed through logistic regression. Results showed that five variables were significant in explaining the certification adoption: grower's age; role of coffee in family income; attending courses and events; computer use in the farm and crop yield. These results expand the existing knowledge about coffee certifications and can guide actions to increase the number of certified producers.

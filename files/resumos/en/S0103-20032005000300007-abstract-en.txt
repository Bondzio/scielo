This paper examines the wage differentials by gender in the poultry industry from South Region of Brazil. The Relação Anual de Informações Sociais - RAIS of 1998 was used. To measure the difference between the homogeneous workers as education and occupation it was used the Oaxaca's method (1973). The results showed that the same discrimination found in the labor markets is present into the poultry industry.

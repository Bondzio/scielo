Abstract Technical change over the twentieth century has been skill-biased. In broad terms, a rise in the relative wage of skilled workers in conjunction with an upward trend in their relative supply was observed in the period. The class structure became more complex; multiple new intermediate positions emerged and inhibited both formation and development of radical distributive conflicts. This paper analyses the effects of these changes in the class structure on the stability of democratic institutions in the world between 1950 and 2003. The risks of democratic breakdown were significantly lower in countries with a deeper degree of population fragmentation in its formal education. In addition, educational fragmentation and product per capita show significant correlation with each other and their effects on democratic stability are substantially identical. These results are in contradiction with the literature has indicated that GDP effects on democratic stability are independent and stronger than the effects of any other variable. Theories of distributive conflict, which have received recent heavy criticism, must be reconsidered and revalued in light of these results.

Abstract: This article analyzes some representations of Brazilians on their educational processes (reviews and memories about school and teachers) and their relationships with the objectification of these differentiated representations in school trajectories (schooling levels of respondents). We describe the classical variables - age, sex and social background - of household heads and spouses members of our sample that is representative of the population. The school was characterized as an intervening factor in the social trajectory through three evaluations of individual experience: the school, the teacher and the position among colleagues. We analyzed the weight of these school experiences in determining the different levels of educational attainment in relation to the weight of family or social origin. In the Brazilian context, social origin strongly determines the school trajectories. The school still has not been able to substantially reduce the impact of social background on the students&#8217; trajectories.

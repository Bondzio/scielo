Among the Brazilian writers of 19th century that registered their travels in books, Nísia Floresta Brasileira Augusta can be highlighted. She was born in 1810 in the countryside of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, and lived in Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Sul and Rio de Janeiro before moving to Europe in 1849. There, she visited several countries until she passed away in 1885, in Rouen, France. Among the fifteen titles she published " including novels, romances, short stories, poems, and essays written in Portuguese, French, and Italian, are the interesting Itinéraire d'un voyage en Allemagne (Paris, 1857), and Trois ans en Italie, suivis d'un voyage en Gréce (Paris, I vol. 1864; II vol. 1871). These books, written in the form of diary or letters, are more than simple reports, since they reveal, according to the taste of that time, the emotions and impressions of the author concerning every city or country that she visited, as well as sensitive descriptions and reflections of churches, museums, monuments, and human types.

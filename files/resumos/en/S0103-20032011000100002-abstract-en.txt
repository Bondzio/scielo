The objective of this study is to analyze the determinants of chicken meat export supply in the period from 1992 to 2007, when the industry acquired more representativeness in the Brazilian shipments. The theoretical approach is based on the ratios between supply and demand. The econometric model is based on the Johansen' procedure and the Error Correction Vector (VEC). Results show that the Brazilian price and the domestic income have significant impact on the Brazilian chicken meat exports, leading to a negative effect on the shipped volume. The international price presents significant and positive impacts on the amount exported.

<p>The aim of this article is to investigate the institutionalisation of the state
					Public Defender's Offices before and after the reform that granted independence
					and new functions to the Public Defender's Offices in Brazil. We attempt to
					understand these processes based on theories of judicial empowerment (ideational
					and governance perspectives), analyse them in the Brazilian states by means of
					an analysis of two indicators in three different time periods (before, during
					and after the reform) and verify to what extent the formal (de jure) advances
					were involved in the exercise of autonomy in the states. The analysis reveals
					that in spite of the formal achievement of independence, the majority of state
					Public Defender's Offices are not actually independent and there is a great gap
					between what the laws stipulate and what actually happens in the public
					provision of access to justice in Brazil.</p>

<p>The aim of this article is to investigate the institutionalisation of the state
				Public Defender's Offices before and after the reform that granted independence and
				new functions to the Public Defender's Offices in Brazil. This reform, created by
				the 1988 Federal Constitution with the aim of guaranteeing access to justice to the
				less privileged groups in Brazilian society with the public provision of legal
				assistance, took over two decades to be implemented by the states in their
				institutions. After a slow process of institutionalisation, it underwent a great
				change with the enactment of Constitutional Amendment nº45 in 2004, which, in the
				context of the reform of the Judiciary Branch, granted independence and new
				attributions to the Brazilian Public Defender's Office. The PDO is today an
				institution of great power and visibility in the legal system. However, considerable
				differences exist between the states in terms of their independence.</p>
<p>As a research problem, we initially sought to understand the reform and the
				attainment of independence based on theories of judicial empowerment – whether
				through ideational perspectives, which suggest that the Public Defender's Office was
				reformed as part of a general movement towards democratisation and guaranteeing
				access to rights in Latin America, or from governance perspectives, which indicate
				the attempt by the Executive Branch to modernise public assistance in Brazil,
				reducing differences between the states. We also sought to understand the movement
				of institutionalisation and independence of the Brazilian state Public Defender's
				Offices, verifying to what extent formal (<em>de jure</em>) advances were
				connected to the exercise of autonomy in the states.</p>
<p>There are three reasons for studying the Brazilian Public Defender's Office. Firstly,
				Brazil is one of the few countries in Latin America that has a constitutional
				institution with public servants providing legal assistance to vulnerable
					citizens<sup><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>. Secondly, given
				income inequality in Brazil, almost 90% of the population qualifies for free legal
				assistance, the criterion being earning up to three minimum wages (IBGE, 2010).
				Thirdly, the Public Defender's Office is a young institution, with great relevance
				as a political actor, and whose relationship with the other justice bodies must be
				better researched.</p>
<p>This article is inscribed in the domain of comparative judicial studies, which
				through the lens of political science has carried out a series of investigations on
				the role of different legal and judicial institutions in Latin America, particularly
				on their role as providers of social justice and on the relationship between legal
				processes and politics (<sup><a href="#B49">TAYLOR, 2008</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Specifically in Brazil, since the mid-1990s, this research field has been discussing
				the role of the interaction of judicial processes with the democratic political
				system, whether in terms of the debate on the separation between the spheres of
				government and the judicialisation of politics, or through the effects in terms of
				the formulation and implementation of public policies (<sup><a href="#B18">CASTRO, 1997</a></sup>). In institutional terms, the first Brazilian
				studies on the justice system focused on the Judiciary and its various aspects, such
				as the role of the Constitutional Court in its relationship with the political
				system, especially the impacts of injunctions issued against the actions of the
				Executive and Legislative Branches (<sup><a href="#B18">CASTRO,
					1997</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B50">VIANNA et al. 1999</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B51">2007</a></sup>); the process of recruitment of the
				Brazilian judicature (<sup><a href="#B50">VIANNA et al., 1999</a></sup>);
				and the discussions on the Judicial Branch and the changes and reforms undergone
				since the country's redemocratisation (<sup><a href="#B44">SADEK,
					1999</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B45">2004</a></sup>). More recently,
				several studies have been dedicated to investigating the State Prosecutor's Office
				and its institutional changes, its role in defending diffuse and collective rights
				and the vision and activism of its members (<sup><a href="#B7">ARANTES,
					1999)</a></sup>; and its role as a political actor and the processes of achieving
				autonomy and accountability (<sup><a href="#B16">CARVALHO and LEITÃO,
					2010</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B17">FORTHCOMING</a></sup>). However, there
				is still a great scarcity of work dedicated to investigating the other bodies that
				make up the justice system, the other courts and the relationship of these
				institutions with the processes of judicialisation and increasing access to justice
				in the country. Another aspect that has not yet been much explored in Brazil is the
				role of the Judicial Branch regarding public policies (<sup><a href="#B49">TAYLOR, 2008)</a></sup> and the role of actors such as the State
				Prosecutor's Office and public defenders in the process of implementing public
				policies.</p>
<p>In order to understand the context of the reform, we use the concepts of
				institutional and judicial independence (<sup><a href="#B1">AGUIAR,
					FORTHCOMING</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B16">CARVALHO and LEITÃO,
					2010</a></sup>, FORTHCOMING; <sup><a href="#B42">RÍOS-FIGUEROA and
					STATON, 2009</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B43">2011</a></sup>) and the
				theoretical discussion on judicial empowerment (<sup><a href="#B22">FINKEL, 2005</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B23">HILBINK, 2009</a></sup>;
				HILBINK and WODS, 2009; <sup><a href="#B25">HIRSCHL, 2000</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B28">INGRAM, 2012</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B39">NUNES, 2010a</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B40">2010b</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B52">WHITTINGTON AND DEVINS, 2005</a></sup>). The research was
				carried out based on an analysis of qualitative and quantitative sources. The
				qualitative sources included documents and legislation, as well as observations and
				interviews with public defenders. The quantitative data was obtained mainly from the
					<em>Diagnósticos da Defensoria Pública no Brasil</em> [Diagnostics of
				the Public Defender's Offices in Brazil] (<sup><a href="#B33">MINISTÉRIO
					DA JUSTIÇA, 2004</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B34">2006</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B35">2009</a></sup>). This data, along with demographic data,
				was analysed using software package SPSS, which enabled indexes to be

<p>This article is organised in three sections. Following this introduction, the second
				section deals with the history of the Public Defender's Office in Brazil in the
				context of democratic institutions in Latin America. It presents a theoretical
				discussion on independence and judicial autonomy and discusses the reform,
				especially from the public defender's point of view. The third section presents an
				analysis of the processes of institutionalisation and independence in the Brazilian
				states by analysing two indicators. The final section is the conclusion.</p>

<a name="idp7774912"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The Brazilian public defender's offices: historical and comparative
				perspectives</p>
<p>In the Brazilian judicial system, there are bodies that function at a federal level
				and at state level. At the federal level, the Judiciary Branch includes the
				following units: the Federal Courts (courts of general jurisdiction) – including the
				federal small claims courts – and the courts of special jurisdiction – composed of
				the Labour Courts, Electoral Courts and Military Courts. The organisation of the
				state Courts, which includes small civil and criminal claims courts, is an
				attribution of each one of Brazil's states and the Federal District. The state
				Public Defender's Offices operate within the State Courts and the federal Public
				Defender's Office operates in the context of the Federal Courts. Article 5 of the
				1988 Federal Constitution lists individual rights and the role of public defenders
				in guaranteeing access to justice. The Public Defender's Office is governed by
				Complementary Law nº 80 of 1994, which establishes rules for how it is organised in
				the states. This law was altered by Complementary Law nº 132 of 2009, which
				regulates the alterations resulting from Constitutional Amendment nº 45 of 2004,
				which guaranteed the independence of the state Public Defender's Offices.</p>
<p>The Federal Constitution of 1988 prescribes full legal assistance to those in need of
				it (art. 5 LXXIV) and also raises the status of the Public Defender's Office to that
				of institution essential to the exercise of the jurisdictional function of the
				State, which is responsible for legal advice and defence at all levels of need (art.
				134). With the return to democracy, the Federal Constitution assigned to the Public
				Defender's Office the role of guarantor of access to justice for all the
				population.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7780320"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Historical perspective</p>
<p>In the process of the access to justice in Brazil being increased<sup><a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a></sup>, the expansion of the Judicial Branch took place
				in three waves.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first wave of expansion of Brazil's Judicial Branch, which happened between
					1930 and 1940, was propelled by a deeper, more lasting trend in Brazilian
					politics – one of mistrust of political representative institutions and of the
					democratic regime’s capacity to meet society’s needs (<sup><a href="#B8">ARANTES, 2007, p</a></sup>, p. 104).</p></blockquote>
<p>The second one, from the 1970s, saw the responsibility for the defence of diffuse and
				collective interests before the Judicial Branch be attributed to the State
				Prosecutor's Office, as a body of the State. The third saw the 1988 Constitution
				consolidate itself as an instrument for carrying out social justice and promoting
				rights, incorporating values of social, economic and cultural equality at the same
				time as it consolidated the expansion of the justice system for protecting
				collective rights, and also increasing access to justice, especially through
				innovations in the judicial structure.</p>
<p>The first signs of the Public Defender's Office in Brazil appeared in the context of
				the dictatorship, but it developed systematically only after the 1988 Constitution
				was promulgated, when democracy returned to Brazil and to other Latin American
				countries. From this phase onwards, the Public Defender's Office started being
				considered vital as a guarantor of rights and for ensuring access to justice.</p>
<p>Currently, the Public Defender's Office is established by law as permanent and
				essential to the State's jurisdictional function and as an instrument for democracy,
				responsible not only for offering legal assistance and free defence to those who
				need it, but also for the individual and collective promotion and defence of rights
				at all judicial and extrajudicial levels. The institutional principles of unity,
				indivisibility and functional independence are guaranteed by law. Additionally,
				certain objectives establish the work of the Public Defender's Office as an
				instrument of democracy, such as the primacy of the dignity of man, reduction of
				inequalities, the affirmation of the Democratic Rule of Law and the effective
				guarantee of human rights and of the constitutional principles of legal defence.
				These new functions were added by article 4 of Complementary Law 132.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, the Public Defender's Office has been the object of analysis of few
				but very important studies in the social sciences. The studies in question concern
				the trajectory, the profile of the defenders and the effectiveness of guaranteeing
				access to justice of the Rio de Janeiro PDO, the first one to be institutionalised
				in the country (<sup><a href="#B3">ALBERTI, 1996</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B19">COSTA, 2000</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B36">MOTTA, 2007, 20</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B37">2009</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B38">MOTTA and RIBEIRO, 2007</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B46">SANTOS, 2013)</a></sup>. The recent institutionalisation and its
				difficulties are portrayed in studies on the PDOs of the states of São Paulo (<sup><a href="#B5">ALMEIDA, 2005)</a></sup> and Paraná (<sup><a href="#B47">SANTOS and CARON, 2013)</a></sup>. Other studies attempt to understand
				the Brazilian experience by means of a comparative view (<sup><a href="#B6">ALVES, 2005)</a></sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7878784"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Institutional independence</p>
<p>Currently, the state Public Defender's Offices have greater independence than the
				federal government's Public Defender's Office. Article 6 of the Federal Constitution
				prescribes that the Brazilian President must choose the federal Chief Public
				Defender and article 99 prescribes that the choice of state Chief Public Defenders
				must be made by the state governors. These choices are made from a list of civil
				servants whose names are chosen by the board of the public defender's office by
				secret ballot.</p>
<p>With Constitutional Amendment nº 45 of 2004, the federal Public Defender's Office
				came to have its own council, and councils were also created at state level. These
				councils are meant to be the highest normative and decision-making bodies of their
				institutions.</p>
<p>Regarding career security, public defenders – like judges and prosecutors – are
				functionally independent in their roles, including in their terms of office, and
				there is no possibility of salary reduction. The law that governs the Public
				Defender's Office provides for competition in the filling of posts, sets out the
				makeup of the board and established the institution's functional and administrative
				independence. Given these legal guarantees, the aim of this study is to understand
				the institutional changes, especially after the creation of these formal guarantees,
				and their consequences for the Brazilian states. Concepts and theories on the
				independence of legal institutions will help us understand the reform in the context
				of Latin America's return to democracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7883856"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Comparative perspective</p>
<p>The debate on judicial reform in Latin America has focused on a number of targets,
				including the quest for justice, for quicker, more efficient and predictable trials,
				an external control of the Judicial Branch, the adoption of alternative conflict
				resolution mechanisms and control of the lower courts by the higher courts. These
				goals follow the orientation of several international bodies, including the World
				Bank.</p>
<p>Access to justice is provided in the whole world by three systems<sup><a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></sup>. The first one is the "honour system", in which
				lawyers are obliged to represent poor clients without being paid. The second one is
				the "bureaucratic system", in which state agencies and public attorneys provide
				legal services for poor people. This model is characteristic of Latin America, where
				the creation of Public Defender's Offices has been the rule in the last few years.
				In the third system, characteristic of European countries, legal services are
				provided by bar associations or by independent associations of private attorneys
					(<sup><a href="#B48">SMULOVITZ, FORTHCOMING</a></sup>, p. 07).</p>
<p>The Public Defender's Offices in Latin America were structured in the 1990s and
				2000s. They were created with the aim of guaranteeing access to justice with
				assistance, representation and adequate defence, and guaranteeing the rights of
				those in need. Some PDOs are limited to the penal area (in Bolivia, Chile and
				Argentina, for example) but in other countries legal assistance is given in both
				criminal and civil questions (Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama and Uruguay, for
				example). The Inter-American Association of Public Defenders (<sup><a href="#B2">AIDEF – Associação Interamericana de Defensorias Públicas</a></sup>) was
				created in 2003 to establish a permanent system of coordination between the Public
				Defender's Offices in the Americas and the Caribbean. The aim of this association is
				to defend human rights, promote the independent functioning of PDOs and to
				strengthen it in relation to the State Prosecutor's Office.</p>
<p>Countries with a federative structure such as Brazil, Argentina and Mexico developed
				different legal structures for their federal and state courts. In Brazil, the state
				Public Offices of the Defender, which are the focus of this article, were created
				mainly between 1990 and 2000. They are more independent than the federal Public
				Defender's Office, created in 2004 and bound to the Executive Branch, and its fight
				for independence is currently following the legal channels in the National
				Congress.</p>
<p>In Mexico, the Public Defender's Office was created in 1998, "to guarantee the right
				to defence in civil, administrative and tax issues and in criminal cases" (<sup><a href="#B27">IFDP, 2012</a></sup>). One example of a state Public
				Defender’s Office is the <em>Instituto Veracruzano</em>, created in 2006.
				This institution has the additional responsibility of dealing with indigenous, young
				people, and gender issues. The Mexican Public Defender's Offices are only
				technically and operationally independent. The federal public defenders are civil
				servants who work for the Judicial Branch and the state Public Defender's Offices
				are government agencies.</p>
<p>In Argentina, access to justice is guaranteed by the <em>Ministerio Público de
					Defensa de la Nación</em>, a federal institution that became independent in
				1994 with a constitutional reform. In the provinces, "provision of public defence in
				Argentina is currently regulated by 25 different laws. Each provincial unit has its
				own law” (<sup><a href="#B48">SMULOVITZ, FORTHCOMING</a></sup>, p. 09). In
				terms of independence, over 90% of defenders in the provinces are linked to the
				Judicial Branch.</p>
<p>The three countries are similar in their differentiation between the federal and
				state Public Defender's Offices. The difference between them is their degree of
				independence and the provision of access to services of a non-penal nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7899008"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Judicial independence and autonomy</p>
<p>Independent judicial institutions have the capacity to promote and maintain human
				wellbeing, stabilise democratic regimes and protect human rights (<sup><a href="#B42">RÍOS-FIGUEROA and STATON, 2009</a></sup>). As a rule,
				they are part of an institutional dimension related to preventing arbitrariness by
				governments, an individual dimension related to correcting discriminatory practices
				in law enforcement and a social dimension related to social stability (<sup><a href="#B43">RÍOS-FIGUEROA and STATON, 2011</a></sup>). Studies show
				that these are the roles of the courts in helping to consolidate democratic
				regimes.</p>
<p>There is a difference between judicial independence and judicial power or between
				judicial independence <em>de facto </em>and<em> de jure</em>. <sup><a href="#B21">Feld and Voigt (2007</a></sup>, p. 02) define <em>de
					jure </em>independence as "the independence of courts as it can be deduced
				from legal documents" and <em>de facto</em> independence as "the degree of
				independence that the courts factually enjoy."</p>
<p>Judicial independence "demands that judges do not suffer any interference that makes
				them unable to judge cases. Therefore, it is not a sufficient condition for a Rule
				of Law, but it is a necessary condition" (<sup><a href="#B32">LEIRAS et
					al., FORTHCOMING</a></sup>, p. 06). It means having the freedom to decide on
				certain cases without restrictions imposed by other political actors. The judicial
				sphere also demands political accountability, as judicial independence alone is not
				sufficient without the power to impose decisions. The independence of other actors
				depends on legal provisions that establish the relationship between judges and other
				branches of government, and whether politicians are acting in accordance with the
				legal provisions (<sup><a href="#B42">RÍOS-FIGUEROA and STATON,
					2009</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The debate on the relationship between judicial independence and judicial power can
				be useful for understanding to what extent gaining formal independence can be a
				source of empowerment for a judicial institution.</p>
<p>The independence of the Public Defender's Office is a way in which to formally
				capacitate the Judicial Branch. Why did Brazil do this? There are several theories
				aimed at explaining judicial strengthening or empowerment, that is, the granting by
				the Executive and Legislative Branches of part of their power to the Judicial
				Branch. The most prominent theories are insurance theory (<sup><a href="#B22">FINKEL, 2005</a></sup>), hegemonic preservation theory (<sup><a href="#B25">HIRSCHL, 2000)</a></sup>, the thesis of governance (<sup><a href="#B39">NUNES, 2010a</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B40">2010b</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B52">WHITTINGTON AND DEVINS,
					2005)</a></sup> and the theories of ideational empowerment (<sup><a href="#B28">INGRAM, 2012</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B23">HILBINK,
					2009</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B24">HILBINK and WOODS,
				2009</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Insurance theory presupposes that institutions set the "rules of the game", defining
				the procedures that govern the economic and political behaviour of actors. According
				to this theory, electoral competition determines whether the reforms made for
				judicial empowerment will be implemented. <sup><a href="#B22">Finkel
					(2005)</a></sup> states that:</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] when political players are uncertain about the future division of power,
					even if they currently hold the reins of power, they may seek to increase the
					availability of institutional checks on political authority as a hedge against
					their possible loss of political dominance. Judicial reform thereby becomes a
					trade-off in which ruling parties are willing to accept short-term costs in
					exchange for long-term security (<sup><a href="#B22">FINKEL,
						2005</a></sup>, p.88).</p></blockquote>
<p>The theory of judicial hegemonic preservation argues that empowerment is the result
				of strategies by political and economic elites to preserve their hegemonic influence
				on peripheral groups in the arenas of formulation of majority policies. According to
				this theory, the process of judicial empowerment that takes place by means of the
				constitutionalisation of rights speeds up when hegemonic elites are threatened by
				peripheral groups, as they would rather transfer power over to the courts because
				courts tend to act according to the cultural tendencies of the hegemonic community
					(<sup><a href="#B25">HIRSCHL, 2000</a></sup>, p. 95).</p>
<p>Insurance theory explains judicial empowerment during periods of uncertainty, such as
				transitions to democracy in contexts dominated by traditional elites, when these are
				threatened by the appearance of minority groups. In these situations, "politicians
				empower courts to constrain incoming majorities" (<sup><a href="#B39">NUNES, 2010a</a></sup>, p. 03). However, these theories do not explain the
				institutional reforms proposed in the context of stable electoral competition. It is
				in these contexts that theories of governance gain ground.</p>
<p>Governance theories explain judicial empowerment as a means to facilitate
				presidential agendas and to avoid threats such as federalism, entrenched interests,
				and rebel and pressure coalitions. Using <sup><a href="#B52">Whittington
					and Devins's (2005)</a></sup> theoretical argument, Nunes shows that "a friendly
				judiciary has increased the expected benefits of judicial review for Brazilian
				presidents while lowering the likelihood of judicial vetoes against their
				legislative outputs" (2010a, p. 04). Based on a revision of insurance and rational
				theories, <sup><a href="#B24">Hilbink and Woods (2009)</a></sup> have
				explored ideas as variables in the study of judicial strengthening/empowerment.</p>
<p>Ideational arguments suggest that decisions to build or reform courts are due to
				substantive aims. Decisions are taken according to the need for these changes by the
				countries in question. "This sense of purpose or mission as conditioning factors of
				profoundly rooted ideas is what determines the reactions of actors to the
				limitations of their institutional environment" (<sup><a href="#B40">NUNES, 2010b</a></sup>, p. 41).</p>
<p>Ideational explanations highlight the influence of the immaterial, of ideological
				engagements. Specifically, actors react less to the material, to cost-benefit
				calculations based on rational/strategic interest, and more in response to
				engagements of an immaterial nature, that is, to the roles of courts in society
					(<sup><a href="#B28">INGRAM, 2012</a></sup>, p. 441). Reforms are
				linked to political and ideological postures, especially those to the left in the
				political spectrum. What tends to delegate power to the courts is the belief in
				their very role, that is why "ideas also clarify why actors promote reform despite
				material costs, obstacles, and constraints, even expending great effort over long
				periods of time to overcome those obstacles" (<sup><a href="#B28">INGRAM, 2012</a></sup>, p. 440).</p>
<p>In ideational theory, social movements and interest groups are seen as key actors in
				processes of institutional change. Analysing the process of judicial empowerment in
				Spain during the transition to democracy, <sup><a href="#B23">Hilbink
					(2009</a></sup>, p. 404) describes the role of the lawyers mobilised for promoting
				political liberalism in terms of:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) judicial independence aimed at the moderation of executive power; (2) greater
					autonomy for civil society in the form of free speech, press, associations and
					assembly; and (3) guarantees of basic civil rights, such as bodily integrity,
					due process and equal treatment under law.</p></blockquote>
<p>When analysing the processes of judicial strengthening/empowerment in Brazil,
				insurance theories can help to explain the attainment of independence by the State
				Prosecutor's Office during the transition to democracy (<sup><a href="#B1">AGUIAR, FORTHCOMING</a></sup>). On the other hand, it is possible to
				understand the process of empowerment of the Federal Supreme Court based on the
				governance thesis defended by <sup><a href="#B39">Nunes (2010a</a></sup>,
					<sup><a href="#B40">2010b</a></sup>), which explains the strategy of
				the Executive to grant power to the courts in order to meet its government agenda,
				using the Judicial Branch as a partner. Next, we will see how the attainment of
				independence by the Public Defender's Office can be viewed both from the point of
				view of ideational theories and from theoretical perspectives of governance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7945104"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Independence of the Brazilian public defender's offices</p>
<p>The process of independence and autonomy of the Public Defender's Office in Brazil,
				achieved through constitutional and legislative changes, must be understood in terms
				of Brazil's transition to democracy. This transition took place in a context of
				ample participation by actors and social movements, especially those of lawyers,
				whose role in defending human rights was vital to establishing public policies. The
				rise to power of a left-wing political party reflects an increase in concern for
				social justice, equality and vulnerable groups and sectors of the population. The
				attainment of independence by the Public Defender's Offices can therefore be seen as
				part of two larger movements, according to ideational theories and theoretical
				perspectives of governance.</p>
<p>In ideational terms, the possibility of increasing access to justice is part of Latin
				America's democratic political project. All the pressure groups that contributed to
				this project, including national and international actors, are committed to
				democracy and to its consolidation.</p>
<p>Regarding the domestic actors, through the National Association of Public Defenders
				(ANADEP – Associação Nacional dos Defensores Públicos), the political mobilisation
				of the state and federal PDOs showed itself to be a fundamental element for
				realising legislative alterations. Other bodies of members of the justice system
				such as associations of the State Prosecutor's Office and of judges also
				participated. The massive mobilisation of civil society organisations such as NGOs,
				social movements, lawyer networks and the Catholic Church – through the National
				Confederation of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB – Confederação Nacional dos Bispos do
				Brasil) and its pastoral branches, especially the Pastoral Carcerária (Prison
				Pastoral Commission) –revealed the social demand for expanding the activities of
				public defenders.</p>
<p>As for the actions of international actors, international organisations were very
				concerned with institutionalising rights and increasing access to justice. The UN,
				for example, whose report on the independence of judges pointed to a need for
				strengthening the public practice of law in order to guarantee access to justice,
				stood for the adoption of a reform of the justice system as an important – albeit
				insufficient – step, and suggested monitoring the impact of the reform and of
				administrative and financial independence, as well as creating Public Defender's
				Offices in states that did not have any (<sup><a href="#B20">DESPOUY,
					2005</a></sup>).</p>
<p>It is interesting to look at the role performed by the ANADEP alongside the AIDEF in
				strengthening the Public Defender's Offices in all member-countries, using the
				Brazilian experience as an example. This action was incorporated into the
					<em>Regras de Brasília </em>[Rules of Brasília] (2011) and its
				implementation plan. Additionally, international bodies such as the OAS continue to
				encourage increasing access to justice by means of legal assistance, including
				working jointly with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (<sup><a href="#B41">ORGANIZAÇÃO DOS ESTADOS AMERICANOS, 2011)</a></sup>.</p>
<p>From a governance point of view, the process of independence can also be understood
				in the context of a coordinating strategy by federal government, recurrent in
				several other movements of formulation and implementation of public policies. Within
				them, the actions of the federal government, in an attempt to formulate policies
				that are executed by subnational entities, aim to reduce regional differences and
				inequalities (<sup><a href="#B5">ALMEIDA, 2005</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B9">ARRETCHE, 2004</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B10">2010</a></sup>). National legislations tend to give greater uniformity to
				institutional design, aiming at the creation of a single performance standard. The
				Executive Branch showed its support for making the PDO autonomous by authoring the
				legislation aimed at reform. The almost unanimous vote in the Senate also showed the
				endorsement of the Legislative Branch, backed up by the social and electoral appeal
				of expanding access to justice.</p>
<p>We will later see how this objective has not yet been attained in spite of the
				efforts made.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7959648"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The defender's view on the reform and achievement of independence</p>
<p>It could be argued that because of the concession of <em>de jure</em>
				independence, the Brazilian Public Defender's Office saw institutional advances
				towards greater autonomy, visibility and equivalence with the other bodies of the
				justice system. Perhaps in the medium and long term these alterations will change
				the interplay of forces in trials, especially in the criminal system. However, as
				the literature on judicial independence shows, <em>de jure </em>independence
				is necessary but not sufficient for an effective exercise of independence. In the
				next section, we will discuss to what extent achieving formal independence resulted
				in the actual exercise of independence by the state PDOs.</p>
<p>In the defender's view, the Public Defender's Office is the justice system
				institution that most grew in terms of guarantees and structuring in the last
				decade. The reform and attainment of autonomy were the result of external elements
				and an internal mobilisation by the field's professionals. A great window of
				opportunity was provided by the actions of the federal Executive Branch and its
				allied base in the Legislative Branch, which saw the need for the inclusion into the
				justice system of people from classes C and D, whose social mobility took place
				through social programmes of income distribution and the policy of minimum wage
				increase.</p>
<blockquote><p>We achieved this change in Law 132 for two reasons: because of the judicial
					reform – because the Judicial Branch needs the Public Defender's Office, because
					the State needs the Public Defender's Office. In truth, we're in a paradigm of
					inclusion of people from class C and D into the market. You need people to be
					included into the justice system; this is natural from the point of view of the
					organisation of the State. Now, this only happened because the political context
					was favourable for it to happen (<sup><a href="#B30">Interview nº
						10, 2012</a></sup>).</p></blockquote>
<p>After the legal achievement, understood as <em>de jure</em> independence, the
				great difficulty for the state Public Defender's Offices is the implementation of
					<em>de facto</em> independence, which means generating their own
				budgets, setting wages, creating posts and holding competitive civil-service
				examinations. Thus, it is also important to appreciate the defender's view about the
				extent to which the very exercise of functional independence depends on <em>de
					facto </em>independence:</p>
<blockquote><p>It's no use being administratively and functionally independent without budgetary
					independence, so I can know how much I'm going to spend, how many defenders I
					can hire, if I can create another 10 posts for defenders… if I'm stuck to the
					Judicial Branch, I don't have that sort of independence. Because we have
					functional autonomy, I can file a lawsuit against whomever I want and the
					governor can't take me away from here. But he can punish me through the budget
					if I file a civil suit against the state. So to us, this [budgetary autonomy] is
					very important (<sup><a href="#B29">Interview nº 6,
					2012</a></sup>).</p></blockquote>
<p>In the public defender's view, as well as independence, the mobilisation ended up
				resulting in the expansion of the competent jurisdiction of the Public Defender's
				Office. Previously an institution aimed only at individual legal assistance, it also
				came to file class actions and, at a third stage, became a human rights defence
				institution whose model altered the very configuration of the Rule of Law, being
				then copied by other Latin American countries.</p>
<blockquote><p>In terms of advances, if we now talk a bit about Law 132, the Complementary Law
					that altered Law 80 of 1994, which is our Organic Law, what do we have there?
					The article to me is symbolic. It assigns three basic functions to the Public
					Defender's Office – two that we already performed and one new one, which we
					didn’t yet know how to. The first one is integral, free legal orientation –
					which we already did in all contexts – civil, crime, etc; it was nothing new.
					The other one is the protection of collective rights, which is a little bit of a
					novelty, but collective representation was already in the system. And the new
					one, which is the following: to take care of human rights in the Democratic Rule
					of Law, and this is a gigantic incumbency. Why? This, for me, is a big
					turnaround, in the symbolic terms of the Democratic State, a State has
					historically been a State that oppresses, judges and prosecutes – it's very good
					at that. It's very good at judging and prosecuting people, it's a State that now
					offers to defend, and we don't really know how this is going to be done, do we?
					How are we going to create a State that cares, that sees, that understands and
					defends? (<sup><a href="#B30">Interview nº10, 2012</a></sup>).</p></blockquote>
<p>These changes can cause great alteration in the Brazilian criminal system, which is
				still seen as a traditionally inquisitorial model, and which after redemocratisation
				did not reform its legislation to draw closer to more prosecutional models (<sup><a href="#B1">AGUIAR, FORTHCOMING</a></sup>), as the existence of a
				state institution capable of defence with a strength equivalent to that of the
				prosecution can destabilise a penal system so marked by punishment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that there's a change in the Democratic State that's largely reflected in
					the criminal model. We are advancing towards a State where, 'it is the monopoly
					of the State to accuse', you see… today we have a model of a State that defends,
					but we are moving towards a model in which the State Prosecutor's office, it is
					the <em>custos legis</em> of the procedures, you see. Perhaps we'll
					migrate towards a model in which the Public Defender's Office will assume the
					function of <em>custos legis</em> of criminal defence. Because if I have
					a State that is strongly armed to prosecute you, we have to have a State
					strongly armed to defend you (<sup><a href="#B30">Interview nº10,
						2012</a></sup>).</p></blockquote>
<p>As it is a struggle with material and symbolic aspects, in the public defender's
				view, the reform – with its expansion of competent jurisdictions, gain of autonomy
				and consequent salary equalisation – caused a change in the very "tripod" of the
				justice system:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We make up the tripod of the justice system. In truth, this is the justice
					system: the judge judges, the prosecutor prosecutes and the defender defends.
					Without that, there is no criterion for justice, not to mention any equality, so
					we need to give it its due recognition (<sup><a href="#B31">Interview n º 11, 2012</a></sup>).</p>
<p>This generates quite a clash, which is part of this process of institutional
					construction and of other constructions, part of assimilating the fact that
					'when a new player enters the field, the others have to adapt', so I see these
					asymmetries as natural. What was the question of wages, of salary equalisation
					about? This is a very important question, not just for the institution, but also
					socially because the Public Defender's Office previously used to be just a
					temporary career (<sup><a href="#B30">Interview nº 10,
					2012</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The judge is assisted by two justice bodies, the SPO that prosecutes and the PDO
					that defends. Does it seem fair to you that the one who prosecutes should earn
					more than the one who defends? This was something that used to make us very
					uncomfortable (<sup><a href="#B31">Interview nº 11,
					2012</a></sup>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it is not the direct focus of this article, which focuses on internal
				institutional analysis, we must contextualise the external and inter-institutional
				aspects of this process of attaining autonomy, which does not occur without fighting
				and conflict. This is the case particularly among the actors of the justice system
				themselves, with the political and judicial struggles between the Public Defender's
				Office and the State Prosecutor's Office regarding the legitimacy of filing
				public-interest civil actions and the defence of diffuse and collective rights<sup><a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a></sup>. It is also true of the Public
				Defender's Office and the OAB (Ordem dos Advogados – Brazilian Bar Association),
				both regarding the professional exercise of the defenders and the requirement that
				they be members of the OAB because they are lawyers, and the other way around,
				between the OAB and the Public Defender's Offices against the increase of people
				qualifying for free legal assistance, including legal entities<sup><a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a></sup>. Furthermore, the fact that the OAB's political
				power in some states delayed the structuring of some Public Defender's Offices<sup><a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a></sup> must also be mentioned.</p>
<p>Having understood the reform and attainment of independence from ideational and
				governance points of view, we will now look at how the processes of
				institutionalisation and independence occurred in the Brazilian states.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp7997584"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Institutionalisation and independence in the Brazilian state public defender's
				offices</p>
<p>In order to demonstrate the changes caused by the institutionalisation of the Public
				Defender's Office in Brazil, we analysed three time periods. The data presented for
				the first period (2004) covers the institutions before the reform, the data from
				2006 shows the institutional transition and the data from 2009 shows a stable
				institution five years after the constitutional changes that guaranteed
				independence.</p>
<p>In order to investigate a possible relationship between institutionalisation and the
				achievement of autonomy and independence by the state PDOs, we built two indicators.
				The first one, regarding institutionalisation, was created with the variables time
				of creation and number of competitive civil-service examinations held. To build the
				second indicator, one regarding independence, from which we would be able to measure
				the independence of the Public Defender's Office institution in the states, we
				established a ranking system that computed the presence or absence of certain
				powers. The index consists of a two-point interval attributed to the presence or
				absence of each feature, making it possible to see a greater degree of independence
				in states with high scores. It must be mentioned that the study analysed the
				independence of exclusively <em>de jure</em> measures. Along with the
				analysis of the indicators, the variables promoting collective actions and legal
				representation in the Inter-American System of Human Rights served to present a
				panorama, albeit a restricted one, of the actions in each period.</p>
<p>In line with studies on the independence of judicial institutions, our data on
				independence considered two larger areas – one regarding the institutional
				procedures that rule the institution and the other one regarding the Chief Public
				Defender's exercise of power. In the first dimension, there are variables aimed at
				verifying the presence of independence in legal terms, such as the existence of an
				organic law and a board of the public defender's office, and other variables
				focusing on the procedural exercise of independence, such as the selection of a
				Chief Public Defender from a three-candidate list. Finally, there are variables that
				indicate the actual exercise of independence, such as the availability of financial
				resources without subordination to the state administration. The second dimension
				includes variables that indicate the amount of power in the hands of the Chief
				Public Defender, in terms of creating and abolishing posts, hiring, discipline and
				budgetary choices.</p>

			</p>
<p>From the indicators built, we carried out various analyses using as a reference the
				three time periods (2004, 2006, 2009), which portray the scenario of the institution
				before and after the reform.</p>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp8013184"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Before the reform: state Public Defender's Offices in 2004</p>
<p>In 2004, five Public Defender's Offices had no independence (DF, PA, PE, RS and
						TO)<sup><a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a></sup>, 12 had low
					independence (AL, AM, AP, BA, ES, MA, MG, PB, PI, RO, RR and SE) and five were
					considered independent (AC, CE, MS, MT and RJ).</p>
<p>From the analysis of the state PDOs prior to the reform that granted
					independence, we saw that even before the reform there was a trend of increasing
					powers in the institution. In the non-independent Public Defender's Offices, the
					degree of interference in decisions was very high, without the possibility of
					the institution defining its job posts, and especially not its budget and wages.
					The scenario was different in the independent institutions, although they were
					few in number and still had no significant prerogatives regarding wages and
					budgetary issues. Regarding people served, whether or not the PDOs were
					independent bore no relation to an increase in the number of people served and
					suits filed.</p>
<p>Before the reform, there was great variation in the independence of the Chief
					Public Defender. It was in states without independent PDOs that there was most
					difficulty in creating or abolishing posts, adjusting wages, imposing
					disciplinary sanctions and promoting civil servants. The more the Public
					Defender's Offices became independent, the greater the power of the Chief Public
					Defender, but his role was always limited in budgetary and wage issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp8018208"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">During the reform: state Public Defender's Offices in 2006</p>
<p>In 2006, the data showed very significant changes, with only one PDO remaining
					without independence (DF). However, the number of PDOs with low independence
					rose in 14 states (AC, AL, AM, AP, CE, ES, MA, MG, PA, PB, PE, PI, RN and SE)
					and the number of states with PDOs considered independent rose to nine (BA, MS,
					MT, RJ, RO, RR, RS, SP and TO).</p>
<p>During the reform, the political characteristics of the Federal District and the
					fact that it is the federal capital directly affected the granting of
					independence. In institutions with low independence, the formal and procedural
					prerogatives remained, since in each state there was an organic law and a Higher
					Council, and in half the states the Chief Public Defender was selected from a
					list of three candidates. There was a trend of increasing power held by the head
					of the institution relating to the establishment of internal criteria such as
					disciplinary sanctions. However, there were still restrictions on the exercise
					of power regarding financial questions, such as setting and adjusting wages and
					creating and abolishing posts.</p>
<p>This panorama drastically changes when the independent Public Defender's Offices
					are compared with one another during the reform, as for the first time they saw
					an increase in the exercise of their autonomy, both in formal and procedural
					terms. In all states, an organic law and a Higher Council came into existence,
					with the choice of the chief of the institution being made from a list of three
					candidates. The Chief Public Defender's exercise of power also increased in
					practically all states, allowing him to create new posts and abolish posts and
					to set and adjust wages in more than half the institutions.</p>
<p>A trend of growing independence and prerogatives regarding the institution's
					internal and organizational aspects could be seen. However, decisions regarding
					finances were still made by the federal administration in the majority of
					cases.</p>
<p>From the analysis of the state Public Defender's Offices during the reform, we
					saw a trend of rising autonomy, observed in the increase of prerogatives for
					deciding on posts and holding competitive civil-service examinations, but still
					restricted in budgetary and wage issues. We saw a gain in terms of the
					institution's power of organisation from an internal point of view, but the
					financial decisions were still being made by the administration of the states in
					the majority of cases.</p>
<p>As for people served, it is interesting to see a trend of PDOs initiating class
					actions, in keeping with the legal system, although the experience of legal
					representation in the Inter-American System of Human Rights was a rare exception
					in the states.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp8025344"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">After the reform: state Public Defender's Offices in 2009</p>
<p>In 2009, the Federal District remained the only Public Defender's Office without
					independence. It is important to highlight that the data for that year showed
					the presence of new PDOs, such as those of Paraná and Goiás, which in spite of
					having been created, did not provide data for the research. There was no data
					for the state of Santa Catarina, either, as it did not have a PDO at the time.
					In that year, the number of PDOs with low independence fell to 13 (AC, AM, AP,
					CE, ES, MA, MG, PB, PA, PE, PI, RN and SE) and the number of PDOs considered
					independent rose to 10 (AL, BA, MS, MT, RJ, RO, RR, RS, SP and TO).</p>
<p>If we ignore the Federal District as the only Public Defender's Office that
					remained without independence after the reform, it is interesting to note that
					inequality remained in the independent and low-independence Public Defender's
					Offices, especially regarding the Chief Public Defender's exercise of power.
					Another interesting fact is that in low-independence states, there were cases of
					reduced guarantees in the 2006-2009 period. Thus, among the low-independence
					PDOs, the number of states that could choose a Chief Public Defender from a
					three-candidate list decreased, and among the powers of the Chief Public
					Defender, the possibility to hold competitive civil-service examinations also
					decreased. Regarding the filing of class actions, these remained the same in
					PDOs with low independence and rose in the independent ones, with legal
					representation in the Inter-American System of Human Rights limited to one PDO
					from each group.</p>
<p><a href="#f03">Figure 3</a> synthesises the variables of
					achievement of independence for each one of the groups and <a href="#f04">Figure 4</a> presents the variables by state throughout the

				</p>
<p>The comparative analysis of the 2006 and 2009 periods – that is, before and after
					the reform – does not show very significant changes. It is interesting to note
					that the achievement of <em>de jure </em>autonomy, or gaining autonomy
					in legal terms, has the effect of driving change. Yet the actual implementation
					of autonomy does not consolidate itself, and the characteristics found
					immediately after the constitutional and legislative change remain. The
					prerogatives of internal interference in institutions increase and consolidate
					themselves, but the powers regarding financial issues turn out to be hard to
					consolidate in several states.</p>
<p>If we compare the institution's degree of institutionalisation with its degree of
					autonomy in 2004, 2006 and 2009, we see that there is no direct relation between
					the fact that the Public Defender's Offices were institutionalised and their
					autonomy.</p>
<p>What the analysis reveals, which corroborates a great part of the studies on
					judicial independence and some theoretical studies on the autonomy of the State
					Prosecutor's Office, is that in spite of them having <em>de jure</em>
					independence (by law, stipulated by it), in fact, many state Public Defender's
					Offices are not independent because autonomy means meeting prerequisites which
					at the time the states had not met. Although we see an evolving panorama, we can
					draw conclusions from the gap between what the law stipulates and what actually
					occurs.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reveal national disparities, and bearing in mind the social
					differences between Brazilian states, we established a comparison between the
					Human Development Index in the states and their independence indicator for each
					period.</p>
<p>In 2004, out of the five Public Defender's Offices without independence, two of
					them were in states with a high HDI (RS and DF), two in a state with a medium
					low HDI (PE and TO) and one in a state with a low HDI (PA). Out of the 12 PDOs
					with low independence, one of them was in a state with a high HDI (ES), four in
					states with a medium high HDI (AM, AP, MG, RO), three in states with a medium
					low HDI (BA, RO, SE) and four in states with a low HDI (AL, MA, PB, PI). Lastly,
					out of the five independent PDOs, two were in states with a high HDI, one in a
					state with a medium high HDI (MT), one in a state with a medium low HDI (AC) and
					one in a state with a low HDI (CE).</p>
<p>In 2006, the only Public Defender's Office without independence was found in a
					state with a high HDI (DF). Out of the 14 PDOs with low independence, one was in
					a state with a high HDI (ES), three in states with a medium high HDI (AM, AP,
					MG), four in states with a medium low HDI (AC, PA, RN, SE) and six in states
					with a low HDI (AL, CE, MA, PB, PI, PE). And lastly, out of the nine independent
					Public Defender’s Offices, four were in states with a high HDI (MS, RJ, RS, SP),
					two in states with a medium high HDI (MT, RO) and three in states with a medium
					low HDI (BA, RR, TO). In 2006, there were no independent PDOs in states with a
					low HDI.</p>
<p>In 2009, the two Public Defender's Offices without independence were found in
					states with a high HDI (DF and PR). Out of the 13 PDOs that had low
					independence, one was in a state with a high HDI (ES), three in states with a
					medium high HDI (AM, AP, MG), four were in states with a medium low HDI (AC, PA,
					RN, SE) and five in states with a low HDI (CE, MA, PB, PI, PE). Lastly, out of
					the 10 independent PDOs, four were in states with a high HDI (MS, RJ, RS, SP),
					two in a state with a medium high HDI (MT, RO), three in one with a medium low
					HDI (BA, RR, TO) and one in a state with a low HDI (AL).</p>
<p>The map below illustrates the panorama in the last period.</p>
<p>
					<!--_ STANDARD  _--><div class="figure">

								states in 2009 </span></p>
</div>
				</p>
<p>This distribution shows that prior to the reform there was no valid relationship
					between independence and HDI. In spite of this, we were able to see that during
					the reform there was a tendency for non-independent states with a low HDI to
					remain so. They seemed incapable of establishing independent Public Defender's
					Offices. A comparison between periods showed a tendency towards an expansion of
					independence after the reform, including in states with a low HDI. However, the
					fact that states with a high HDI remained non-independent after that reform is
					worthy of attention, as it shows that as well as socioeconomic criteria,
					cultural and political factors also interfere in the institutional trajectories
					of states such as Paraná and the Federal District.</p>

<a name="idp8052624"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Conclusion</p>
<p>This article has investigated the institutionalisation and reform that granted
				independence and new functions to the Public Defender's Office in Brazil, with a
				focus on the process in the states. Our main findings can be summarised as
				follows:</p>
<p>In the Brazilian case, the achievement of independence can be explained based on two
				theoretical references of judicial empowerment. In ideational terms, the reform and
				attainment of independence originate from a long process of fighting for democracy
				and for guaranteeing rights in Brazil, even before the end of the military regime.
				The presence of pressure groups, associations and political actors in the
				institutionalisation of democratic policies in Brazil has shown itself to be vital,
				as has the great pressure exerted by international bodies, which have been eager for
				justice systems reforms and for executive bodies that are actually independent. From
				the governance point of view, there has been a visible change in the patterns of
				Brazilian federalism in the last few decades, from the granting of independence to
				the three subnational entities (federation, states and municipalities), resulting in
				a strengthening of regional inequalities, to a more recent one by the federal
				Executive attempting to establish uniformity, often using judicialisation as
				support. The PDOs’ independence can be seen as an attempt to standardise public
				assistance to the most vulnerable sectors in the states, thus aiming at guaranteeing
				more equitable access to justice in the country.</p>
<p>This process did not occur without struggles and conflict, especially among the
				justice system's actors themselves, revealing an overt clash between the Public
				Defender's Office, the State Prosecutor's Office and the Brazilian Bar
				Association.</p>
<p>The institutionalisation and implementation of independence in the states took place
				in a slow and varied fashion. There was a rise in independence in procedural terms,
				an increase in the Chief Public Defender's power, but there are still restrictions
				as to his power in budgetary matters. Public defenders are now more independent in
				the exercise of their new powers, such as in the filing of class actions. In spite
				of a constant increase in the number of defenders in the states, of the higher
				budgets in the institutions and of the average wages of these professionals, there
				are still deficits (in terms of active and needed defenders) and inequalities
				(compared to other bodies of the justice system).</p>
<p>Few studies have aimed to investigate the role of the other institutions integrating
				the justice system. An understanding of the processes of institutionalisation and
				independence of these new institutions – considered vital for the consolidation of
				democracy in Latin American countries – is crucial for carrying out comparative
				analyses of legal studies in political science. And this is a debate that has only
				just begun.</p>

<a name="fn1"></a><p><sup>1</sup> This article was developed based on a wider piece of research titled
						<em>Acesso à justiça em contexto de judicialização da política: um
						estudo sobre o papel e a efetividade da atuação da Defensoria Pública do Rio
						Grande do Sul (</em>Access to justice in the context of the
					judicialisation of politics: a study on the role and effectiveness of the
					actions of the Rio Grande do Sul Public Defender's Office). Funded with
					resources from the FAPERGS (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Rio Grande do Sul –
					Rio Grande do Sul Research Foundation) and carried out between 2011 and
					2013.</p>

<a name="fn2"></a><p><sup>2</sup> Few Latin American countries have constitutionalised Public Defender's Offices
					(Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and
					Venezuela). In the majority of countries, there are either no PDOs (Antigua and
					Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti,
					Honduras and St. Lucia) or there are systems created by infra-constitutional
					legislations (Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador, Ecuador,
					Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago).</p>

<a name="fn3"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn3"></a><p><sup>3</sup> The work of Cappellettti and Garth (1988) is a milestone in the discussions on
					access to justice. Among their publications, we found the thesis on the
					development of access to justice in three waves. It assumes the expansion of the
					offer of legal services to poor sectors of the population, the incorporation of
					collective and diffuse interests and the consideration of alternative mechanisms
					for settling disputes.</p>
</div>

					a comparative perspective, see Cleber Francisco Alves's (2005) doctoral thesis,

<a name="fn5"></a><p><sup>5</sup> ADIN 3943 (Direct Action for the Declaration of Constitutionality 3943) is
					currently following the legal channels through the STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal
					– Federal Supreme Court). It was proposed by the Associação Nacional de Membros
					do Ministério Público (CONAMP – National Association of Members of the State
					Prosecutor’s Office) and contests the constitutionality of the law that allows
					the Public Defender’s Office to file public-interest civil actions – article 5
					of Law 7,347/1985, as drafted by Law 11,448/2007
					(http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/processo/verProcessoAndamento.asp?incidente=2548440),
					as well as ARE 690.838 (Extraordinary Interlocutory Appeal 690.838), which
					recognised the general repercussion of the constitutional question
					(http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=223069). It
					is also worth referring to the literature on the achievement of autonomy by the
					State Prosecutor’s Office itself and the construction of the legitimacy of
					proposing this type of action (<sup><a href="#B7">ARANTES,
						1999)</a></sup>.</p>

Abstract The recent literature states that one of the main challenges for the Brazilian Political Science is to increase its degree of internationalization. This article seeks to contribute to the debate by mapping the degree of international mobility among Brazilians scholars (training and publication in international journals). The specific objectives are: 1) to identify the percentage and the profile of scholars with international careers; 2) to check whether there is a relationship between training opportunities and publication abroad and 3) to identify the main destinations (countries) among Brazilian political science scholars.

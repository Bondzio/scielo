Abstract: This paper proposes a reflection about the development discourses as constructed by the Peasant Women Movement (MMC in Portuguese), accessed by documental analysis and observation of women participants&#8217; practices. The first part deals with the different discourses about women and development, punctuating some of the major changes over the past decades. The next section analyzes the main elements that build MMC&#8217;s development discourse, which is opposed to the proposed guiding principles from development agencies. We also analyze the singularities in the proposal of a 'peasant feminism&#8217;, leading to problematize the 'care' as the defining category of the female role in the transformations related to the development, especially taking practices that focus on agriculture and health.

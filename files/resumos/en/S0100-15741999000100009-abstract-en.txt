Considering the importance of early experiences, particularly regarding responsiveness and synchrony in the interactions with the environment, with important effects on the cognitive, affective and social areas, this study aimed to search the day-care-centers possibilities as interactional contexts. 62 children aged 1 to 3 years old, from 5 different day-care centers, half of them from private and the others from public day-care centers, were observed at their natural play settings, in three sessions of 10 minutes each, obtained in different days. Samples of interactive episodes between adults and children were qualitatively examined, aiming to identify the interactional partners and the ways through which children and adults set themselves in the whole interactional pattern. The results of this analysis suggest that the adult, besides the expected strategies of individual and collective communication, use ordinarily a third basic communication strategy, called articuled communication, with thematic and other forms of alternation between the targets. In this pattern, the adult extends the interactions that occur with an individual to others, amplifying the interactive episode, creating links between themes and individuals. These results are discussed in terms of the inadequacy of the opposition between dyadic versus polyadic situations, that is generally used to compare the rearing contexts in family and collective environments.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"A &Aacute;frica na Pol&iacute;tica Internacional    - O sistema interafricano e sua inser&ccedil;&atilde;o mundial", written by    Paulo Fagundes Visentini, full professor of International Relations at the Federal    University of Rio Grande do Sul, is an important contribution to both African    studies in Brazil and to general knowledge in the field of international relations    for the country as a whole. The author, a renowned Brazilian historian and an    international relations expert, detains vast academic publications and has been    for some time now dedicating himself to the study and analysis of Brazil-Africa    relations, the international insertion of African states and the formation and    development of the interafrican system itself. Therefore, the book here addressed    is the result of years of research and thoughtful consideration from the author    upon this theme, which included research field trips to Africa to accomplish    this task.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Brazil, studies - and, consequently, the knowledge    and thinking about international relations in Africa - are still modest. It    is, in fact, astonishing that in a country with such a territorial dimension    as Brazil, long historical ties with the African continent and with a significant    presence of afrodescent population, not to mention the enormous and increasing    diplomatic, trade, economic and financial interests on "the other side" of the    Atlantic, has produced so little about African realities. In this sense, Paulo    Visentini's book is a bearer of good news not only for the Brazilian academy    but also for a varied and not specialist public. As a matter of fact, the author    himself, in the introduction, directs the readers of the university-manual format    of the book precisely in order to present Africa and its main analytical debates    to students, its predominant target audience.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The main objective of the book, as clearly defined    on its title, is to analyze the international insertion of African states and    the formation of the interafrican system. In order to do so, the author goes    through a long trajectory with the aim of demonstrating that the idea of an    isolated continent within the international scenario and internally disconnected    does not hold true. Furthermore, he observes the vast majority of African leaders    have been for a long time paying particular attention to the external context,    both as a path to overcome underdevelopment and to obtain legitimacy and support    to their governments. Incidentally, the author defends that the search for economic    development is a common characteristic among African states since the wave of    independency, although he also considers that these states naturally present    specific international agendas giving their geographical location and political    and economic attributes, among other observable differences within such an ample    universe within this continent.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first two chapters - the first, co-authored    with Anal&uacute;cia Danilevicz Pereira and the second, with Luiz Dario Ribeiro    - show precisely the richness of African societies in pre-colonial times, including    their interafrican fluxes and intercontinental connections, followed by an analysis    of the process of conquest and division of Africa by the Europeans at the end    of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the slow consolidation of the colonial system,    until the decolonization period following World War II. This part of the book,    essentially historical, presents a good synthesis of the whole process.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the third chapter onwards, the author analyzes    in detail the emergence and development of the interafrican system and the international    insertion of African states. In fact, chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 can be considered    a second and main part of the book as the author analyzes the formation of the    African system and the international insertion of new African states at the    same time that a periodization is proposed according to his interpretation of    the 1960-2009 period, approximately.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, there is a chapter devoted to Brazil-Africa    relations. This chapter elaborates a synthesis of the relationship between the    two sides of the Atlantic with an emphasis on Brazilian perspectives. The objective    is to demonstrate the historical density of this relationship going back to    the period Brazil was still a Portuguese colony and that, throughout time, in    spite of the rupture observed between the end of slave trade and the de-colonization    process in mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, these relations were restored after    the independencies and became denser until they reached a peak during the government    of ex-president Lula (2003-2010), producing a qualitative jump from then on    and placing Brazil-African relations at a new and unprecedented level.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most important contribution of the book for    Brazilian scholars lies in the second part, that is, the chapters dealing with    the origins, motivations and operations of the African system and the international    insertion of these states. This is a relevant emphasis because it is by far    the least discussed by Brazilian historians, political scientists and internationalists    dedicated to the study of Africa. It is possible to say that before the publication    of Paulo Visentini's book, themes like these had only been dealt with in a fragmented    manner in few articles, dissertations and thesis by Brazilian authors. Furthermore,    the analysis in this book as a whole but especially in this second part, presents    the vision and thoughtful consideration of a Brazilian intellectual concerned    with the international insertion of African states and their continental relations,    a welcome task given his own view on African issues from a Brazilian point of    view. For a long time, we have been followers of the visions emanated essentially    from the North, especially Europe, incidentally a vision full of prejudice and    contaminated by a sense of superiority intrinsic to the colonialism of the metropoles.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is interesting that even publications that    produce a synthesis of Brazil-Africa relations are rare. The exceptions are    the renowned work of Jos&eacute; Hon&oacute;rio Rodrigues (<i>Brasil e &Aacute;frica:    outro horizonte</i>, published in 1964) and Jos&eacute; Fl&aacute;vio Sombra    Saraiva (<i>O Lugar da &Aacute;frica: a dimens&atilde;o atl&acirc;ntica da pol&iacute;tica    externa brasileira, de 1946 a nossos dias</i>, published in 1996; and <i>&Aacute;frica    Parceira do Brasil Atl&acirc;ntico </i>- <i>Rela&ccedil;&otilde;es internacionais    do Brasil e da &Aacute;frica no in&iacute;cio do s&eacute;culo XXI</i>, published    in 2012). Although the quality of these books is undisputed, there is still    a long path for Brazilian academic production to come nearer the profound and    complex dimension that links this country to the African continent since its    emergence.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Visentini provides a fine context of the decolonization    process and the emergence of new African states, revealing their structural    fragilities as the result of the colonial domination system and the initial    difficulties faced by African leaders, who had to invariably deal with all sort    of problems such as the international context of the Cold War and the interventionist    practices of powerful nations especially the former metropolitan states. Nevertheless,    an in-depth discussion on the nature of these new states and how local elites    dealt with legitimacy issues of new governments, especially concerning the domestic    base of this legitimacy, are still missing.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A relevant aspect which has not been forgotten    by the author refers to the issue of African diversity. Thus, there is a concern    to show the diverse experiences and political trajectories of African states,    although it is also possible to identify, as the author does, points of convergence    and common phases in their political lives. For Visentini, these phases are:    a) the ascension to independence; b) the formation of a system of African states;    c) the conflicts of the Cold War; d) pacification and marginalization; e) the    reinsertion of South Africa and the conflictive geopolitical reorganization    of Central Africa; and, f) the reaffirmation of Africa.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is noticeable in the analysis that there is    a concern with connecting the political evolution of the African continent with    a global level of analysis, that is, the transformation of the international    system throughout the Cold War, including its termination by the end of the    1980s, having strong implications for African political life. To some extent,    many of the conflicts seen in the continent had an intense external influence.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the African regions, Southern Africa received    the most detailed attention. This is quite understandable given the fact that    the racist and powerful regime of the Republic of South Africa meant, on the    one hand, a point of disequilibrium and destabilization for the whole region    particularly during the existence of the apartheid regime. On the other hand,    however, the actions of South Africa produced a sort of anti-apartheid alignment    giving birth to a political action known as the Frontline States, an initial    group to the regional integration of Southern Africa. Besides, the late decolonization    process of Portuguese colonial areas, the atypical case of Southern Rhodesia,    nowadays Zimbabwe, and the progressing external interferences within the context    of the Cold War, gave to the region a special connotation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is possible to assume that the author sees    the Republic of South Africa as an actor that deserves special attention. In    fact, the country had and still has an enormous importance to the region. Counting    on an industrial economy and connected to the dynamic centers of global capitalism,    the South African state counts on a structure not found in any other African    actor, neither in the region nor the rest of the continent. Therefore, if the    destabilizing power of South Africa was huge, once apartheid was overcome and    the country became a de facto democracy and reintegrated in a positive way to    interafrican relations, there was a moment of great euphoria with the possibility    of South Africa becoming a kind of vector or driver of regional development.    Nevertheless, the author argues that the control of South Africa's large capital    remaining in the hands of the beneficiaries of the apartheid regime created    a tension between a more benevolent political perspective and the permanence    of the reality exercise of some degree of regional hegemony.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another important aspect that deserves attention    is the analysis of the more modern stage of the African international insertion.    In fact, the author properly analyzes the transition from a period of profound    crisis that created a generalized sense of pessimism, typical of the 1990s,    to a phase known as "African Renaissance", emerged at the end of the first decade    in the post-Cold War era which was followed by a sense of rediscovery of Africa    by former metropolitan states, the United States and emerging countries such    as China, India and Brazil. Thus, in general terms, the continent starts off    the 21<sup>st</sup> century on the right foot, with positive signs of growth.    This fact has also produced a renewal within the African system itself, by the    replacement of the old Organisation of African Unity (OAU) by the current African    Union (UA) among other local schemes and arrangements such as the New Partnership    for Africa's Development or NEPAD.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In sum, Paulo Visentini's book presents a great    academic merit and it is, for sure, a relevant contribution to a better understanding    of the history and, above all, the international relations of the African continent    over the last decades. A reader interested in understanding Africa contemporary    international relations will have an excellent introduction to the subject with    Professor Visentini's book.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Translated by Sandra Gomes</font></p>      ]]></body>

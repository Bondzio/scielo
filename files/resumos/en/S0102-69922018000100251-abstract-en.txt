Abstract: In recent years, it has been observed growing interest in the study and use of quantitative techniques in Social Sciences. Similarly, there is a wider debate about its uses and the creation of new tools and approaches to the application of Quantitative Methodology in social and political studies. In order to reflect on these issues from theoretical and empirical experience, we interviewed two professors / researchers from different generations who are important references in the area, Prof. Dr. Nelson do Valle Silva, of Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Políticos da Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (IESP-UERJ) and Prof. Dr. Jerônimo Muniz, of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG).

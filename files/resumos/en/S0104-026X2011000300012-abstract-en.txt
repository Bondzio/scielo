This paper wishes to address, through an anthropological perspective, the corporal dimension of sporting practices and some features of its genderization. Departing from Marcel Mauss' notion of 'body technique', we emphasize the cultural dimension on the rationalization, valorization d legitimacy of certain body techniques applied to sports (taking as an example the universe of martial arts), and in which way such techniques rationalize, value and legitimate gendered positions, in this case, of masculine identity.

The aim of this paper is to present the results of an intervention research carried on in a public school for students with special needs in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In this school the youth make use of the photography in order to interact with their daily routine. On the basis of the photographic images created by them, the youth construct narratives showing a critical view of school environment. This research favoured a non conventional approach of the school, based upon the narratives and views produced by the students. Actually a dialogue was engaged through the process of production and interpretation of the photographs, and this dialogue showed singular features to the special schools but also showed features shared by special and regular schools and propitiated a sensitive and critical analysis about the social interaction and the learning process.

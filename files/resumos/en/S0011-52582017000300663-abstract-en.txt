ABSTRACT The following article provides a contextualized mapping of the academic debates characterizing the first decade of DADOS journal&#8217;s publication (1966-1976). Historically speaking, this reflects a tightening of the military dictatorship, while from a thematic and theoretical point of view, it concerns the shift from the former national-developmental ideology to a sociology of knowledge that, at the end of the period under study, splits into a form of historic sociology and a form of political science, with both concerned with the study of authoritarianism in general and the study of this in Brazil in particular. In terms of authors, the shift is one from the old essayist and nationalist Brazilian political science to a new strand committed to rigorous reflection based on professional criteria, as well as democratic values.

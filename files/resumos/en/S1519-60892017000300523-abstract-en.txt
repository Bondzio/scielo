Abstract: The purpose of this article is to offer a first overview of Hermann Lübbe's extensive philosophical work. Two of his main research topics are stressed here: the history of philosophy, and the phenomenology of time experience in modern societies. This has been done through the following steps: (1) intellectual contextualization, (2) Habermas&#8217; criticisms on his positions, (3) Lübbe's methodological pluralism, and (4) his description of the social and cultural consequences of modern civilizational acceleration, as well as some possibilities for this approach in the interpretation of the Brazilian protest waves of June 2013.

Abstract: Prenatal testing for fetal anomaly does what medicalization often does: it individualizes social problems, and places the responsibility for managing them on the shoulders of individual women. If as a society we do not provide the services and assistance that families of disabled children require, we leave women in the impossible position of terminating otherwise wanted pregnancies, and asking them to see that as a moment of 'choice'.

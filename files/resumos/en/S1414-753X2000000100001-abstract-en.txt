Sustainable development, like any deveolopment, happens in time. But this process does not occur in the time of biological evolution or economic growth. It is not within cronological time that inercies happen and tendencies of existing reality take place. Sustentability is in the edge of the modern unidimensional rationality, of a civilization in crisis which opens new horizons and evokes different senses of time. Sustainability contains different times of diverse material and symbolic processes -geological, biological, economic, technological, cultural- and gathers different rationalities which shape environmental complexity. Sustainability times are forged by forms that are projected from the past to the future, resulting in new identities. This perspective inspires a heideggerian phenomenologic view on the times of sustainability.

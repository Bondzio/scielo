This text presents the results of a research about the program Minha Casa, Minha Vida - "Entities", one of the social housing policies launched in 2009, as to its part in the group of social welfare programs of the governments of Lula and Dilma Rousseff. These results from a research which is still going on point to dilemmas, paradoxes, and dimensions which involve the demand, the operators, the production processes of the housing compounds, and the production and reproduction of inequality and segregation in the city of SÃ£o Paulo. Also, it points to the constitution of a field of agreements which permeates the relations between movements for housing and the State inside what can be called Lulismo.

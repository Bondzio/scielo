This article proposes a retrospective analysis of an ethnographic study conducted in a medical establishment for the elderly. Its aim is to understand which social and organizational conditions favour a culture of care. The research was unable to overcome the racial antagonisms between the management and supervision team and the team of carers. However it did formalize the opposition between the professionalism conceived by the supervisors as maintaining a good distance and the ethics of care of the nursing auxiliaries and carers expressed in terms of love.

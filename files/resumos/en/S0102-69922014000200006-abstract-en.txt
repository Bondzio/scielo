In this text I'm interested in discussing the importance of leading feminist analysis to the bodies of women in contemporary societies in Latin America, especially since the rise of a set of discourses and practices carried out by women whose goal is to achieve the highest standards of beauty and perfection under the standards and qualities required by the image culture and consumption characteristics of our times. I believe that a privileged issue is cosmetic surgeries that have proliferated in our countries as everyday practices at the cost of health and the side effects that many of these surgeries contributed to women's bodies. Thus, in the present trial show the way in which hegemonic gender culture constantly reiterates from representations of femininity that revolve around the beauty and perfection as standard.

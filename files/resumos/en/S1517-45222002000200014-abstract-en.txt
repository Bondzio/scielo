The most publicized construction projects in Mercosur member-countries lack references for work risks and health preventive management, in bidding documents and feasibility studies. That is why we intend to draw a picture of the current state of the debate on work risks in construction works. The aim was to interpret social determinants of the health-disease process in construction sites and to identify the ways for managing work risks. The methodology adopted was quali-quantitative, with use of secondary data (census and polls); the direct observation technique in construction sites; interviews and polls. Besides, the scope of negotiations in the 10 and 11 Mercosur subgroups are examined. Finally, limitations of cover systems and record of labor diseases and accidents are argued, within a rise in "non-registered employment" and "informal employment", from its contrast with the globalized health approach and risk management in each stage of the construction work.

abstract The main objective of this article is to discuss the effects of the tax adjustments implemented by the second government of President Dilma Rousseff, especially regarding the Brazilian labor market. This adjustment has already produced negative results, leading to the loss of formal jobs, spreading unemployment and reducing the chances of maintaining real gains won by Brazilian workers in the last ten years. This crisis has also revealed the permanent state of Brazilian external vulnerability and the importance of our historical and cultural conditioning in the definition of each economic circumstance. The mitigation of the effects of this adjustment will require the strong political negotiation of a national development project.

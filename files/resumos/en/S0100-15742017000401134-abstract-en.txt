ABSTRACT The present text discusses the reconfiguration of professional teaching knowledge and its anchoring in the training of teachers, pointed toward a solid professional identity, constructed along a continuum of professional development. This vision requires a different relationship with the production of specific knowledge that allows contradiction of the movement of deprofessionalization and functionalization that teachers go through. It has implications for the degree of commitment of teaching to the results of the school as the socially mandated locus for the guarantee of learning essential to the citizenry, today fundamental to the support of the economy and the cohesion of societies.

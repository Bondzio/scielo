This paper presents an analysis of the Cadernos do Nosso Tempo magazine. Published between 1953 and 1956 by IBESP (Brazilian Institute of Economics, Sociology and Politics), marked an effort of national intelligence in promoting genuinely Brazilian thought. Combining articles of sociological, political, economic and cultural interpretation of Brazil, with the analysis of the phenomena of that time, consolidate a broad diagnosis of the country, a stinging analysis of the conditions and ways to achieve development. Main mobile, theme that united all IBESP intellectuals, was present in all numbers of Cadernos without remain unchanged. In our view, since the ideas seek to respond to the challenges and dilemmas placed by the particular context, the way that the development has been thought changed jointly to the transformations experienced in the country; that makes important to study Cadernos genetic and chronologically.

This article aims to analyze some dialogues, in the field of curriculum between the jongo, an Afro-Brazilian cultural practice, and quilombola school education, a new teaching method institutionalized in Brazil, based on a case study in a quilombola community (Santa Rita do Bracuí) located in the southern region of the state of Rio de Janeiro in the municipality of Angra dos Reis. In order to do this, fieldwork employing ethnographic methods with the prospect of a thorough description, was conducted for two years. We realized that quilombola children and youth have been building their ethnic identities through their insertion in the practice of jongo, contributing and legitimizing the demand of the political leaders of Bracuí to introduce this practice into the local school curriculum.

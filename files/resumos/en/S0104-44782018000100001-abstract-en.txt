ABSTRACT  Introduction The article proposes to list gender policies for Defense adopted by the governments of Argentina and Brazil in the period of 2005 to 2015. The relevance of the Argentine case stems from the country that has shown very active practices of its Defense Ministry. On the other hand, in Brazil occurs the recent establishment of the Commission of Gender in the Ministry of Defense, which aims to achieve the women&#8217;s rights and gender equality.  Methods Therefore, through a qualitative approach, procedural and historical the analysis uses primary sources from annual publications, reports and minutes of meetings in both countries.  Results From the analysis of the two cases, it can be seen that, even in the face of a scenario in which the effective incorporation of women has not yet been completed, the institution of a strong and taxing Ministry of Defense capable of controlling the proposed policies, linked to a which establishes equity as one of its presuppositions, were the requirements that allowed Argentina to become a regional exponent in the theme of gender.  Discussion Although the current debate on gender in the Armed Forces is relevant, the scientific contributions to the field are limited. Thus, the results presented are a way of updating the empirical data on the issue and provide inputs to expand the discussion about gender in the Armed Forces in Latin America.

Abstract In the period between May 2013 and February 2014, I was able to observe the daily routine of an erotic products store that aimed to spice up relationships. Located at Complexo do Alem√£o (one of the biggest favelas of Rio de Janeiro), the sexy boutique, as the owner would rather call it, usually sells objects, cosmetics, lingerie and erotic costumes. Besides these products, the store also offered themed classes and workshops focusing on the learning of seduction &#8220;techniques&#8221;, all directed to women. In the present paper, I intend to analyze an event that happened during my fieldwork, &#8220;The Gospel Project for Sex Shops&#8221;, willing to comprehend how sexual conventions and moralities are agencied in the context of gender, sexuality, religion and market issues.

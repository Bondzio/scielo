I propose in this article exploring the different ways of inhabiting Christian prisons in Buenos Aires Penitentiary System. This paper aims at understanding and explaining evangelical cell-blocks' general morphology; ie internal organizational forms and community spaces that shape different believers' profiles. "Being or resembling" araises as a problem in Christian's cell-blocks in the struggle for legitimate definitions in the construction of the true believers. The article is based on a corpus of in-depth interviews with inmates of evangelicalÂ´s cell-blocks, ex-convicts, directors, chaplains and pastors related to the prison.

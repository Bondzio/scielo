It reflects on how the illegal cocaine market affects the lives of residents in a transboundary territory between Brazil, Peru and Colombia. It observes how the negotiations around the cocaine commercialization have structured a peculiar moral economy in a border region full of social control devices that affect the economic practices of Brazilian, Peruvian and Colombian citizens. The research was developed through ethnographic incursions over four years in an investigation process that privileged the interpretation of residents of the region on the problem of production, commercialization and passage of cocaine by the triple border. The results are presented through an analytical treatment that aimed at understanding the social problems experienced by residents who, in their daily lives, participate in, or hear about, the actions of people involved in cocaine production, commercialization and circulation schemes through the border.

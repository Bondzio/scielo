Abstract The article aims to analyze the socio-political representations and daily practices of actors somewhat involved in state action, particularly through a cash transfer policy: Bolsa Família. With this in sight, it uses data from in-depth interviews and participant observation with civil servants (particularly Bolsa Família's registrars, social workers and health civil servants) and Bolsa Familia beneficiaries (as well as Bolsa Família candidates) on the periphery of Rio de Janeiro's metropolitan area. It seeks to understand how, in the context of this particular social policy, two antagonistic repertoires (rational-legal and emotive) are freely applied by Bolsa Familia registrars and social work assistants. The target population of such program (the poor) also react by using moral tools that justify they are deserving of the benefit and others are not, thus reinforcing moral repertoires (merit and honor) rather than civic ones (rights).

This study aims to understand the subjectivation processes (and their political effects) concerning the modes of psi knowledge. In order to do that, some definitions about subjectivity and its production processes are proposed. After this, the Actor-Network Theory contributions on the subject will be analyzed. Furthermore, this theory will provide guidelines for the study of the subjectivation modes based on the psi knowledge and practices. More specifically, this study will assess the ways the psi studies create words and subjects, through specific ontological policies, producing recalcitrants or extortives modes of articulations. The political discussion of these modes of subjectivation will be based on that.

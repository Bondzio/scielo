Abstract E-waste reverse logistics initiatives in important industrial economies like India, China and Brazil show that specific models of reverse logistics, adapted to local reality, are required in developing countries. This research objective is to discuss the main challenges and opportunities for the implementation of the reverse logistics Brazilian model for computers and cell phones. Methodological procedures included 21 in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders including government, manufacturers, retailers, recycling companies, waste picker organizations and academics. Results show the importance of the new regulation to enhance the dialogue among the members of the electro electronic supply chain for the development of the Brazilian model of reverse logistics. However technological gaps in recycling e-waste within the country, its continental dimension, taxation challenges and conflicts between waste picker organizations and the industry are challenges for the Brazilian model success.

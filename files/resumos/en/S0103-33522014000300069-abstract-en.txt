This paper seeks to address the phenomenon of judicialization of politics in Brazil from an analytical perspective that overcomes the liberal framework. It assumes that views on judicialization of politics are built from a common perspective, forged under the auspices of democratic and constitutional hegemonic theories. However, the Brazilian historical and constitutional reality - particularly after democratization - is innovative not only from the institutional point of view, but also because it entails the renewal of the terms for the relationship between civil society and State in shaping the political system, lending new shape to the phenomenon of judicialization of politics.

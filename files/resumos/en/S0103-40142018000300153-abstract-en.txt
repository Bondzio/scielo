ABSTRACT The objective of this article is to show how future Primary Education teachers use connections when planning didactic sequences to teach Mathematics. Ethnographic participant observation is undertaken to characterize the type of extra-disciplinary connections considered. This analysis allows us to affirm that future teachers value the use of real contexts as motivators and generators of mathematical knowledge, although the developments are not always epistemically justified. The difficulty in considering metaphorical connections is verified.

Abstract: I present in this article a critique of Oscar de Figueiredo Lustosa&#8217;s interpretation, established in his book Os bispos do Brasil e a imprensa, about the development of the catholic press in Brazil. To that end, I focus on the relations between the Holy See and the Brazilian ecclesiastical hierarchy since the end of the 19th century until the first decades of the republican regime. The Brazilian episcopacy valued the catholic press as a means of social re-christianization and to combat the enemies and the errors of modernity. However, the investments did not meet the expectations of the Holy See, evidencing the existence of resistance to pontifical determinations, in view of the different projects of social re-christianization and intervention in society.

Abstract This article aims to reflect upon the effects that have unfolded as a result of the relative democratization of access to digital media, especially in terms of the possibilities for economic and symbolic exchanges, among young people and residents of areas marked by processes of social precariousness in global metropolises. To this end, we analyze the way in which two collectives of rappers and audiovisual producers linked to peripheral regions of Lisbon and SÃ£o Paulo make use of a variety of communication tools, both in urban spaces and in cyberspace.

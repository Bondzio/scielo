I analyze here the social space of the city of Aragarças. Built by the Roncador-Xingu Expedition (1942-1943) and Fundação Brasil Central [(1943-1967), both contextualized in the movement March to the West, begun by Getúlio Vargas's government. The high part of the city, begun in the space named by the pioneers of the 'Old Base' is the materialization in the space of the social representations from community memory that was formed, in a special way, represented by the pioneer workers that lived in the city the acme of the Brazil Central Foundation, in the decades of 1940 and 1950. Its main works were the building of the hospital, Getúlio Vargas Hotel, the pottery , the airport and the bridges on the rivers Garças and Araguaia that united the city with Barra Garças (MT). At the period, a great regional aerial mesh is constituted, militarizing the aerial space of Central Brazil and Amazônia. In opposition, exists the low part of the city placed at the margins of the river Araguaia, that the Roncador-Xingu Exedition had already found hold for the gravel washer and backwoodsman. To understand the coalition city/pioneers is primordial to have access to the chain of signs that has produced a communication of the pioneer's of medium Araguaia culture and its social relationships.

Friendship appears topically as an important philosophical subject in the last texts of Foucault, especially in The hermeneutics of the subject and in his interviews. To think of concepts such as ascesis or friendship today is one of the great challenges bequeathed by Foucault. For the philosopher, friendship would be the rehabilitation of the aesthetics of existence into the present. This theme has been little explored by studies of the Foucaultian work, and even less so in the field of education. In this article, these issues are brought to the debate regarding teacher education by presenting some of the discussions developed in the research carried out with a group of basic education Arts teachers in the region of Santa Cruz do Sul, at the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The text addresses the possibility of artistic invention in the process of teacher education as a problem and considers it as a necessarily shared action which occurs in the relation to others. In this discussion, I resort to Michel Foucault's theory of the practices of the self, which are not dissociated from intersubjective relations. Some questions inspired by the Foucaultian problematization are the object of concern in this text: What can be expected from schools as a locus of education or from universities as propellers of teacher education? What type of teaching can emerge from education groups and networks of friendship?

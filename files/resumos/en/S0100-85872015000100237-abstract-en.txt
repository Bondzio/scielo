Abstract The present paper focusses on a gift offered by a candombl&#233; community from the city of Salvador to the orix&#225; Oxum. It describes the trajectory of the gift &#8211; from its preparation in the cult house to its consummation in the sea &#8211; and follows both the practices that give shape to the gift and the relations and entities which it promotes and helps articulate. Special attention is given to practices of concealment and exhibition at play in the gift&#8217;s preparation and to the modes of seeing that are related to them.

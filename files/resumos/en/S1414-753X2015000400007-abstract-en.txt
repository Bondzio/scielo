Understanding the relationship between local people and protected areas (PAs) is essential for improving the management of these areas. The local peoples' perspectives of their relationship with PAs were analyzed based on secondary data. We focused on five Federal Coastal-Marine PAs in the state of Santa Catarina and five analytical domains: economic, environmental, spatial, organizational and cultural. We analyzed 21 studies that together contemplated all domains. Fishing was the most important economic activity for local peoples. For all PAs, negative environmental impacts were registered. Conflicts in use of space, distance between local people and PAs management, and decline of fishing activity were also reported. The comparison of the analytical domains allowed us to identify gaps in the knowledge to be investigated and important points to be addressed by the managers of the PAs.

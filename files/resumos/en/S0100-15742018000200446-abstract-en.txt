ABSTRACT This article seeks to analyze teachers&#8217; average remuneration (AR) in the public basic education networks and the ratio between their ARs and that of other professionals in the labor market, having equivalent education. The calculus was made using the Relação Anual de Informações Sociais [Annual Report of Social Information] (Rais) microdata. The results were compared with the findings of previous studies based on the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílio [National Household Sample Survey] (PNAD). In 2013, teacher&#8217;s AR was R$3,576, and that of other professionals was R$5,227, giving the ratio of 0.68. Thus, teachers found themselves in an unfavorable situation. We also observed the comparative advantages of AR calculated by Rais in relation to Pnad in the validity, reliability, population coverage and territorial desegregability aspects.

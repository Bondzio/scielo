Based on post-structuralism's proposition, adopted by Scott, that "meanings are not fixed in a culture's lexicon", the present article aims to discuss the meanings of two medieval Spanish words - cuerpo and carne - in hagiographic texts written by Gonzalo of Berceo in the first half of the century XIII, Vida de Santo Domingo de Silos and Vida de Santa Oria, from the gender category perspective. We want to verify as this category is articulated to Berceo's conceptions about the body and the flesh, looking for ambiguities and conflicts.

In this article we aim to reconstruct some of the main meanings that acquired the first practices recognized as "feminist" from an approach to their (dis) articulations with other female practices. Holding an anti-essentialist, relational and radical conception of identity formation, our analysis focuses at the reading of two textual corpuses of the activists early in the century. We analyze the discourse of the anarchists from the newspaper: "The Voice of Women" and the doctoral thesis of Elvira Lopez, defended in 1901 and entitled: "The feminist movement. First steps of feminism in Argentina"

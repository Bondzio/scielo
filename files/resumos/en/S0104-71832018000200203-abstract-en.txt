Abstract A complex backdrop of relations characterizes the border between Brazil and French Guiana, kept by the Oiapoque River and inhabited by 7,000 Indians. Habituated to continuous displacements to the major regional urban centres, the Indigenous Peoples of Oiapoque have a long history of interaction with population clusters of Brazilians, creoles and Saramak√°. Because of this, karipuna families, galibi-kali&#8217;na, galibi-marworno and palikur inhabit the village and the city, moving between them and providing new knowledges to the regional shamanism that revitalize and transform practices and shamanic ideologies in dialogue with similar forms from the other side of the territorial and/or symbolic borders. This article seeks to clarify ethnographically this field of relations and discuss the presence of mediation forms that emerge in the borders (between subjects, ritual practices, territories, etc.), proposing reflect about the transformations of regional shamanism and the new varieties that it have been taking.

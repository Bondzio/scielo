Abstract: According to UN Women, public policies aimed at reducing gender inequalities tend to be more effective when based on the human rights framework, with a view to linking politics and economy, widening the concept of work and rescuing the principle of universality Although this strategy can potentially function for multilateral institutions and States, it is insufficient for the construction of feminist movement agendas. Using references such as feminist and ecological economics in the construction of collective alternatives, these feminist movements constitute political subjects that co-construct political policy with the aim of reverting inequalities.

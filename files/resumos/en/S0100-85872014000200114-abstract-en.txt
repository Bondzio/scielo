This study aims to explore how recent literature has interpreted the electoral and                organizational failure of Catholic confessional parties throughout Argentina's                history. We know that Latin America is a region marked by Catholicism as a religious                event as well as a cultural and political phenomenon, visible through the                institutionalized incursion of religious actors in political discussions in Brazil                and the importance of Christian Democracy in the electoral field of many countries in                the region. Despite this, Catholic confessional parties are irrelevant in the                electoral and parliamentary arena in Argentina. To understand the Argentine case, I                examined the recent literature on this phenomenon and surveyed the results of                Catholic parties in Argentina from 1914 to the present.

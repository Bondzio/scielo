The aim of this article is to redress the under theorisation of the knowledge economy by sociologists and to identify the implications of the analysis developed here for education. The chapter starts by distinguishing between and accounting for the different explanations of the role of knowledge in the knowledge economy, it then argues that connections can be made between these two conceptions of knowledge and the knowledge economy though the concept of epistemic cultures (Cetina, 1999). It then concludes by considering the implications of epistemic cultures for education.

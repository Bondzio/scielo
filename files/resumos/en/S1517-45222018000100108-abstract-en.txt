Abstract This communication provides epistemic guidance from the works of Brazilian anthropologist Darcy Ribeiro (1922-1997) and Argentinian philosopher Enrique Dussel (1934-) - each of them an authoritative voice for a viable project of decolonization of scientific and philosophical knowledge, &#8216;within&#8217; and &#8216;from&#8217; Latin America. We draw on some of these scholar&#8217;s original theses and analytical frameworks, as well as on their dialogue with their respective sources, in order to propose a discussion between their thoughts, at both a theoretical and a utopian level, regarding an emancipatory and autonomous Latin American project. Thus, we try to demonstrate the complementarity as to the intentions as well as to the epistemic problems, between the Darcyan and Dusselian perspectives, going beyond the Eurocentric model, through a pluriversal approach in the production of the knowledge, that is advocated as necessary also in the contemporary theoretical debate.

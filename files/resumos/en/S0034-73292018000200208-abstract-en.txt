Abstract This article seeks to re-appraise the transformation of America&#8217;s international role and its influence on the transformation of the 20th century&#8217;s global order. It focuses on a re-appraisal of US aspirations to construct a &#8220;Pax Americana&#8221; and their impact on an unprecedented peace system that was first conceptualised after 1918 but only consolidated after 1945: the cold war&#8217;s transatlantic peace order. Yet my analysis also highlights important distinctions between American conceptions and behaviour vis-Ã -vis Europe and the superpower&#8217;s more hierarchical and often neo-imperialist approaches to &#8220;global order&#8221; and other regions during the cold war, including East Asia and Latin America.

This article organizes a debate about the young adult literary production associated to mass production. Thus, the article has the double objective of conceptualizing the best-sellers and tracing the historic lines of connection of the contemporary production with the presence of European and American books in Brazilian edition since the 19th century. The formation of a Brazilian national literary space was marked by the importing of classics of world literary heritage, travel and adventure romances, sentimental narratives and fairy-tales guided by the transatlantic circulation of the offer and the mass consumption. The criteria established for the analysis of the writer Thalita Rebou√ßas&#8217; series, which focus on the national best-seller phenomenon today. These criteria supports the argument that the young adult book when following the logic of world culture circulation makes use of a thematic return to the past, reinventing itself by making the old a novelty.

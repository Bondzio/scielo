The paper aims at exploring how the connections established in the youngsters&#8217; spheres of sociability affect their educational trajectories, either provoking changes or strengthening their initial orientation. It deals as well as with the discussion related to the extent in which situations of crisis can affect their relation with those connections and, consequently, the course of their educational development. Although limited to a single school, the study found heterogeneity among respondents in terms of their individual attributes and the socioeconomic and cultural dimensions characterizing them, factors that influence the educational trajectories. However, young people were identified with similar socioeconomic and cultural conditions, but with distinct trajectories. In these cases, the differences found can be explained by the relationship established with connections in spheres of sociability and the ways in which crisis situations were dealt with.

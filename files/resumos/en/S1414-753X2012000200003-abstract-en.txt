The analysis places local producers in relation to the ecological market and agents of sustainable development. The study covers 49 localities of the Amazon flooded forest, with information obtained between 1991 and 2006. The analysis identifies the social agents who integrate the socio environmental field constructed with social environmental intervention policies.

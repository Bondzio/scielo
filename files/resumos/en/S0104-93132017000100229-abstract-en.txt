Abstract This article analyses a first moment in the construction of a government case about Haitian mobility in Brazil, when, in early 2011, the category &#8220;Haitians&#8221; becomes mobilized alongside words like &#8220;flow&#8221;, &#8220;problem&#8221;, &#8220;issue&#8221;. Through the observation of a variety of documents (official letters, ministerial reports, informative reports of religious organizations), which maps the communication of actors and agencies localized in the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Acre, and in the Federal District, the article discusses efforts to qualify and frame a new mobility, as well as humanitarian activity and the attempts control migration. The article suggests that these discourses and actions delineate a governmental object, a problem to be managed, and zones of intervention.

Abstract In spite of the irrefutable importance of Niklas Luhmann for the human and social sciences, translations into Portuguese of his work are quite rare, most of these aimed at legal studies. Among efforts to cover this gap, we highlight the publication of Sistemas Sociais: esbo√ßo para uma teoria geral, one of the author's main works, originally published in 1984, whose translation into Portuguese presents a high level of quality in dealing with the intricate Luhmannian conceptual framework.

AbstractThis article explores the relationship between sociopolitical integration and subjective well-being in two cities. Four dimensions of integration are considered: social cohesion, social capital, relationship between government and citizenship, and quality of life. The results show the forms of sociopolitical integration influence or modulate the association, internationally accepted, of happiness with different variables. That means that contexts of communities matter in determining subjective well-being. These contexts explain the heterogeneity of behavior or variability regarding happiness. However, there are associations that are confirmed beyond the specific contexts.

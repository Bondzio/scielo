The production of feminist publications should be understood as a direct political action, and not as only another means of divulgation of the activities developed by the organizations. Those publications contribute to the refinement and renewal of the political discourse about the female condition. The feminist organizations should understand that, in operational and practical terms, what serves as a guideline for the commercial publishers can also be part of the feminist movement's guidelines for its editorial work. Today the organizations have accumulated experience but the amount of resources available is smaller. Such a framework demands new strategies.

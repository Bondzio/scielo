ABSTRACT The core proposition of the present article is to analyze Marcus Garvey&#8217;s (1887-1940) reception in Brazil. The assessed press media showed that the famous Jamaican black leader was addressed in different fashions; the mainstream papers did not highlight his visitation and, eventually, even refer to him in a controversial and sensationalist way. Papers of the so-called black press described Garvey as a &#8220;black icon&#8221;, and addressed him through a distinctive and laudatory perspective.

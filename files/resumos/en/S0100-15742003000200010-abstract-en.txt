Consultants and those who implement continued training programs or courses that aim to change knowledges and practices have the premise that, by offering content and working on the professional's reasoning process, changes in attitudes and practices will result from mastering of new knowledge. This conception is very limited and does not correspond to what goes on in these training processes. Knowledge is or is not incorporated, according to complex processes that are not just cognitive, but socio-affective-cultural. This is one of the reasons why so many programs that aim to bring about changes in knowledges, in practices, and in attitudes prove to be ineffective. The purpose of this article is to analyze under what conditions professional and personal changes could occur as a result of an in-service training program for teachers. The Proformação program, developed by Ministry of Education, is used as a case for analysis. This program aims to provide training for teachers working in the lesser developed regions of the country, who teach in elementary schools (first to fourth grades) without any formal training in education.

Abstract This article aims to expose and discuss some of the tactics and strategies adopted by undocumented Paraguayans to access health through SUS in Brazil. Field research was carried out specifically between the Paraguayan city of Pedro Juan Caballero and the Brazilian city of Ponta Por√£. Another objective is to discuss the sociocultural relations of identity that these tactics and strategies engender and opportunize in the border area in question. With regard to tactics and strategies, we list Michel de Certeau&#8217;s theoretical conceptions of these categories. Fredrik Barth and his concepts concerning ethnic groups emphasize our analysis of the diverse and sometimes divergent ethnic identities arising from the interrelationships established in the dynamics that give rise to tactics and strategies in terms of access to health, On the border of Brazil and Paraguay.

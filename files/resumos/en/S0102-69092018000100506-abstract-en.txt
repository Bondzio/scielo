The aim of the current article is to analyze the aspects of the Feijoada Dogma, which was a movement launched by black movie directors and audio-visual professional in SÃ£o Paulo, who, since the late 1990s, advocated for the need of giving new meanings and representations to Afro descendants in the Brazilian movie industry. Based on the Feijoada Dogma manifesto, from 2000, which was written by Jeferson De, the movement had the goal to produce films about the race issue and to develop a concept of &#8220;Brazilian black movie industry&#8221;. It led to controversy in the cinematographic field, although it did not stop influencing the contemporary production of self-declared Afro-Brazilian movie makers.

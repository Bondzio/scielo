This article aims to examine some of the experiences implemented at the mid level and to highlight elements that can contribute to their interpretation as well as the formulation of policies to support and guide the schools. First, the centrality of mid level education to the body of educational reforms is examined, the nature of these reforms in the context of the changing role of the State and issues referring to training in general and of professionals. The second part is dedicated to an examination of some concepts of reform and of innovation and a description and analysis of reports of experiences and trails of innovations realized by mid level schools. These are reports presented by state public schools which participated in the first phase of the Program to Improve and Expand Mid level Teaching of the SÃ£o Paulo State Department of Education in 2000 and 2001. The reports presented, with the exception of those that refer to managing the application of financial resources distributed by the program, refer to trials of innovations realized by schools prior to their connection to the program.

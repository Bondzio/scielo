Abstract: The 2014 Brazilian elections were the first in which it was compulsory to identify original sources of financial funds transferred by the parties to the candidates. This article compares the profiles of the candidates for federal deputy benefited by direct and indirect corporate donations (in which the parties intermediated the relationship between companies and candidates). The research question is: how do determinants of electoral financing that literature considers important operate in both types of donation? The central idea, which unfolds in five hypotheses, is that in both types of donations, although for different reasons, the determinants of electoral financing operate in a similar way. Such determinants have both political (electoral capital, belonging to the government&#8217;s base and size of the party) and individual nature (sex, skin color, and schooling) and are the independent variables of this research. The dependent variable is the amount of money earned by the candidates. We collected data from the TSE&#8217;s Electoral Data Repository. Using a multiple linear regression model, we conclude that direct and indirect corporate financing benefit candidates with the same profile. Thus, the intermediation of the parties does not democratize the distribution of corporate resources.

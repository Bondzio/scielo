Abstract: Focused on conflicts related to gender relations that occur at public schools in the state of Rio de Janeiro, this paper aims to contrast the visibility of gender relations in the public sphere with the invisibility that this issue gets in schools routine. Several conflicts that occur at schools and are classified as &#8220;discipline problems&#8221; are often associated with sexual discrimination practices that manifest themselves as a constituent part of the school sociability. Based on the description of cases of gender conflicts, it seeks to show the agents involved, the discourses mobilized and the institutional forms in which they were managed by the school`s staff. The data presented are derived from a research conducted in different public schools in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in which school activities were accompanied from fieldwork and participant observation.

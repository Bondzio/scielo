Abstract Departing from the nexus between gender and materiality we take money as an aesthetic object in order to elicit the relationality of the male funk person. We bring to the fore money as adornment, as articulator of relations and as substance. Woman, in some accounts described as being objectified, reveals the feminine powers engendering male personhood. We reconceptualize the body and the person as non-discrete entities, rethinking together the notion of "object." We also bring a new meaning to the notion of &#8220;ostentation&#8221;, avoiding a moralizing approach to consumption.

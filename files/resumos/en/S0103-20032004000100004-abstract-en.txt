The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize different groups of homogeneous microregions concerning cattle breeding and agriculture modernization in Minas Gerais State. In order to achieve it, the factorial analysis techniques and the grouping analysis were used to obtain the factors reflecting the technological standard, factors whose relations enable to organize groups of similar microregions. Ten different groups of homogeneous microregions were identified, and each of them has its own combination of such factors, reflecting its technological level. The groups found in the study constitute preliminary information for localized application of support policies to the sector, as well as for decisions to be made by private initiative agents.

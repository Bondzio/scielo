Abstract &#8220;Citizenship&#8221; is a complex concept. It is usually considered as an individual&#8217;s relationship to a nation-state, the duties, obligations and rights that come with residence in a given polity. However, historically, &#8220;citizenship&#8221; was concerned with the community or city state, the word (from civis) implies this. This paper argues that this local vision of the concept is still vitally important and one&#8217;s emotional links to larger institution are usually stronger with the local community than with the nation, especially in countries such as Brazil where national feelings were never strong.

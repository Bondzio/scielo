AbstractThe issue of invisibility Guarani in Rio Grande do Sul is based on a set of elements that permeate the history of these people in different ways. Among these stand out narratives produced by non-Indians and with recurring visions and idealized whose expressions regarding the gaucho folklore. In recent years, however, indigenous perspectives become part of the meanings about this past and question the Guarani invisibility in Rio Grande do Sul. These are the films produced by the Collective Mbya-Guarani Film / Video in the Villages. Throughout this text we want to propose an analysis between myth, cultural diversity and education, based on these representations about the missionary past, driven from the Archaeological Site of St. Michael the Archangel and Sep√© Tiaraju figure.

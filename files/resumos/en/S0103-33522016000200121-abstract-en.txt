Abstract The environmental conflicts related to extractive projects are increasing in Latin America as there is an increasing incentive to the extraction and exportation of commodities. In this context, the contentious actions are based on a frame that brands a common condition among those who are affected by mining, oil, and others extractive projects. It opens a specific contentious process that assembles certain actors, repertoires, and claims, which constitute a legal mobilization dynamic. This paper presents a characterization of the actors, repertoires and insurgents frames of mobilizations of people affected by extractive activities in Latin America. We are present an explanation based on macro aspects, but with emphasis on micro-sociological elements. The research raised cases of various countries, using a qualitative approach with analysis of documentary materials and participant observation.

ABSTRACT The article reflects on how much current consumption is removed from the requirements of the ecosystem, creating enormous challenges in terms of civilizational reorganization. From an analysis of how consumption habits were established in contemporary society, we argue that current consumption patterns are the product of a long and slow historical process of social construction of a culture, supported by self-reproducing values, norms and standards. Thus the need for changes committed to the limits of the ecosystem, implying a revision of the values, norms, habits and practices that contributed to the establishment of the consumer society, which is what we are today.

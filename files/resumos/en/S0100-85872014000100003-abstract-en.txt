This article examines some relations between religious activism and &#34;violence&#34;. More specifically, it discusses the political-religious protagonism of both José - a worshiper from IURD - and of the church it self with regard to conflicts related to &#34;violence&#34;. While following the trajectory of José, I argue that the entanglement among religion, entrepreneurship, security and partisan politics contributes to his performance as a security agent on managing tensions and conflicts in peripheries. I look at José&#39;s networks and at an ethnography in to an Universal Church worship service in order to indicate the mimetic performances of the State power, the relation between secularism and religion as well as to locate the &#34;just war&#34; within the inter connections between the &#34;waron crime&#34; and the &#34;war between God and Evil&#34;.

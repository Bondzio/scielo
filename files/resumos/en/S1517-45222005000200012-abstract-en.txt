This work is a synthesis of the evolution of sociology in Peru since its incorporation as a university cathedra in 1896. A discourse is build in order to link to the changes that are typical of the developments of modernity in the country and, at the same time, it is supported on the theoretical debate resulting from the slow process of institutionalization of the discipline and the emergence of a higher awareness of the plurality of paradigms, methodological perspectives, and interpretive possibilities on social reality in recent years.

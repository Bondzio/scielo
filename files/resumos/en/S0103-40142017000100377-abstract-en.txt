Abstract This article assesses the way the "Negro" issue was addressed and debated by Brazilian cinema in two texts/manifestos written by filmmakers and critics associated with the Cinema Novo: David Neves and Orlando Senna. On one hand, the reasoning of these authors is similar as they establish that the Cinema Novo redefined the representation of black people in Brazilian films; on the other hand, however, they disagree with regard to the meaning of such definition. Thus, the aim of this article is to draw a comparative analysis between the two first essays to deal with the black presence in the history of Brazilian cinema.

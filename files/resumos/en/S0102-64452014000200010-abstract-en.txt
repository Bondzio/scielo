This article concerns the struggle between two transnational advocacy networks about LGBTI people's rights in Uganda from the mid 1990s to the approval of the Ugandan "anti-homosexuality legislation". Drawing upon M. Keck and K. Sikkink's classical study on transnational advocacy networks, the article identifies the main actors in both networks, the scale shift in the pro-LGBTI people's rights one, their strategies, their targets, and the frames they mobilize. Finally, it indicates possible limits of Keck and Sikkink's theoretical framework, and it suggests some possible complementary approaches.

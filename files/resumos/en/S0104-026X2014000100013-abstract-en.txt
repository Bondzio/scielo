This work results from a research developed with the goals of observing and analyzing the production of bodies and subject positions of boy-students in a school curriculum. The research was developed with a fourth-year elementary class of a public school through ethnographic procedures involving the collection of information and then the application of queer analysis to such information. Queer studies and the poststructuralist branch of cultural studies were used as theoretical references. This work analyses the action of gender norms in the dichotomous constitution of male and female bodies in the researched curriculum. Boy-student bodies are produced as opposites to those considered girl-student bodies, but also as normal bodies in opposition to those considered faggot-boy-student and sissy-boy-student bodies, seen as abnormal.

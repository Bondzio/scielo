How do we take stock of affirmative action in Brazil? How should we understand the first initiatives of introduction of a legal framework that institutes affirmative action? What has been the impact of the global agenda on the domestic order? To what extent have the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Conference of Durban fostered domestic progress? What are the key challenges, dilemmas and tensions facing affirmative action? What are the possibilities and prospects for the attainment of ethnical and racial equity in Brazil? These are the key questions that inspire this paper.

Abstract An apparent paradox stalks the rise of women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; empowerment. The instrumental case for &#8220;investing in women&#8221; has been persuasively and glossily made. Yet the &#8220;business case&#8221; is primarily underpinned by feminist research framed by materialist concerns with persistent inequality rather than &#8220;unleashing potential&#8221; and with structural transformation rather than simply the incorporation of women into labour markets underpinned and sustained by inequitable and discriminatory norms and practices. I situate some of the contradictions of the current conjuncture and explore the role of critical analysis in destabilising the gender myths and conflations that characterise what I call empowerment lite.

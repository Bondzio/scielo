Abstract This article aims at explaining how the current format of partnership that characterizes the implementation of agrarian reform policies by Incra has been built over time. Proposing a dialogue between the most recent literature on institutional change and the literature on assemblage, I analyze three key moments in the rearrangement of relations between social movements and the State: democratization, the massacre of Eldorado dos Caraj√°s, and the transition to the Lula government. I conclude that the genesis of the current partnership results from a gradual process of stabilization of different assemblages that combined macro events at the national level with creative projects of different actors to solve local problems.

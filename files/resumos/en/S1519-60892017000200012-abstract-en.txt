Abstract: The analysis of some theoretical arguments in the economic writings of Pierre Bourdieu and Georg Simmel assumes the importance of the investigation on economic practices and conditions. Instead of presupposing, on one hand, that practices are a mere reflex of economic conditions and, on the other, that practices determine conditions, we adhere to the idea of mutual conditioning. In this sense, the access to prospective economic practices depend on relatively stable conditions in which the potential usage of money flourishes. The reconstruction of the works of both mentioned authors follows this path by trying to contribute to the renewal of class theory.

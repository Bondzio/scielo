Abstract Starting from the question of what the politics of new feminist materialisms could be, this article addresses the possibilities of (re-)conceptualizing the political in terms of encounters and involvedness, but not foremost as a matter of choice and decision but as &#8220;the only way you can figure you can stay alive&#8221; (Reagon, 1983). In our times of hegemonic anthropocentric rule of the political (Scott, 1999), I see important contributions of new (feminist) materialisms to the challenge of reconsidering our modes of encountering &#8220;others&#8221; (human and more-than-human), who, without necessarily playing by the rules, are nevertheless agentive forces. Acknowledging our fundamental dependency as living beings enmeshed in human and more-than-human worlds provides ethical grounds for working on modes of encountering &#8220;others&#8221; that accept and even embrace the fact that our own certainties will not remain stable in the process. I propose a reading of Judith Butler&#8217;s anti-foundationalist rethinking of humanist notions of intentionality and political agency (2011) through Karen Barad&#8217;s critique of her attribution of matter&#8217;s dynamism and historicity solely to the agency of language or culture (2007). I suggest that Butler&#8217;s rethinking of political subjectivity can be re-invigorated and sharpened, in light of Barad&#8217;s critique (2007), by revisiting Butler&#8217;s claim that matter is &#8220;a &#8216;that which&#8217; which prompts and occasions&#8221;. I argue that this confounds any clear distinction of passivity and activity, thereby enabling a transformation of our understanding of subjectivity and agency in terms of being-with and responding to the enigmatic address of the other (Basile, 2005).

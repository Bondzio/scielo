Through the use of input-output analysis and the system of national account, this paper presents new methodological insights in ways to estimate and to measure the Agribusiness GDP of a nation. The GDP of the Agribusiness is also estimated for two major complexes: a) Vegetal Products and b) Animal Products. Each of the Agribusiness complexes is divided into four components: a) input to agriculture; b) agriculture; c) agriculture based industry; and d) final distribution. Using data for the Brazilian economy it was possible to measure the GDP of Brazilian Agribusiness, which were estimated to be around 27% of the Brazilian GDP in 2000

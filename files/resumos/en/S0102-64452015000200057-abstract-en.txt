In this paper we seek to analyse one of the major actants in the agrarian reform process in Brazil: the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (Incra). In order to challenge the current literature on the formulation of policies through the state/movements relations we bring to case studies carried out in the states of Pernambuco and Par√° after 2000 embracing bureaucrats, managers, activists and beneficiaries in a network of actions. We conclude that the heterogeneity of the Institute and state as whole contributes for a new understanding of Incra as not only the executor of the agrarian reform, but as an active producer of its contemporary meanings in the country.

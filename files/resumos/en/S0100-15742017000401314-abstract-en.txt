ABSTRACT We present a pedagogic device called &#8220;Academic Tutoring&#8221;, implemented as a teaching proposal in disciplines of Pedagogy in the University Regional Center, National University of Comahue, Argentina. Centered on work around knowledge in the field of pedagogy, it comes within a line of research that we are developing on university training of teachers, focused on inquiry into daily pedagogic practices as the intra-institutional variable, making an impact on the training paths. This constitutes an academic framework and an instance of systematic training. Thus, we attempt to enable spaces for the training experience and generate better teaching interventions that provide more democratic student pathways.

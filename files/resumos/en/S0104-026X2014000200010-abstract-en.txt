In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendt's writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage the past, or a "writing" concerning something that was already done, if we agree that each body carries his/her own history and individuality, memory, feelings and emotions. In the search for the understanding of my existence I dance, I write, I weave words with frayed threads of the flower of the womb of my ancestral ones. I search my memories and in the corporeal memory I decipher the pain, I find the root of the violence, I observe the fear, I distil the happiness, I decorate the sweetness, dive in the peace and I know the freedom.

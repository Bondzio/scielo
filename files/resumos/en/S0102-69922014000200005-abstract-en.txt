This paper utilized the methods of complexity, research ethics and critical feminism, to explore universalistic, ahistorical and dichotomous discourses on gender violence that have spread in health systems. It proposes that we should reconsider the paradoxes that arise from the inclusion in the research and attention to gender violence of the "scientific" discourse of biomedicine and in response, of the return of the appropriation of women's bodies through the medicalization of the problem. Using this theoretical basis it analized the speeches that used as a simulacrum try to "solve" gender violence against women by implementing simple strategies, which in the case of Mexico have tended to fail.

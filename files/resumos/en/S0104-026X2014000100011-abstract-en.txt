In this article I write about the importance of creating alternative methodologies to work with violence against women in the field of psychology. Artistic productions like literature, theatre and storytelling, among others, make it possible to question fixed binary identities in gender regulation and may enable the reconstruction of identitary rules by means of original enunciations and gestures, which give occasion to new maps that can embrace differences and refute normalizations. I bring the possibility of thinking the insertion of the psychologist in this debate, supported by artistic devices as resistance strategies and construction of dissident subjectivities, and I illustrate this narrative bringing the story of Branca and José Pássaro Volante, characters of Lídia Jorge's work "O dia dos prodígios" (The day of the prodigies).

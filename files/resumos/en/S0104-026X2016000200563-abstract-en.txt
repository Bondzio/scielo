Abstract: In this paper we analyze the relationship between political Conditional Cash Transfer and concepts of family and gender. The thesis that we sustain is such programs betting on a heteronormative and traditional family, contrary to academics and politicians speeches about family diversity and equal gender roles. We intend, from a Latin American reading, indicate that such programs have not led to substantial progress in relation to such topics.

Abstract This article aims at understanding the facts transmitted by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo about the firearms and ammunition referendum of 2005. Searches on the newspaper&#8217;s website were conducted using the following descriptors: referendum; firearm; ammunition. The search resulted in 170 reports, which were analyzed by the Alceste software. The results indicate that the discussion surrounding the referendum was organized into two defined axes of meanings, namely private security and public security, in which themes such as the control of illegal firearms and ammunition are background issues, demonstrating the need to deepen discussions on the topic.

This article analyzes two situations of integration in the political arena. The situations were identified through qualitative research in Quilombola Territories and in Marine Extractive Reserves in the State of Pará. One situation corresponds to the constitutional judicial instrument for reparation of historical injustices, mobilizing of specific identities in mobilization to interfere in the local government of the Municipality of Salvaterra (Marajó Archipelago). The identity character of the claims and the inexistence of public spaces to negotiate them reduce the likelihood of achieving social rights. The other, known as Resex (extractive reserve) &#8211; instrument of public policy related more to social than to an identity mobilization instrument &#8211; referred in the recognition of traditional populations and their adequate know-how in relation to environmental demands. Tools such as the Deliberative Council, under certain circumstances provide favorable spaces for innovation in livelihood, economic production, involvement of local players in collective action, consequently renewing local democracy within an environmental context.

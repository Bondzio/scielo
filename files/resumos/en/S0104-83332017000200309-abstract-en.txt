Abstract The title of my article refers to one of the various hashtags that circulated [in Portuguese] on Twitter, in Brazil, reacting to the dessaparition and death of two Argentine tourists in Equador in early 2016. I will consider the conditions of production of this reaction, which is unusual in a country that for decades has paid little attention to violence against women tourists, related to the recent movement that was called the &#8220;feminist spring&#8221; in the country. Using them as a reference, I propose to explore methodological issues to be faced in studies about the relations between gender, violence and tourism. I consider the conditions that turn certain violences particularly relevant for feminisms. I then analyze the analytical tools that feminist frameworks offer to reflect on those relations.

The present study proposes a reflection, from the viewpoint of Anthropology, on the evaluation of social projects supported by international cooperation agencies. It situates international cooperation in the context of the discourse of development built on post-World War II period, and discusses the role played by projects evaluation in this area. The study then analyses the experience of evaluation, from the standpoint of Anthropology, following two strategies: the limits of the institutionalized patters by international cooperation based on logical frameworks to comprehend the context and social change, considering that the projects aim to intervene in social relationships established in the process of globalization; and the possibilities opened by fieldwork in evaluation as a space for dialog and for imparting new meaning to social change. Last, the study ponders on professional performance of Anthropologists, reaffirming the place of ethnography and theory as the base of the discipline.

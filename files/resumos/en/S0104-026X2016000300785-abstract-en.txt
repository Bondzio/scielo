Abstract: This article aims at presenting introductory aspects of the life and work of the French writer and translator Judith Gautier who is relatively unknown in Brazil. This reflection was prompted by the surprise that an article written and published by the young woman, who was 19 years old at the time, in the newspaper Le Moniteur, on March 29, 1864, produced on the French poet Charles Baudelaire. We guided our research on a letter from the author addressed to Judith on April 9, 1864. Baudelaire's reaction of surprise before the analysis of the young woman produced in him a questioning of his own prejudice, which leads us to social roles and literary spaces assigned to women and men in the Nineteenth Century.

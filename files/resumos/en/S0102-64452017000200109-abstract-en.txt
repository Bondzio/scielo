Abstract The author addresses both the conservative opposition to human rights as its liberal defense, showing that a reference to the formal-historical logic of the constitution of these rights completely reframes its role as the core of political projects. Derivationist critique of the State, which focuses on the political and legal structures as social forms of the existence of capitalist society, is mobilized to identify the historical and epistemological specificity of the lexicon and practices of human rights. Then, he points out that, to realize the content prescribed in them, their legal form of existence would have to be destroyed.

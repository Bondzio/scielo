This article aims to analyze the chain of scrap tires final destination. The analysis took place 6 years after the publication of the CONAMA resolution, which established rules and manufacturers and importers responsibilities for an ecologically adequate final destination of scrap tires. Based on the analysis that was carried out, it is possible to point out that although the actions taken and the efforts made by legally responsible companies have generated positive results with the elimination of large outdoor tire depots, the issue of scrap tires has not been resolved yet and it lacks investments in technological development to make the recycling of this material possible.

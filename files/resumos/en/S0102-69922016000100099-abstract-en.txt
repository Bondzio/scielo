Black women have long occupied marginal positions in academic settings. I argue that many Black female intellectuals have made creative use of their marginality - their "outsider within" status - to produce Black feminist thought that reflects a special standpoint on self, family, and society. I describe and explore the sociological significance of three characteristic themes in such thought: 1. Black women's self-definition and self-valuation; 2. the interlocking nature of oppression; and 3. the importance of Afro-American women's culture. After considering how Black women might draw upon these key themes as outsiders within to generate a distinctive standpoint on existing sociological paradigms, I conclude by suggesting that other sociologists would also benefit by placing greater trust in the creative potential of their own personal and cultural biographies.

This study aims to explore how international public opinion perceives the main options for solving the climate change issue, technological innovations or lifestyle changes, and in what way contextual forces help to understand the prevailing choice among the publics. Research is based on random-effects, pooled time series data panel for 15 countries across 3 times points between 2007 and 2011, compiling public opinion survey data and macro-level data. Results indicate favoritism for a technology fix, especially among developing societies. However, such option is gradually losing ground and the belief in individual behavior changes is increasing. Structural, institutional and environmental forces play a role in shaping perceptions in such a way that less favorable environmental conditions coupled with higher human and institutional development motivate lower reliance in technological solutions.

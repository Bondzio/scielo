Abstract This article is an unpublished and unfinished work written by Brasilmar Ferreira Nunes, who died in April 2016. The purpose of his reflections is to show how the new and intimate association between urban planning, urbanism and architecture has been prominent in the metropolis. Especially those in the East and Middle East, regions of the globe where, for strategic and economic reasons, capitalism has been consolidating in a hegemonic way. Recognizing the important analytical contribution of Brasilmar Nunes, Christiane Girard introduces it, highlighting traces of the trajectory of this sociologist who influenced both his academic production. Norma Lacerda, in turn, ends by drawing attention to the novelty of the text and commenting on the diversity of themes addressed by it.

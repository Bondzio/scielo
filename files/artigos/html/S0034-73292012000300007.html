Climate change has not only produced negative influences on   the global environmental system, it has also brought serious challenges to the   survival and development of human society, which has not only affected the daily   lives of human beings but has also caused major natural catastrophes and damage   around the world. In a report released by the World Wildlife Fund in 2009,   global sea level is predicted to rise by more than one meter before 2100. The   rise in sea level is expected to produce inundation in coastal areas and island   countries, influencing about one-fourth of global population. In the Stern   Review published by the British Royal Society in 2006, former chief economist   of the World Bank, Sir Nicholas Stern, warned that global warming would produce   negative consequences for the world economy. If effective action is not adopted   within the next decade, the expected economic cost may surpass the sum of the   total cost of the great wars and the Great Depression. The same report further   points out that the total cost and risk of climate change is equal to the   annual loss of at least 5% GDP in the global economy (ibid., vi).</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Redefining national security</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, since the   release of <i>Silent Spring</i> brought the world's attention to the issue of environmental protection   and sustainable development (Carson 1962), in <i>The Limits     to Growth</i>, Donella Meadows et al. (2004) further point out that   limitations to the global biosphere will have major consequences on global   development. Meadows et al. think that governments and citizens around the   world should adopt the approach of sustainable development towards the limits   to growth and bring about ways for the global society to move towards   sustainability. Coincidentally, around the same time, the United Nations held   the Conference on Human and Environment (UNCHE) and the first oil crisis broke   out in the Middle East, which exposed the effects and influences of energy   shortage and environmental degradation on national security. These developments   have guided more international attention to issues of non-traditional security.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Due to its comprehensive, permeating and potentially   uncorrectable effects (IPCC 2007, 3), climate change is considered to be one of   the most challenging global issues facing human beings today. In addition, the   exploration of the effects of climate change on international and national   security became a new popular research topic.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> In 1983, Richard   Ullman openly criticized US definition of national security during the Cold War   period to be "very narrow" and "extremely militarized," which resulted in the   over-militarization of US foreign policy and Washington's ignorance of threats   to other countries' national security. Ullman (1983) points out that resource   competition and transnational migration that comes with population increase in   developing countries may give rise to severe conflicts. In 1993, Mahbub ul-Haq   (1999, 79) attempted to describe a new concept of human security, which is not   only homeland security but people's security; not only security realized   through military power but security realized through development; not only   national security but individual security; not only the home, street, work,   society and environment but the security of people anywhere.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Accordingly, the Human Development Report released by   the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1994 clearly established the   definition of "human security," which covers political, economic, food, health,   environmental, personal and collective security (UNDP 1994). The report "A More   Secure World: Our Shared Responsibility" proposed by the High-Level Panel on   Threats, Challenges and Change to the UN Secretary General in 2004 also points   out environmental degradation as an important challenge to international   security (UN 2004). It is apparent that global climate change has become an   important factor that influences national security today.</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Challenges and responses</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2006, the Oxford Research Group released the report <i>Global Responses to Global   Threats: Sustainable Security for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</i>, which   analyzes the security impact of climate change and proposes corresponding   response measures. The report points out that: (1) climate change may   cause serious natural challenges and food crises while forcing human beings to   move away from coastal and delta regions &#150; these challenges would bring about   harm, social instability and changes in lifestyle; (2) the severity,   sustainability and destructiveness of climate change challenges will far   surpass international terrorism; and (3) the increasing use of nuclear   energy should not be the strategy adopted in response to climate change, as the   action would only exacerbate the spread of nuclear technology in an unstable   world and increase the potential of rogue states or extremist groups acquiring   such technology (Abbott, Rogers and Sloboda 2006, 7).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2008, the Oxford Research Group released the report <i>An Uncertain Future: Law   Enforcement, National Security and Climate Change</i>, which points out   that climate change would become a threat against the United Kingdom within the   next decade. According to the report, as the issue of climate change continues   to worsen, increasing temperature would cause an increase in sea level and   changes in global climate, which would in turn lead to the damage of public   facilities, shortage of resources and large-scale migration of human beings.   The world would then face the pressure of several million environmental   refugees. Peoples forced away from their homes due to natural disaster would inevitably   contribute to social and international instability and regional and ethnic   conflicts. The country is advised to carry out tighter border security controls   to reduce the production of carbon dioxide (Abbott 2008).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In short, the impact of climate change is global.   Besides an understanding of the potential impacts of climate change, a proposal   of effective response to the consequences is critical. Moreover, in the sudden   outbreak of negative events caused by climate change, limitations on the supply   of food, water and energy may be first expressed through economic, political   and diplomatic means such as the negotiation of treaties and sanction on trade.   In the entire process, conflict over territory and water may become even more   severe. As states threatened by such crises become ever desperate for scarce   resources, the level of conflict can be expected to rise as well (Schwartz and   Randall 2003, 14&#150;15). This is the reason that national security is ever   becoming the main concern of discussions on climate change.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The influence of climate change on China's national   security</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In recent years, oddities in global climate have   caused China to be swamped by natural disasters. As a country with great   population, relatively low economic development, vulnerable regional biosphere   and complicated climate conditions, China is particularly susceptible to the   influences of climate change. Not only has China surpassed the US to become the   biggest energy (coal) consuming state in the world, it has also become the biggest   producer of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide (Hu and Yan 2010, 29). According   to a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), if effective   measures are not adopted soon, by 2030, the amount of pollutants produced by   China will be twice the total amount of pollutants produced by OECD countries   (Bustelo 2007).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">China's leadership is concerned about climate change   because of the potential influences of climate change on national development   (Marks 2010, 972). Zeng et al. (2008, 730&#150;731) predict that as a result of   climate change, China will face various challenges including melting glacier,   especially in Tibet and Tianshan; loss in agricultural production, which may   decrease as much as 10% by 2030 (Bustelo 2007); increasing number of droughts,   storms, floods and natural disasters caused by extreme climate; rising sea   level that will affect as many as 67 million people (Heggelund 2007, 167);   and the exposure of another 40% of the world's population to the threat of   natural disaster (The Economist 2008). Taking into account that China harbors a   massive population of 1.3 billion people, decreasing resources, severe   pollution problems and a fast-growing economy &#150; factors of a typical   development dilemma &#150;, the potential cost of climate change for China is   exceedingly high (Heggelund 2007, 158, 165).</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vulnerability and potential conflict</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding the influence of climate change on China's   national security, one of the earliest studies can be traced to the report <i>An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario     and Its Implications for United States National Security</i> released by   the US Pentagon in 2003. Unreleased to the public until 2004, the report points   out that in the period 2010&#150;2020, as China's food production needs to respond   to a fast-growing population, reduced reliability of stable rain conditions   will have major consequences. Reduced occurrence of the cycle of evaporation   and cooling of water vapor will result in the extension of cold winters and   increasingly warm summers. As rainfall decreases, problems of water and energy   supply can be expected to become worse. A hungry China will covet the resources   of Russia and other countries to its western border while large-scale famine   may cause chaos and international conflict (Schwartz and Randall 2003, 13).   Accordingly, the report predicts that before 2030, China will become involved   in many international conflicts as a result of negative consequences brought on   by global climate transformations (ibid., 15&#150;19).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following the Pentagon report, the <i>Climate Change as a Security Risk</i> report issued by the German Advisory Council on Global Change in 2007 succeeded   the analysis of the influences of climate change on China's national security.   The report considers China as a country deeply influenced by climate change.   Climate change will result in melting glacier, land degradation, reduction in   agricultural land, fresh-water shortage, extreme weather events, prolongation   of drought and increased sea level in China. Although these issues have   different degrees of impact on different regions, existent biospheric and   social problems can be expected to intensify, with the final consequence of   negative impacts on China's economic vitality and political stability. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report further points out that an important   characteristic of contemporary Chinese society is the developmental gap among   regions, with ethnic minority communities established in the least developed   areas of China, making up approximately 60% of the country's territory. Inhabitants   of these areas mainly rely on agriculture; these regions are particularly   susceptible to the influences of melting glacier, desertification and   deforestation. Such environmental issues have become the main factors   contributing to conflicts among different ethnic groups in recent years.   Furthermore, the migration of Chinese nationals to neighboring countries such   as Russia and Mongolia and environmental issues that have arisen as a result of   resource development activities have both contributed to diplomatic friction   between China and its neighbors (German Advisory Council on Global Change 2007,   146&#150;149).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, the joint study report <i>The Age of Consequences: The   Foreign Policy and National Security Implications of Global Climate Change</i> sponsored by the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) and the Center for   Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) also analyzes the potential   influences of climate change on China's national security. The joint study   points out that the fast increase of greenhouse gases can be traced to China's   coal-based energy structure (Zhang 2008, 81; Lewis 2007/2008, 157). The use of   coal not only serves as a long-term threat against the global environment but   also exacerbates existent environmental problems in China such as desertification,   water shortage and deterioration of air quality (Campbell et al. 2007,   61&#150;62). The report notes that a source of conflict originates from migration   that is stimulated due to environmental issues. In China, this type of   migration is usually demonstrated as the movement from rural to urban areas and   adds to the pressure of population overload in cities. Also, the migration of   people to regions of more rainfall in China is also consequential. For example,   the movement of Han people in China's interior to Xinjiang to look for work has   engendered national conflict and inter-ethnic competition over resources and   work between Han workers and local Uyghurs (Campbell et al. 2007, 62&#150;63).</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">China's climate risk</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Climate change brings about serious challenges against   national security. In terms of China, one can notice the following challenges:<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a></font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A.        Territorial size and soil quality: climate change     has caused rising sea level and retreating coastline, causing parts of China's     land territory to be under water, with coastal areas facing stronger potential     threats. Furthermore, climate change has increased the speed of soil     degradation in China. For example, desertification has decreased the living space     of Chinese people, which entails threats against the security of China's     biosphere, sustainable development of the Chinese economy and survival of the     Chinese ethnicity (Zhang 2010, 21&#150;27).</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B.        Fresh water:<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> in terms of China's     water resource, not only does the country incur shortage, but the distribution     among regions is unequal. Increased economic development has made the issue of     water security stand out. Increased temperature level or reduced rainfall has     caused changes in the flow and route of rivers. At the same time, climate     change has also caused glacial retreat. In the short run, increasing glacial     retreat can cause river runoff to increase. However, with the large-scale     shrinking of glaciers, both glacial and river runoff are bound to decrease,     which not only reduces the supply of water resource but also undermine the     balancing function provided by runoff. The consequence of such event is the     chain reaction of deteriorating water resource, biosphere and the environment.     In short, climate change further exacerbates China's existent vulnerability in     water resource.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C.        Food production: climate change increases     instability in agricultural production and causes disturbances to agricultural     development. Major adjustments in agricultural production structure and     planning, including plantation period and crop species, can be expected to     incur as a result of climate change. At the same time, negative effects of     drought and high temperature may intensify as well, incurring additional     agricultural losses. These are all factors that may greatly increase     agricultural cost.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D.        Increased frequency and strength of extreme climate     events: climate change increases the water cycle and alters the regional     distribution and strength of rainfall, which may in turn give rise to extreme     climate events such as flood, drought, snow storm and typhoon. Increased     frequency and strength of climate events may incur great losses for human     property and living conditions (IPCC 2007).</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">E.        Governmental challenges: climate change has caused     China to face ever-increasing international and domestic pressures;     self-autonomy of the government is reduced and Beijing's governing ability is     further challenged. Even though China has adopted a series of measures towards     energy conservation, high-speed economic development and an energy consumption     structure based on coal have caused China to obtain a high level of carbon dioxide     emission and face growing international pressure on the reduction of emission.     In addition, the great increase in China's comprehensive power has lowered the     global recognition of China as a developing country while increasing the     expectation and demand for Beijing to take a more active role in the     international community. More importantly, climate change has already caused     major challenges to Beijing's governing ability and stability of the Chinese     regime. For example, regarding a big snow storm in Southern China in 2008, both     the central and local governments' capability and authority were put under     suspicion, as local authorities failed to predict and react to the disaster     effectively.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">F.        Challenges against national defense and military     construction: climate change has increasing negative impacts on many of China's     major national defense projects such as the Three Gorges, the Green Wall of     China, water rechanneling from the south to the north, and natural gas transfer     from the west to the east. The increase in extreme climate events has also     hindered the development of the Chinese troops fighting ability while     increasing the burden of disaster relief. In 2008, China's Defense Whitepaper     listed natural disaster as a threat to national security for the first time and     pointed out that troops should retain the ability to carry out a variety of     military missions (State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of     China 2009). Besides the threat of natural disaster, many of China's missile bases     are established on tundra regions in the northwest. Both the freezing and     thawing of ice would affect the missile sites. Lastly, on a strategic level,     energy competition due to climate change may generate tension between China and     other neighboring countries, increasing the chances for local military     conflicts.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>China's response to climate change</b></font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Basic principles and policy guidelines</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding the issue of global climate change, Beijing   has publicly expressed that China would adhere to the following principles   (National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China   2007, 24&#150;26):</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A.

Based on   central institutional reforms, China established the National Climate Change   Response and Coordination Committee (guojia qihou bianhua duice xietiao xiaozu)   in 1998 and confirmed the goal of energy conservation and reduction in   greenhouse emission in the 11<sup>th</sup> Five Year Plan proposed in 2006   (Xinhua 2009). In the following year, China further established the National   Leading Committee on Climate Change and released the National Climate Change   Programme (Zhu 2010, i), the first state policy document on climate change that   discusses China's comprehensive strategy against climate change before 2010 and   mid-term reduction target for greenhouse gas emission (National Development and   Reform Commission 2007; Qin 2009, 252). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2009, China passed the Environmental Impact   Assessment Act. As a responsible developing power, Beijing recognizes the   importance of climate change and advocates joint response through effective   international cooperation (The Central People's Government of the PRC 2009). In   the same year, the progress report on climate change released by China's   National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) points out that the Chinese   government is "deeply cognizant of the complexity and extensive influence of   &#91;climate change&#93; issues and fully aware of the arduousness and urgency of the   task of addressing climate change" and "is determined to address climate change   in the process of pursuing sustainable development" (National Development and   Reform Commission 2009, 1).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, it is worth noting Beijing seems to take an   ambiguous approach towards the issue of climate change. In the 12<sup>th</sup> Five Year Plan released in 2010, China openly commits itself to the goals of   reducing energy use and carbon dioxide emission as active responses to global   climate change.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a> Despite the commitment, in the climate   change conference in Canc&uacute;n in 2010, the Chinese government expressed its hope   that developed and developing countries should shoulder their respective duties   and obligations and actively respond to climate change based on the principle   of "common but differentiated responsibilities." China will make its greatest   effort in realizing the dual objectives of economic growth and reduced energy   consumption (Xinhua 2010).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall, China seeks to attain a balance: under the   condition that economic development is not suffered, reduce the negative   impacts of climate change on the domestic economy. On the world stage, China   holds to the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities," and   advocates that states should carry out their duties and obligations. For   example, international cooperation is critical in the carbon collection and   exploitation and the development of relevant storage technology. As developing   states cannot rely on their own strength to perform such tasks, support from   developed states in this case is particularly important. Accordingly, China has   made the following suggestions: (1) further exploit the Carbon   Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) as an interface for multilateral   collection; (2) investigate into the development of a global funding   mechanism for carbon sequestration; and (3) developed countries should   take the lead in making contributions to the initiative based on its   advantages.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Domestically, in order to achieve the important goal   of reduced emission without impairing economic growth, China has adopted the   development model so-called "low-carbon economy." Such aspirations can be   garnered from official documents and talks by China's political elites. On   various occasions, Chinese elites have proposed energy conservation, reduction   in greenhouse emission and low-carbon economy as important goals in state   development. China seeks to realize the "scientific development concept" (kexue   fazhanguan), establish a resource-conserving, environmental-friendly society   and promote the so-called "cycling investment."<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In short, it is clear that China's main objective is   to reduce the serious challenges of climate change while maintaining the   country's economic development. Beijing holds steadfastly to the principle that   China is a developing state and, as such, should be differentiated from   developed states; developing and developed states should have different   responsibilities. Although China is the biggest producer of carbon dioxide and   sulfur dioxide, Beijing's political elites have expressed that the country will   take care of its duties and obligations in the fight against climate change,   and make great efforts towards the realization of economic growth and reduced   greenhouse gas emission.</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">China's actions against climate change</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to mitigate the impact of global climate   change on national security, China has adopted a variety of policies to   accomplish the priority of combating climate change while maintaining economic   development. China's adoption of low carbon economy is a typical example of   such moves.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concept of "low-carbon economy" was first   introduced by Gareth Thomas and Stewart Boyle in their work <i>At the Energy Crossroads: Policies     for a Low Carbon Economy</i>. Thomas and Boyle (2001) point out that the   gradual move away from fossil fuels and onto the path towards a low-carbon   economy is the only answer towards the development of renewable energy. Since   then, the concept was further recognized in the Bali Action Plan of 2007 and   established as the theme of the World Environment Day in 2008 &#150; Kick the Habit!   Towards a Low Carbon Economy (United Nations Environment Programme 2008). The   main objective of low-carbon economy is the mitigation of climate change   effects and promotion of sustainable development through technological and   institutional innovations. Low-carbon economy is an economic development model   that aims to facilitate the transition from a high-energy to a low-energy era   by improving energy efficiency, promoting the innovation of low-carbon products   and maintaining global environmental balance.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to the policy suggestions of low-carbon   economy, China adopted the following actions with the goal of reducing the   influence of climate change on national security. First, in terms of mitigating   the effects of climate change, China took the issues of structural adjustment   and mode of development into account, and adopted actions such as the   advancement of industrial structure, promotion of cycling investment, increase   in energy efficiency, promotion of energy-conserving products, reduction of   greenhouse gas emission by the agricultural industry and promotion of green   plantation (National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic   of China 2009, 9&#150;27). Specifically, in terms of increasing forest carbon sinks,   China carried out the "san-Bei" (xibei, huabei, dongbei, or literally the   northwest, north and northeast regions) Green Wall project, with the goal of   establishing a series of human-planted forest strips to prevent desertification   of the region from worsening (National Development and Reform Commission of the   People's Republic of China 2010, 23; The Central People's Government of the PRC   2010). In addition, China has also actively promoted the growing of trees in   urban areas in order to facilitate the establishment of natural obstacles for   environmental protection (National Development and Reform Commission of the   People's Republic of China 2010, 26).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Second, in terms of adjustment actions towards climate   change, China actively seeks to strengthen the adjustment ability of the   agricultural industry, forest and other natural systems and coastal and other   vulnerable regions. China responds to the following issues:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A.        Unstable food production: in response to the     effects of climate change on agriculture such as instability in food     production, changes in agricultural planning and production structure and     increased cost, China has established a series of policies catered towards     adjustment of the agricultural industry towards climate change, including     Drought Control Regulation of the People's Republic of China, Conservation     Tillage Plan (2009&#150;2015) and Regulations on Safety of Agricultural Genetically     Modified Organisms (National Development and Reform Commission of the People's     Republic of China 2009, 20&#150;21; 2010, 31&#150;32; 2011, 8). Currently, the coverage     of improved strains of farm crops has exceeded 95 percent nationwide in China     and accounts for approximately 40 percent of increased food production in the     country (National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of     China 2011, 8).</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B.        Water shortage and uneven distribution: in order to     reduce the shortage of water and imbalanced supply among regions, China has     enacted a series of policies to strengthen the management and protection of     water resource. The Regulation on Management of Water Abstraction Licenses     enacted in 2008 strengthens the management of water resource and establishes a     water-conserving society conducive to energy conservation and reduced carbon     emissions (Republic of China 2009, 23). In February 2009, the State Department     issued the Drought Control Regulation of the PRC, which emphasizes the     strengthening of river-basin management and water-resource planning. At the     same time, China has also strengthened its hydraulic establishments. Since     2009, China has established a series of projects on flood prevention and     strengthened the ability to manage water and soil degradation, and spent three     years to complete the repair of faulty dams (National Development and Reform     Commission of the People's Republic of China 2010, 33).</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C.        Rising sea level and retreating coast line: in     2008, China established the maritime working institution responsible for     climate change tasks (National Development and Reform Commission of the     People's Republic of China 2009, 24). In 2009, China further issued a series of     laws and policies to strengthen the government's ability to use and manage the     sea. In addition, the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) makes an active effort     in monitoring changes in sea level and scale of land reclamation while     commencing restoration projects such as the planting of mangrove, protection of     coral reef and restoration of coastal wetland. At the same time, the SOA     carries out the monitoring, investigation and evaluation of rising sea level,     coastal erosion, seawater intrusion and soil salinization (National Development     and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China 2011, 9).</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D.        Frequent extreme climate events: in order to reduce     the level of damages to the life, property and lifestyle of the people caused     by extreme climate events, China's Meteorological Administration (CMA) has     initiated a series of research projects that strengthens the monitoring,     expectation and evaluation of climate change effects. The CMA has also     established the first generation system for making short term climate     predictions, developed new global climate models and begun evaluation work on     the influences of climate change on various aspects of national security     including food, water, environment and human health. China seeks to reduce the     damage by natural disasters such as snow storm and typhoon through its efforts.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">E.        Military defense and strategic projects: in     response to the threat of climate change, the People's Liberation Army (PLA)     established the climate change expert council in 2008 and strengthened the     military's research on climate change. The council has investigated into the     effect of climate change on military conflict and troop establishment and     provided advice and technical support for the PLA (Xinhua 2008).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Third, in terms of the establishment of legal   institutions, China improved environment-related laws and regulations and   refined management and working institutions. In terms of the improvement of   laws and regulations, Beijing refined and advanced regulations covering issues   such as renewable energy, cycling investment, energy conservation and land and   water protection (National Development and Reform Commission of the People's   Republic of China 2011, 10&#150;11). Furthermore, in response to the central   government's determination to fight climate change, China's 31 provinces have   established and fully realized individual plans in response to climate change.   At the same time, related departments have subsequently established action plans   and projects regarding environmental and maritime protection.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to strengthen governance ability, Beijing has   established a management and working system that is under centralized   leadership that guides the division of labor among departments and involves the   participation of different regions and industries. In 2007, Beijing established   the National Leading Committee on Climate Change with the Prime Minister   leading the committee while ministers from 20 related departments serving as   members. The National Development and Reform Commission is responsible for   carrying out the decisions of the leading committee. In 2008, the Climate   Change Department was established to provide coordination and management for   the realization of actions on climate change. In 2010, coordination and   communication offices were established under the framework of the National   Leading Committee on Climate Change to advance cooperation among the various   departments and parties involved (National Development and Reform Commission of   the People's Republic of China 2011, 11).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Onwards, in response to the compression of policy   autonomy, China actively participates in multilateral negotiations on climate   change supported by the UN such as the Bali, Copenhagen and Canc&uacute;n meetings, and   firmly stands by the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities."   China also engages in international dialogue. For example, at the Opening   Plenary Session of the 2009 UN Summit on Climate Change, Hu Jintao made a   speech titled <i>Join Hands     to Address Climate Challenge</i>. Finally, China also participates and   promotes cooperation among states. In March 2010, China issued the Interim   Measures on the Administration of External Cooperation to Address Climate   Change,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> which further standardized and promoted   international cooperation on climate change (National Development and Reform   Commission of the People's Republic of China 2011, 15&#150;19).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In sum, domestically, China adheres to the development   model of low-carbon economy and actively adopts various actions to reduce the   negative effects of climate change while balancing the goal of maintaining   steady economic development. Internationally, China actively participates in   negotiations on climate change and seeks to strengthen cooperation with other   countries. By maintaining its interest on the issue of climate change, not only   can China avoid the ever-increasing international pressure calling for the   country to take action; it can also avoid contraction of its self-autonomy in   the international community.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">China's main concern with the effects of climate   change is whether economic development can be sustained and competitiveness can   be promoted (Ma 2010, 28&#150;29). For China's political elites, economic growth is   the only path towards improved living standard and employment rate, and also   the only path towards the end of poverty. Unfortunately, China's pursuit of   economic growth and modernization is often in conflict with growing social   movements demanding action against climate change. It is a well-known fact that   the human use of fossil fuels has caused the phenomenon of global warming. The   reason that China has become the main target of accusation in terms of   pollution lies in the state's use of coal. Coal is the leading source of   "dirty" energy in the world, and China leads the world in coal production and   exploitation, with as much as 70% of its total energy consumption coming from   coal. The burning of coal leads to a large amount of carbon dioxide emission   and, in 2007, China surpassed the US to become the leading greenhouse gas   emission state in the world (ibid., 29). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on China's policies and actions towards climate   change, the authors conclude that political elites in Beijing have two main   considerations:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A.        National security interests: on the one hand,     climate change is considered to be an effect of greenhouse gas emission and     putting a limit on China's greenhouse gas emission would inevitably hinder the     country's economic development (Wiener 2008). On the other hand, climate change     also entails potential consequences for China's agricultural, food, water,     energy and environmental security. With rising temperature, extreme climate     events such as rising sea level, typhoon, flood and drought will also severely     damage the conditions for China's economic and social development, and threaten     social stability and the life and property of peoples. In order to safeguard     its own interests, China has adopted the development model of low-carbon     economy and searches for pareto optimality between economic development and     energy conservation.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B.        The role of responsible state: China must contribute     to the global battle against climate change by accepting international     responsibility and making an effort towards cooperation with other states and     reduction of carbon emission, in order to play the role of a responsible power     in the international community and correspond to the concept of harmonious     worldview (Hung and Tsai 2009, 66&#150;72; Hung and Yu 2009, 52&#150;54). In other words,     as a responsible power, China must initiate effective international cooperation     and introduce a new governing framework and model for climate change that seeks     compromise among states to adjust their consumption structure and lifestyle. At     the same time, China must make an effort towards the re-establishment of     international organizations and treaties dealing with the issue of climate     change (Tao 2009, 279).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, in spite of domestic efforts towards   combating climate change, China may continue to face the following difficulties   in the near future:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A.        Paradox between state interest and international     role: with continued deterioration of global warming and threats against human     beings caused by extreme climate events, whether China can continue to hold on     to the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" remains to be     watched. On the one hand, if China remains unwavering and unwilling to     undertake international obligations and becomes recognized by the international     community as the "culprit of global warming," not only would the benevolent     image of "responsible power" that China has worked hard to shape be severely     damaged; the country's advancement towards a global power would be challenged     as well (Tsai and Hung 2008, 80&#150;82). On the other hand, if China accepts     demands for emission reduction due to international pressure, sustainable     economic growth becomes in doubt, entailing the further consequence of a     setback on the country's rise to power. In short, China needs to find a balance     between emission reduction and sustainable growth; otherwise it would be     trapped in a growth dilemma.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">B.        The impact of international pressure on economic     development: if China turns away from international obligations on reduced     carbon emission, it can expect to receive intensified sanction and pressure     from other states, especially from developed states. For example, in 2009, the     US Congress adopted the American Clean Energy and Security Act, which     stipulates that, until 2020, the US reserves the right to extract carbon tax     from the product of states that do not set a limit for carbon emission (The     Library of Congress 2009). If the carbon tax is widely adopted around the     world, China is bound to face immense pressure in terms of emission reduction,     as exported goods would face trade protectionism disguised as environmental     barriers (Song 2009). Once again, China is put in a dilemma: on the one hand,     if China does not establish a threshold for carbon emission, its exports can be     expected to suffer. On the other hand, if China establishes a limit for     emission, the challenge may be equally as rigorous, as the state would need to     be able to realize emission reduction with sufficient capability and without     influencing economic development.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">C.        Related measures remain loose and ineffective:     although the central government has taken the lead to establish many concrete     and comprehensive policies, when policies reach the local government, not only     is the latter unable to correspond with central policies; pressure from local     elites can also undermine the effectiveness of policies. China needs to adopt     the following measures in order to produce better results: (1) strengthen     judicial ability to supervise environmental law, and (2) establish energy     laws with broader scope, more specific demands and stronger legal punishments     (Marks 2010, 983&#150;984). In other words, policy is not coordinated between the     different levels of government. Although the central government has put in     place related measures that seek to respond to the impacts of climate change     from a top-down approach, once the policy reaches the local government, the     latter may simply disregard such measures due to local economic considerations.     A particular undermining situation emerges when the local government     superficially responds to the central government's demands, a phenomenon     otherwise known as "the elites decide but the commoners can respond"     (shangyouzhengce, xiayouduice) (ibid., 984&#150;985).</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D.        Realization of low-carbon economy: since China     remains a developing state with a large population and low economic development,     rapid industrialization and urbanization will continue to exert pressure on     China to depend on energy consuming and highly-polluting industries for     economic development. Even though China has made an effort towards diversifying     its source of energy and reducing its dependence on fossil fuels, in the short     run, China's coal-based energy structure remains immovable (Council for     Economic Planning and Development 2009). China's current economic structure     exacerbates the question of whether low-carbon economy can be fully realized;     it remains a difficulty the country must overcome in the future.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">China continues to lack   sufficient creativity and innovative power while barriers to technological   transfer remain. The key to alternative energy and energy efficiency lies in   technological innovation and transfer. On the one hand, China currently lacks   advanced technology for dealing with carbon emission and faces difficulties in   importing such technology from other countries; it is forced to import advanced   technology in harnessing wind, solar and nuclear energy through commercial   channels. Despite the realization of some technological transfer through trade,   restrictions and barriers remain high. On the other hand, if China intends to   depend on autonomous research to lift itself out of the situation, the time and   effort that needs to be invested by China may generate a new dilemma, as   large-scale development and industrialization also require a significant amount   of time (ibid.).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bibliographic references</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Abbott, Chris, Paul   Rogers and John Sloboda. <i>Global     Responses to Global Threats: Sustainable Security for the 21st Century</i>.

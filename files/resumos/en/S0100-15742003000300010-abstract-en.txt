This paper addresses aspects referring to literature and culture industry products, mainly the "rosy" novels, focusing the potential role of different discourses on the formation of subjectivity. The characters portrayed in the novels O Quinze and As TrÃªs Marias by Rachel de Queiroz serve as reference. From this point of view, it is plain to see how fiction creations impregnate, sub-consciously and unconsciously, the deep layers of the personality. This may, in some cases, enlarge human knowledge and experience, sharpen means of expression, arose critical sense, but, in other cases, it may reinforce alienation from reality. It concludes that while literature offers the possibility to set people free, the products of culture industry, i.e. mass literature, are an invitation to alienation, to conformity, as they tend to instill stereotypes and prejudices.

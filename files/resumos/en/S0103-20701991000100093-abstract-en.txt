The trickster hero has been a constant subject of investigation for anthropologists and specialists in universal mythology. An ambiguous and contradictory figure, polemical by its very nature, the tricksters can be found both in mythological narratives of tribal societies and in the folk literary production of complex social formations. Thus the trickster encompasses a fairly large category of imaginary entities and the problems of interpretation arising thereof are of permanent concern to the anthropologist&#8217;s curiosity.

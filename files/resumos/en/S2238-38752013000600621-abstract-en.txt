Abstract The article addresses an object that in general remains almost imperceptible to society and the Criminal Justice System as a whole: prisoners' women. It focuses the products, specifically the food, brought to prisons by the prisoners' women in visiting days in the city of Rio de Janeiro. These are called "scraps" ("sucatas"). The analysis is mainly based on the perspective of anthropology and sociology of emotions. Accordingly, it is argued that among many possible feelings of domestic and familial relationships, the counterpart of the prisoners' partners becomes in the prison context love, fidelity and compassion. In that sense, as materialized feelings, the things that the women take to the interns, the so called "sucatas", can be seen as the concretion of affection, and pervade the relationship between man and woman established in prison.

Abstract This paper proposes to analyze the work of Ferreira de Castro, A Selva (The Jungle), published in 1930, under the perspective of sustainability. For that, the 3-D Sustainability Model was used, which presents a new approach to objectively evaluate hierarchies and the definition of priorities in the relationship between economic, social, and environmental sustainability. The methodology used in this research is classified as narrative and bibliographic review research. The limits of environmental capacity were observed, and it is necessary to re-evaluate human actions on the Amazonian environment. There is a need for greater emphasis on the preservation of fauna, flora, rivers and streams, as well as changes in management practices and preservation of the rubber tree. The complexity of the man-Amazon relationship is clear when the economic, social, and environmental dynamics is observed.

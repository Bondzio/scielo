Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Debate about sustainability always includes a    discussion of agriculture and environmental conservation, unavoidably making    agricultural production methods a major focus while bypassing the concern of    agricultural producers: can your sustainability sustain us and our way of life<a name="volta1"></a><a href="#nota1"><sup>1</sup></a>.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This work examines the comparative sustainability    of agricultural production systems, particularly agroforestry systems, and the    institutional arrangements through which those productive systems are conceived,    implemented, and developed. The object of this paper is to analyze (a) the systems    of sustainable agroforestry that exist in the study area and (b) the influence    of the technological patterns and institutional arrangements on the development,    operation, and sustainability of these systems.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The empiric area of study includes the Ca&iacute;    and Taquari river valleys in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande    de Sur, Brazil, the first area in Brazil colonized by Germans. These German    settlers farmed using traditional agricultural systems based on deforestation,    abundant land, and the long term multi-copping of subsistence foods. In the    1970s, this area underwent intense industrializing, which caused changes in    the social, economic, and environmental conditions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">According to Schneider (1994), the expansion    of the leather-shoe industry in the 1970s quickly urbanized this rural area,    creating a local market of products, services, and employment. With that, entirely    new flows of inputs, products, and work processes were generated and a new set    of cultural and community values were created (a process called "diffuse" industrialization    by some authors).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Over this period of industrialization, open space    was converted to perennial crops, such as fruit, lumber and lumber products,    and flowers and ornamental plants. This change in agricultural production was    brought about in a search for improved income though product diversification,    to meet the demand that negative environmental impacts be lessened (such as    a decrease in soil fertility, destruction of natural resources, environmental    degradation, and negative effects on the farmers' and his family’s health),    and as an adaptation to deteriorating conditions in the agricultural sector.    Among the region’s new agricultural productive systems, agroforestry stands    out. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Agroforestry uses less labor than most other    agricultural pursuits. This permits an increase in the local labor force’s availability    for industrial work and the continued maintenance of a profitable primary activity.    Agro-foresters are then able to maintain the characteristic social and cultural    traditions of family agriculture while using less of their and others’ time,    and time had become more valuable commodity. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The main agroforestry systems developed in this    region make use of several crop combinations: (a) exotic forest species (acacia,    eucalyptus) + subsistence crop cultivation (corn, bean, cassava, English potato);    (b) exotic forest species + watermelon; (c) exotic forest species + cattle;    (d) citrus fruits + forest species; (e) citrus fruits + subsistence crop cultivation;    and (f) Yerba mate + subsistence crop cultivation. Though political considerations    affect each of these agroforestry systems, they are implanted and developed    through three basic types of institutional arrangement. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><U>Individual arrangement</u>: in this type of    business arrangement, producers operate individually, without obligations to    any company, association, or cooperative. This option is generally associated    with the producer’s belief that he can obtain a larger number of economic, productive,    or social advantages through direct control of production, sales, and timing,    while maintaining freedom in the development of productive systems and flexibility    in relations with suppliers, buyers, and banks. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In this arrangement, the relationships that most    influence productive decisions are those within the family and with neighbors.    When the decisions are of more universal importance, the producer also turns    to friends, his group or club, his church, or occasionally, to municipal public    powers, technical advisers, and the social workers of EMATER-RS. There are also    cases of family farmers that have a rich net of commercial relationships or    have a relative who has the knowledge needed to give direction to the initial    productive arrangement. These cases are generally related to above average family    capitalization that permits the children's technical education and increased    spending for production technology and increased scale</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><U>Integrated arrangement</u>: in this business    arrangement, producer strategies are influenced by an outside agro-industrial    concern that supplies or subsidizes farm inputs and technical assistance and,    in compensation, receives some determined portion of the farm’s production.    Industries that have entered into this type of arrangement include Seta and    Tanac, tannin extraction concerns, Riocell, a producer of cellulose and paper,    Satipel, a eucalyptus lumber miller, and some citrus fruit processors.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The integrated arrangement begins with a network    of relationships that is basically agro- industrially oriented and, as such,    is directed by the needs of industrial producers to meet their markets’ demands.    Industrial orientation is reflected in the agroforestry productive systems by    the demands of quali-quantitative industrial requirements. In the cases of a    growing number of industrial companies, production is affected by the market’s    demand for superior quality and concern for environmental and social conditions    (mainly in the case of sellers into the international forest products markets,    which often necessitates some of form of lumber certification). These market    demands condition the production patterns followed by the basic input producers.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><U>Associative arrangement:</u> in this type    of business arrangement, individual producers are united in associations or    cooperatives. The reasons for uniting with this type of organization vary according    to the producer’s individual vision and the organization’s basic philosophy    and verified results. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The decision to join this type of business arrangement    rather than one of the other types arises from the producer’s broader needs;    needs which are not met by production and distribution improvements alone. Given    the great range of cooperative organizations, the actual relationship between    producer and organization is determined by their needs and strategies at the    specific moment of union. The extended needs thought to be met by associating    with a cooperative are linked with the producer’s desire for an improved quality    of life (a fundamental tenant of the associative philosophy), increased political    strength, and the sense of being part of a culturally similar group. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Commonly, cooperatives are greatly affected by    pubic powers, notably municipal city halls, official technical assistance organs    (EMATER-RS), wholesalers, such as CEASA, and CEAGE-SP, research institutions,    universities, non-government institutions, buyers, and vendors. The advantages    of affiliation with an associative organization are improved product commercialization,    more available technical attendance, lower cost acquisition of inputs and equipment,    and better access to credit and social assistance (health, education, and welfare).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

These systems also have the    higher Sustainability Indexes. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although the SI values for each system show little    differentiation, the sustainability patterns are shown to be extremely differentiated.    Each of the studied systems presents strength in different aspects of sustainability    as defined by this study. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In general, while a high value for the harmonic    average of the indicators of sustainability, expressed as the Sustainability    Index (SI), is a sign of more likely system sustainability, it is also assumed    that the more balanced the values of the different indicators, the more sustainable    the system. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">a.

Indicators 7 (quality of the soil) and    8 (impacts on other systems) show this system’s smallest values.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This agroforestry system has the most critical    &#91;lowest&#93; sustainability index among the studied systems.

It has five of the ten highest indicator values and none of the lowest values    (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> and <a href="#fig4">Illustration 4</a>). Even this    system’s weak indicators present medium to superior values when compared to    the values of the other systems’ indicators, and its more significant registrations,    those on which the system’s sustainability pattern is "anchored," are well distributed    among the four considered aspects. </font></p>     <p><a name="fig4"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n1/p05f04.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This system’s performance is largely due to the    values presented by the three indicators in the economic quadrant, the highest    of all the systems studied. Also presenting high values are indicators 1 (handling    of the production system), 8 (impacts on other systems) and 9 (taking decisions    in the property).

Considerations on the methodology and the    indicators</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To facilitate comparisons among systems, the    methodology we use generates a numeric index as a function of the chosen indicators    and local factors. An examination of the study’s results then tempts one to    affirm that one system is more or less sustainable than another. However, if    other indicators were chosen, the results may have been significantly different,    even to the extent of complete reversal. A system that appears sustainable if    examined using one combination of indicators, need not using another combination.    There is also the temptation to create a very large number of indicators, but,    due to data collection, segregation, comparison, and analysis difficulties,    it is unlikely that this would improve the study’s usefulness or aid in the    creation of public policies to reinforce general agrarian or specific production    systems<a name="volta2"></a><a href="#nota2"><sup>2</sup></a>. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To obtain an index that is a close reflection    of reality and to give a more complete evaluation of sustainability, it is appropriate    to use an index of indicators that are generated by composed related variables    since a larger number of variables can be introduced. On the other hand, the    creation of an index made up of these related indicators hinders more punctual    analyses of individual variables and/or attributes of sustainability and makes    the creation and monitoring of targets for specific variables difficult.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is also noted that the tendency to affirm    that one production system is better than another based only on the value of    any quantitative sustainability index may be a mistake. Local economic, environmental,    and organizational factors influence the formation of sustainability patterns.    These local factors, their conditions, and their combinations are site specific.    What may be sustainable in one locale may not be in another. The quantitative    value of a universally applied index that indicates system sustainability in    one region may lead to the erroneous assumptions about the same system’s success    in another region. A system with low sustainability index values that is adapted    to specific local and regional conditions may generate a more harmonic, balanced    sustainability pattern that perhaps more closely approaches the global conception    of sustainability than a system that shows high index values obtained using    artifice to transform qualitative attributes into quantities<a name="volta3"></a><a href="#nota3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The creation a sustainability index and the evaluation    of system sustainability are also conditioned <I>a priori </I>by the analyst’s    notion of sustainability, starting from the choice of variables and their composition    in the indicators. The realities to be studied and the comparisons that will    be made affect the analyst’s choice of variables. The analyst’s sensitivity    and knowledge will affect the creation of all indices making the indices themselves    more subjective than their results absolute numbers can indicate.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>5. About the agroforestry systems and the    institutional arrangements</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We saw that the systems’ sustainability patterns    are very differentiated. Each agroforestry system had its own strengths, weaknesses,    and pattern of sustainability. The <U>Acacia / Eucalyptus + watermelon</U>,    <U>Citrus + native forest species,</U> and <U>Acacia / Eucalyptus + </U>cattle    systems presented the best results, followed closely by the <U>Citrus + subsistence    cultivations</U> system. These systems not only present higher Sustainability    Indexes but also show more balanced patterns than the other studied systems.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The acacia systems noted in the paragraph above    have been in practice for almost a century. Under the specific local conditions,    the three traditional agroforestry systems show the largest number of favorable    conditions for long term maintenance of all studied systems: they have been    adapted to best succeed in their environment and show the highest Sustainability    Indexes. However, the newly developed <U>Citrus + native forest species</U>    system, in existence for less than ten years, also shows indicator values that    are balanced among the four aspects of sustainability and achieved our study’s    second highest SI value, demonstrating that its has excellent potential for    sustainability. This system is adapted to the socio-cultural environment in    which it was developed and is productively efficient, economically viable, and    environmentally suited. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On another hand, the old traditional systems    <U>Acacia / eucalyptus + subsistence cultivation</U> and <U>Yerba mate + subsistence    cultivation</U>, although they possess good balance among some aspects of sustainability    and have adapted to local and regional production conditions, are generally    weak. It is most probably due to their production objective, subsistence, that    these agroforestry systems show the study’s lowest Sustainability Indexes and    present the most unbalanced sustainability patterns.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most important objective of subsistence agriculture    is family reproduction, pure and simple, with a secondary search for some surplus    to exchange for manufactured products and, as much as possible, capitalization.    About 50% of the interviewees that farm using the two systems mentioned in the    preceding paragraph state that the objective of using an agroforestry system    is only to adapt production to the quali-quantitative realities of their labor    force. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The <U>Acacia / Eucalyptus + Watermelon</U> agroforestry    system surprisingly had the highest Sustainability Index in our study group,    largely due to the system’s strength in the economic quadrant. The registrations    for the system’s three economic indicators were the highest among the studied    systems, which was somewhat expected. The unexpected fact that the system also    showed great performance in indicators 1 (handling of the production system)    and 9 (taking decisions in the property) boosted the system’s global performance    to the top of the group. Indicators making up this system’s environmental aspect    presented very low performance, due to the use of chemical inputs on large scale.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The <U>Yerba mate + subsistence cultivation</U>    system presented the second lowest Sustainability Index value, caused by its    very low performances in the technician-productive and economic quadrants. Three    of the six indicators making up these two quadrants presented the study group’s    minimum registrations, while the remaining three indicators had only medium    values at best. This is partially related to the low prices received for the    system’s products, the large number of producers producing these products, and    the cartelization of agroindustry. As this system uses few inputs and needs    little cultural intervention, it would be expected that it would present environmental    performance much better than it actually did (third best in the study group)    and higher general performance. However, not only are this system’s environmental    and SI values low, its other indicators’ performances are only medium. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That the <U>Yerba mate + subsistence cultivation</U>    system’s environmental results are low when compared with the other studied    systems may give an incorrect impression. Many believe that this system should    have a high environmental rating as it its products are native perennials. Native    plants are in balance with the ecosystem and suffer from few diseases and infestations    that call for the intense use of herbicides and pesticides. Unfortunately, the    chosen indicators and the makeup of their respective descriptors only portray    a facet of the complex environmental dimension. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our frustration with results that show this system    to perform poorly in the environmental arena was tempered by the fact that in    the study area this system was usually associated with other cultivation systems,    cultivation systems with completely different characteristics, as a part of    the faming families’ attempt to guarantee survival. This heterogeneity of faming    systems improved the performance of some the <U>Yerba mate + subsistence cultivation    </U>system’s sustainability indicators while masking or decreasing the performance    of others.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the studied institutional arrangements, the    <U>Associative arrangement</U> stands out. It presents the most balanced pattern    made up of relatively high, if not the highest, indicator values. This arrangement    has its greatest strength in the organizational-environmental hemisphere, in    which it presents the best performance among all studied arrangements.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By associating with what is typically a cooperative,    producers are led to design their productive systems not only for economic maximization    and productive autonomy but to also meet the needs of their community of associates,    to improve the organization with which they are associated, and to better their    quality of life as part of a culturally similar group. The effect of the multiple    roles that association membership entails is made very clear by this institutional    arrangement’s strength in indicator 10, community and institutional participation.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Associations and cooperatives seem to stimulate    the general improvement of their members’ productive systems, perhaps due to    the technical development that the organization fosters. These types of organizations    also attend to their members’ cultural development by encouraging member interaction.    Members gather to discuss not only production and commercialization but also    the family, education, and health issues, which diversifies and balances their    interests and goals and stimulates their participation in local society’s growth.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The <U>Individual arrangement</U> presents the    second highest Sustainability Index. The arrangement shows four of the highest    indicator levels, two in the technician-productive quadrant and two in the economic    quadrant; although, economic indicator 5 (relationships with the markets) showed    the study’s lowest value for this indicator. The values for three of the four    indicators that comprised this arrangement’s environmental -organizational hemisphere    were also the lowest in our study.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The low value of indicator 5 (relationships with    the markets) highlights the dilemma faced by producers who have opted for this    productive arrangement: how does an individual consistently market a product    while occupied in the production of that product? These producers have more    product sale flexibility than those linked with outside institutions. This flexibility    allows them to sell for the best offer, which is reflected in their liquid income,    the largest among the studied arrangements. However, more than 80% of these    producers sell to "whomever appears," whether the final consumer, industry,    cooperative, or, most of the time, middlemen. These farmers can exploit market    opportunities that arrive at their doorstep, but they very vulnerable to unsettled    or shrinking markets.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The <U>Integrated arrangement</U> presents the    weakest and most unbalanced global performance, though not far distanced from    the Individual arrangement’s performance, with extremely low values for indicators    in the environmental, technician-productive, and economic quadrants. In the    case of the technician-productive aspect, the low productivity of both earth    and labor is a result of the low per hectare value of their harvest. The low    performance of the indicators making up this system’s economic aspect, though    a reflection of product value, could also be associated to these producers’    lack of economic or productive flexibility should abrupt political, economic,    or market disturbances negatively affect their industrial partner.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our study results indicate that attendance to    agro industrial quality and quantity standards reduces the earth’s and the farmer’s    productivity, keeps the farmer’s liquid income low, and, through the demand    for intensive "optimized" use of natural resources, negatively impacts the environment.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>6. Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It can be affirmed that the chosen methodology    was effective for the proposed work. It permitted clear differentiation of the    studied agroforestry systems by technological and organizational format and    the determination of these systems’ sustainability patterns. The methodology    also identified the studied agroforestry systems’ strong and weak points, clarified    the relationship between Sustainability Indexes, institutional arrangement,    and technological format, and allowed comparison of different systems and institutional    arrangements. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, the concept of economic &quot;sustainability&quot;    is new and constantly being redefined. The results from practical studies of    system sustainability cannot be generalized with accuracy, as systems under    study have adapted to site specific characteristics. Further complicating the    creation of a comprehensive index of sustainability, the researcher’s subjective    understanding of both &quot;sustainability&quot; and the world determine the    choice, constitution, and composition of sustainability indicators. A different    researcher’s simple alteration of the selected indicator’s composition, let    alone the substitution of indicators, can make one study’s sustainable system    unsustainable or turn two or more systems into incomparable realities. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The analysis of agro ecosystem sustainability    is made more difficult by changing parameters, especially the social indicators,    not only between locations but also over time. What is inappropriate and unacceptable    in one place or time, may be appropriate and acceptable in another place or    at another time. Agricultural system elements also develop over time, altering    the relationships among system components and between these components and the    environment. What is clear is that the identification of sustainability parameters    and determination of the indicators’ composition is complicated. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Improvement in the method of choosing and combining    indicators and the variables that make up these indicators could be the object    of specific interdisciplinary studies over several years. It is highly probable,    though, that the determination of a generic group of indicators and descriptors    that define &quot;sustainability&quot; over a wide group of productive systems    will prove impossible. A more useful pursuit may be the development of methodologies    that signal changes that have occurred in important aspects of the specific    reality under study.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In light of the preceding discussion of the relative    value of sustainability indicators, we see limited possibility that we can point    to one of our indicators and affirm that it is more or less appropriate than    any other. In the current work, the choice of indicators and their composition    through descriptors doesn't constitute more than an entrance to the subject    of sustainability, leaving countless obscure points for further determination.    At the least, this study employed approaches and decision rules so that its    results clearly meet its defined &quot;sustainability&quot; parameters. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our Sustainability Index is both an expression    of the maintainable operation of an agro ecosystem, property, or organization    and an indicator that can lead to the recognition of areas that need improvement.    From this perspective, the Sustainability Index and its components could assist    the development of public policies by focusing attention on the weak areas of    particular agroforestry systems. The <U>citrus + native forest species</U> agroforestry    system for example<U>,</U> given its adaptability to local conditions, balance,    productive efficiency, and economic viability, could be justifiably supported    by and included in proposed public politics that seek to improve economic performance    and support amplification by the aggregation of new producers. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In relation to the studied institutional arrangements,    the Associative arrangement, confirming our expectations, was found to be the    most balanced. It showed the highest levels of organization, cultural acceptability,    and environmental concern. It is the most appropriate arrangement for assistance    by public policies that seek to increase the levels of local and regional sustainability.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We should remind the reader that our concept    of institutional arrangement stressed the importance of associativism in the    form of partnerships, cooperatives, and general social participation. Our view    is that partnerships, supporters, and relationships with government and non-governmental    institutions—the "institutions&quot; in &quot;institutional arrangements"&#151;are,    in the last analysis, what galvanize and reinforce a company in its effort to    reach proposed productive, organizational, economic, and environmental goals.    Thus, the institutional space forged makes possible the development and diffusion    of characteristics, organizational presuppositions, technologies, and methods    intended to increase productive system sustainability and socio-cultural satisfaction.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When positive local development takes place,    it is almost always in a favorable political and social environment brought    about by the convergence of local society’s actors around certain development    priorities and orientations: when local actors believe in development. In the    same way, changes in agricultural practices and cultivation techniques are bought    about by changes in the agricultural sector’s general social context: the adoption    of sustainable farming techniques will occur when the farmers believe that sustainable    farming brings rewards.</font></p>     ]]></body>

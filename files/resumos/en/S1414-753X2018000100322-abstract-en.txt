Abstract In areas of Caatinga, hunting is considered a threat to fauna and ecological balance, and the study of hunting activity is relatively important for the elaboration of conservation strategies. This research aims to identify hunted wildlife species, their use, and hunting techniques in two towns of Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil. We interviewed 80 resident students from rural areas. Eighty-four species were recorded, which fall into the following categories of use: food (73), pets (43), medicinal (14) and trade (45). The animals are captured through 15 techniques, the shotgun being the most impactful technique for local fauna. The species with the highest Use Value were the six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) and the ruddy ground dove (Columbina talpacoti). The use of faunal resources and the achievement of hunting activities in the studied areas are closely related to cultural and socioeconomic factors.

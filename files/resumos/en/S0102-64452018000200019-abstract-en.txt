Abstract The article analyses the ABC Paulista metal workers&#8217; strike movements, in 1978, 1979 and 1980, which are considered to be the beginning of a long contention cycle that lasted until the 1990s. Although taking into account the confrontation dynamics among workers, capital and state, we focus on the labor movement actions and responses, by dealing with the influence of internal and external factors upon the workers&#8217; movement. In the last part we put past and present in dialogue and present the issues challenging the labor collective action.

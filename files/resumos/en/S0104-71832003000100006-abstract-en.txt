This paper explores the conquest and colonization effects of the Argentinian Chaco as for the space, the language and the body of the regions natives. Great changes took place in the way of life of the native groups (specially the mocovíes, tobas and pilagás, of the guaykurú linguistic branch, and the wichí, of the mataco-maká branch) with this process - a process that became very rapid and dynamic with the military expeditions sent by the government of Buenos Aires in the years of 1884 through 1911. I focus on the consequences of the official policy carried out at the time, a policy of "pacifying" and "civilization" of the natives by means of a "reduction" system - reduction of the state and religion, and all other means of action associated to these. I also analyze the impact that such policies had on the construction of the legality, of the oral and written language, and also the fate of all the bodies disciplined by means of the "work" routines and the use of space characteristic of the western capitalist idea of work, that was to be implemented in this region.

The article questions why, in Mexico (independent of the fact that this problem also occurs in other Latin American latitudes), the so-called "educational research" (ER) has uncritically adopted the educational theory and/or the classical pedagogical theory. This work maintains that the proposed perspective of an "experimental" basis cannot presume to possess the knowledge tools for educational research, or state that this paradigm is the right one. For this reason, the text presents a brief exercise of problematization of some of the multiple dimensions that include, or could include, something like the field of education. Subsequently, the paper outlines a proposal that deals with the construction of knowledge in this field at its key points of articulation, which include the questioning and control of the explanatory element of the general educational and social theories, to emphasize the need for a critical use of these theories, and a critical use of the ideological factors, the "experiential," as predetermining factors, often a priori.

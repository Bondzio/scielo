This essay seeks to contribute to the analysis of the field of socio-anthropological studies on sexual and gender diversity in Brazil. It maps issues and approaches that were highlighted in the latest conformation of this field, marked by the critics of "homosexuality' as an encompassing classificatory category and social identity. We are interested in pointing out some conceptual and methodological issues that have been raised as challenges in the context of an extraordinary increase of research on sexuality and gender, as well as increasing politicization of these topics.

The aim of this paper is to analyze the processes of reproduction of social inequalities in migratory contexts taking into account the gender, ethnic and social class dimensions, focusing on the study of the current migration of Bolivian women to Argentina. This article will discuss how those dimensions affect the social and economic incorporation of female migrants in the host society. The categories of gender, ethnicity and social class can not be considered separately but all together, because they reinforce reciprocally, intensifying the practices and discourses of exclusion that Bolivian women have historically faced in this country.

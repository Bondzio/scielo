Abstract: The article points out the lack of attention given by the Brazilian sociology to the involvement of women in crime and violent action, exploring possible reasons for that. A great part of studies analyse the participation of women in criminality and violent action come to the conclusion that this involvement occurs under the subordination to a male partner or assuming secondary roles determined by men. Based on findings of on-going researches, it comes to other results than those available in the sociological literature. Based on the biographical narrative approach, it comes to a variety of roles played by women in crime and violent actions.

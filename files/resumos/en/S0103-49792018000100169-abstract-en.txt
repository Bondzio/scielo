Taking the reality of the Universidade da Integração Internacional da Lusofonia Afro-brasileira (UNILAB) as a starting point, theoretical-methodological approaches of the social sciences and their revision in the context of &#8220;lusophony&#8221; are discussed. Several qualitative methodologies are addressed and detailed, considering the context of social subjects linked to the CPLP countries and the colonial world. In the search for a sociology of speech and a geography of discourses, we emphasize the importance of daily life as a basis for work and epistemological reflection. To think of it continually from the relational differences that the lusophone context causes, is part of the result of the researcher's considerations in this field.

Abstract The environmental impacts of hydroelectric dams in Brazil are investigated in local and regional scales, for the last years. In this paper, we analyze the impact than the establishment of a hydroelectric dam has for the people and their spaces, with the comparative experiences occurred for the North and South of Brazil. We will focus on aspects related to the organization of families, social fight, the compensation and resettlement of people affected by the dam's construction, as well we take a look to the similarities between the two areas, with emphasis on aspects related to migration, mobility and landscapes. For this, we rely on research carried out on the river Uruguay (South), based on interviews, questionnaires and studies of primary and secondary sources, from 2007 to 2014 and also in a survey that is currently being held in Belo Monte area (North), which also uses primary and secondary sources, with fieldwork periods.

This article aims to analyze the material conditions of the educational service in basic education public schools in Brazil, particularly in the North and Northeast, as well as to highlight the challenges that are faced by the municipal educational administration, the primary locus of early childhood education and elementary education. To that end, we analyze the changes in school organization that have been implemented in Brazil since the second half of the 1990s, in a context marked by educational reforms at the federal, state, municipal and school levels, and the teaching conditions in basic education, which are highlighted here as an emblematic expression of the situation of Brazilian public schools.

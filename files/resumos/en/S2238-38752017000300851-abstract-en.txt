Abstract This paper explores the creation, consolidation and destabilization of the Frente Amplio de Uruguay en Argentina and the management of its main political remittances since the 1980s: the transnational vote from Argentina to Uruguay. Following the recent proposal of Boccagni, Lafleur andLevitt (2015), it describes the actors (migrants and nonmigrants) that make up the transnational political network, the transformations on their material infrastructure and circulation channels while observing the specificities that fit the processes of political incorporation associated with the histories and migratory trajectories shared by Uruguay and Argentina. The empirical data is a product of the multi-situated ethnographic fieldwork and includes the analysis of sources produced by the interviewees and/or their political groups, the press of both countries and the revision of secondary literature.

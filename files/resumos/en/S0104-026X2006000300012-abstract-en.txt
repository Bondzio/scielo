This paper is based on the debate proposed by Mary Hawkesworth in "The semiotics of a Premature Burial: Feminism in a Post-Feminist Age". It is guided by a Latin-American and Caribbean view of the transformations of feminism and of women's achievements in critical moments of that articulation, recollecting outstanding periods such as the renovation of feminist ideals; the autonomy of the black women's movement and its inter-relation with black and feminist activism; and international articulations tuned with Brazilian reality/diversity and with the incorporation of the feminist agenda within governmental instances. The author portrays how the verve and retro-feeding capacity of Brazilian feminism provide the necessary strength for its survival, as well as for its innovations which are consonant with the evolution of social values, leading to its various achievements as they stem from local, regional and global arenas. Substantially, the author has developed this text with a sharp focus on local activism as the trigger for effective governmental action towards achieving gender and race equity.

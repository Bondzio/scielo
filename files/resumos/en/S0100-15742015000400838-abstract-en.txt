First, this article discusses the argument that academic productivity would be the primary cause of the academic problems that affect research production. The expression, academic productivity, relates directly to research evaluation policies that value only the quantification of products, being careful not to use it in a generic and imprecise way. Following that, it deals with publications in journals. In the history of the press and the history of science, economic interests prevail as well as the hegemony of the commercial scholarly publishers which interferes with the definition of publication and evaluation policies, the increase in production costs and the autonomy of journals. Finally, it focuses on research quality, identifying historical issues, interests groups and problems in evaluation processes within graduate programs.

This text presents the results of a case study focusing on a secondary technical school managed by an a Civil Society Organization of Public Interest - Oscip -, through the analysis of a management contract that was signed with the Cear√° State government. Data indicate that this particular "public-private" partnership departs from the criticized "quasi-market" model implemented in the educational area in England, since the market mechanisms introduced here turned out to be quite different. In the case studied, the weakening of the schools' public dimension passes through another discussion, in which the demand to sell services to supplement the school's budget seems to have harmful developments in the school dynamics, of which the high rate of drop-outs can be a relevant indicator.

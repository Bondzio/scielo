Abstract Indigenous people have an intrinsic relationship with the flora used in healing systems. However, data about plants used to treat intestinal parasitosis, which are one of the main morbidity and mortality causes among indigenous peoples, remain scarce. Thus, the aim of the current study is to survey antiparasitic plants used by the Kantarur√©-Batida community and to investigate whether their ethno-medico-botanical knowledge is spread. Therefore, it adopted interviews and free lists. Thirty-one (31) indigenous individuals were interviewed and they mentioned 21 plant species. Most respondents (91%) acquired the traditional knowledge through hereditary transmission and spread it (77%) in the same way. Only 35% of the respondents adopt medicinal plants as the first cure resource, besides associating the decrease of such use to their proximity to health care services. Thus, it is worth taking actions to help preserving the local knowledge and biodiversity in order to avoid the loss of indigenous therapeutic treatments.

This work aims to analyze the competitiveness of pejibaye palm heart production in Espírito Santo and São Paulo states by applying the Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM). Results show that the private and social profitabilities of pejibaye palm heart production and trading were positive in both states and are higher than those obtained by traditional crops, such as soybean, and by forest products, such as natural rubber. São Paulo production was more profitable, being thus more competitive than Espirito Santo. However, these profitabilities could have been higher if producers were not exposed to negative effects of distorted public policies.

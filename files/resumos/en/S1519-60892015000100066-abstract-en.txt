Abstract: In this paper, I present some arguments built upon the ethnography I developed about Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s Lapa. Throughout this work, I briefly recover the different historical momenta experienced in Lapa to problematize its constant sociocultural and spatial transformation process. Based on those historical elements, I attempt to set connections considering: a) contributions from distinct authors that tried to reflect about city, order, disorder, crime, violence and conflict management within public space and b) policing policies adopted recently in the region, with the intention of comprehending the logics that orient police practices.

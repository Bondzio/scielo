ABSTRACT This article aims to investigate some of Alfredo Volpi&#8217;s artworks from the 1950s that dialogue in a paradoxical way with Brazilian paintings at that time. This set of Volpi&#8217;s concrete artwork ciphers, in their compositions, tensions that occurred at different levels of that precarious modernization process, and seems to present, with cunning, the limits of a certain mythical rationality that traversed the late Brazilian constructive modern art.

Abstract This article concerns a wider research regarding the act of unmaterial beings in a candomblé temple, in which I am an initiated. This text approaches a crisis witnessed by me during the funeral ritual named axexê, when I was &#8220;affected&#8221; by an intense force providing from the time of the deceased, and that, due to the contribution of the &#8220;ontological turn&#8221; in Anthropology, it allows me to see the temple under the influence of distinct realities - the living and the dead -, and not through the plurality of the visions of the world. Though, I suggest a re-reading of the anthropological blues concepts, to cover either the ethnographers&#8217; affections in which analysis overcame the relativist premises and considering it as a possibility to create theoretical propositions concerning the effective continuity with the native premises.

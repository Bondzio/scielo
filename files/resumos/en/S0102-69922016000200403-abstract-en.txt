Abstract The financial realm is normally see as the perfect reasonable world. There we just have practical concerns. This article aims to show how that kind of "automatic" assumption is problematic, because finance too is based on a set of cultural foundations. Changing this foundations, we can see and explore a new set of actions and thoughts about economics and the economy. From that perspective we can talk about a new "type of domination" for the situation seen in Brazil's Lula's time. The materials for my hypothesis came just from the transformations in Brazilian financial realm in that times and my attempt to prove the assumption show some nuances of the classificatory systems that sustain this new order. Particularly, the "high clergy/low clergy and homework" way of talk about Brazilian cultural and social hierarchies.

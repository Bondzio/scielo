The text analyzes the data obtained from a study into the use of Quality Indicators in Education - Indique -, a participative self-evaluation tool for schools. The study aimed to look for information on how to use the material, its limits and its results, and consisted in interviews and focus groups with technicians from Departments of Education, principals, teachers, employees, students and family members.

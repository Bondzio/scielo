ABSTRACT This article aims to discuss a set of theoretical and methodological references about teaching performance, in order to identify characteristics of a &#8220;good teacher&#8221;. It is based on a review of literature on teacher-effect, school effectiveness, teacher performance, teaching skills, teacher knowledge and the professionalization process. The categories of analyses used are the five dimensions of teaching in high school: knowledge, strategy, relational, motivational and professional. It can be concluded that the expansion of the concepts of what makes a &#8220;good high school teacher&#8221; can contribute to the implementation of policies that will promote the development of the teaching career and to guidelines for the initial and continuous training courses of specialized teachers.

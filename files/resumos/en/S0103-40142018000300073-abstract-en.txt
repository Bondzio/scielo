ABSTRACT The area of Physics teaching in Brazil has a long tradition. Research and graduate programs in Physics teaching, as well as national conferences, have existed for decades. Many instructional materials and projects in Physics teaching have already been developed. Journals and publications in this area confirm that it exists and is consolidated. Paradoxically, however, nowadays Physics teaching in Brazil is in a serious crisis, outdated, minimized, underestimated. This text analyzes, critically, several aspects of Physics teaching that led to this crisis and presents some challenges that must be faced to change the situation and redeem Physics teaching in Brazil. The views presented here are always the author&#8217;s personal outlook and derive from his extensive experience in this area.

ABSTRACT This article describes the most recent Chemistry undergraduate curriculum of USP&#8217;s Institute of Chemistry. We point out how the institutional option for professional training to meet the demands of scientific research, the productive sector and basic education, allied to the characteristics of a research institute and previous curricular experiences, led to some principles that served to structure and organize the curriculum. Among these principles, the following stand out: academic freedom for students to choose their profession and define their formative route; a solid base of chemical knowledge and encouragement for constant studies. Finally, it points out that a curricular change should not be limited to changes in the courses offered. The next step involves a real culture change that focuses on a more active learning process.

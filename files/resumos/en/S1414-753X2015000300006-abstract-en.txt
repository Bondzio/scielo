AbstractThe article presents a conceptual study of Locavorism and discusses its economic and environmental dimensions; debates about the quality of and risks associated with local foods; and the relationship among Locavorism, vegetarianism and feminism. Categories typically presented as homogeneous, including 'one's own place', 'others' place', 'local food', 'locality food' and 'traditional food', will be analysed. Locavorism can be used as a strategy to promote family farming and food practices that are in dialogue with the principles of sustainability. This research indicates the need to develop empirical studies that can investigate new ways to relate to one's locality.

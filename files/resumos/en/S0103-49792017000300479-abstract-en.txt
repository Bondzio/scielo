This article's objective is to present Andr√© Gorz's critical analysis of work and political ecology starting from the centrality that the concept of economic rationality acquires in his thought. To the author, the unlimited extension of economic rationality to work and nature is considered futureless from the viewpoint of society. Gorz recognizes the intimate relationship between criticism of capitalism and the task of political ecology. Another aspect present in his work - the least explored one - is the relationship between work and ecological crisis. Capitalism appropriates work or employment not just for its interests, but also for transforming them into instruments of environmental destruction. This paper also aims to indicate - following the spirit of Gorz, although in a succinct manner - a few alternative horizons.

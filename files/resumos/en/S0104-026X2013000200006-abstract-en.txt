In this paper I present some conclusions about "state feminism" in Portugal, a theme understudied in the country and the central object of my PhD research in sociology from the State Law and Administration (FEUC / CES). In the study I questioned the action of the Portuguese state in the promotion of gender equality since 1970, specifically the role of the currently named as Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality - CIG, as a formal mechanism for equality, in articulation with women's movements, in promoting public policies for equality. I explain the main challenges facing the Commission and women's associations, namely, gender mainstreaming, the politicization of the area, the new public management, the adoption of the language of "gender", the change in the relationship with NGOs and the inclusion of new agents and new axes of inequality.

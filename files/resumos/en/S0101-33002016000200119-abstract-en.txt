ABSTRACT This article seeks to analyse the unprecedented alignment between state, finance and construction industry that took place in Brazil in the 2000s, enabling the housing production for middle and low&#8209;income families promoted by large construction companies and developers. If, on the one hand, there was the establishment of a real estate and financial complex quite sophisticated, on the other, it remained the industrial production base with archaic elements and the dependence on public subsidies.

In this article, Van Parijs advocates unconditional basic income. According to his stance, this form of income transfer, which corresponds to a subsidy paid to all citizens regardless of their position, occupation, marital status and willingness and availability to work, is necessary to build a fair society. The author seeks to show that unconditional basic income is relevant to a liberal conception of egalitarian and non-discriminatory justice, that is, it does not confer distinct value to individuals' life conceptions.

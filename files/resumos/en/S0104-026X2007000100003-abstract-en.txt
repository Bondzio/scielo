This paper is an analysis of how the Pastoral da Criança (Children's Pastoral), organization of the Catholic Church, seeks to define women's identities by disseminating practices related to the use and care of the body. The techniques utilized to examine and care for the body found in the handbooks of the Pastoral da Criança are used to develop women's self-identification as mothers among the women seen by the service and the "líderes" (leaders) as educators. This work enables the Pastoral da Criança to present an ideology opposed to feminist activities and compete with the later in government spheres in which policies related to the use of the body are defined.

Abstract: Latin America historiography faces two unavoidable challenges: The deconstruction of a Eurocentric history based on principles and values considered to be universal that distorted vision and study of cultures that developed over several thousands of years before the Spanish Conquest and Portuguese, in the case of Brazil; and the deconstruction of patriarchal story that does not make visible women in the different processes in our history. Reverse and transform this situation is the objective of our work focused on the visibility of women in their spaces, cultural practices, and participation in the history of the continent. Only then we will have a comprehensive history that collect both experiences.

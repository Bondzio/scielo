In addition to damaging flora and fauna, air pollution can affect people's health. This paper is a systematic review of epidemiological studies carried out in the state SÃ£o Paulo assessing the effects of air pollution on health, all of them suggesting an association between atmospheric pollution and health problems in the population. Several diseases were studied, demonstrating that air pollution not only affects the respiratory system, but can also be a risk factor for other problems, such as low weight at birth, incidence of and mortality from cancer, premature births and sickle cell anemia.

Abstract This paper examines disputes involving lay and religious leaders in the Brazilian public sphere between the years 2010 and 2013. Pastor Silas Malafaia protagonizes the clashes here recapitulated, first against Congresswoman Iara Bernardi, on the occasion of a debate on the PLC 122/2006, going through his echoed interview in Marilia Gabriela talk show and culminating in the clash against Congressman Jean Wyllys concerning the PDC which became known as the &#8220;gay cure&#8221;. Drawing on a dialogue between contemporary social theory and political philosophy, we evaluated the dilemmas presented from the ultimate viewpoints in dispute, illuminating the ways that define their views of what life in a secular and democratic society is.

Studies on second homes gained momentum in the 1990s with the increase in property acquisitions outside of cities. This work contributes to the study of the relationships among second homes, locals and a state park in southeastern Brazil. Objectives were to describe the second homes on the northern coast of SÃ£o Paulo associated with improved access and to highlight conflicts and proposed solutions. The method was based on mapping the roads to assess the second homes, interviews with stakeholders about their conflicts and demands. The arena of discussion was monitored for conflict resolution. The results suggest the need of tools to aid in the dialogue among the owners of second homes, the leaders of local communities and environmental agents. Such tools would support progress in conflict resolution and improved management in the area with the zoning, regulations directed at second homes, social spaces for communities and the conservation of ecosystems.

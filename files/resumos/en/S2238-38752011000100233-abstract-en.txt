Abstract: The allegories are expressive elements of the narrative and ritual performances of Bois Bumb√°s Parintins/Amazon festival and of the samba schools parade in Rio. They are ritual art par excellence, since they are made &#8203;&#8203;to be fully consumed in their use. The function of the allegories in these two spectacular festivals is highly performative, for its ritual consumptions brings about decisive effects on the dynamics of the presentations. The paper examines the roles, meanings and uses of allegory in the context of Bumba Parintins elaborating the notions of wonder and risk for its understanding.

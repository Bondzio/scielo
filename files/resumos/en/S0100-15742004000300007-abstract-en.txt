The purpose of this article is to identify how Vygotsky's concepts were appropriated by authors related to Education Psychology in Brazil, as well as their aims and the moment in which such ideas were here employed. The basis for this research was the whole of articles published in Cadernos de Pesquisa, journal of Fundação Carlos Chagas, which mentioned, in their bibliographical references, any work of Vygotsky. Since 1971 up to 2000, 37 articles were found. The production was organized by decade and analysed through categories built a posteriori. The results have shown that works based on Vygotsky concepts not only did not advance sufficiently from the theoretical point of view, but were also restricted to development and learning processes and to the relationship between thought and language.

The organization and structure of Brazilian central government have drastically changed from monarchic period (1824-1889) to the recent democratic time. However, it is possible to identify a convergence between some Brazilian authors who have, not only reflected about state reform in Brazil, but have acted on it: visconde do Uruguai (minister and Senator during the first empire period in Brazil, responsible for an important state reform at his time - 1830 to 1852); Oliveira Vianna (bureaucrat on Getulio Vargas's term and responsible for important changes in state structure and its relation with trade unions in Brazil during the 1930's); Guerreiro Ramos (sociologist and bureaucrat at Public Service Administration Department responsible for the Brazilian bureaucratic state reform from 1940 to 1964); and Bresser-Pereira (minister of Ministry of Federal Administration and State Reform during Fernando Henrique Cardoso's first term - 1995 to 1998 - who was responsible for the current managerialization of the Brazilian state). What is interesting to note about these political author-actors actors is that, during their respective periods and with their unique perceptions about Brazilian policy and society, they believed that by reforming the administrative structure of the state they could change political culture of the Brazilian people. During their political actions as Brazilian bureaucrats they each searched for the self-government, the democracy or its qualification within their own historical and political contexts.

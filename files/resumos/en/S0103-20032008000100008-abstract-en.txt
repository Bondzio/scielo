The aim of the present paper is to analyze the relationship between exchange rates changes and prices of main Brazilian exports, the exchange rate pass-through. A varying-parameter model was used to estimate the coefficients of pass-through. The results suggest that incomplete pass-through of exchange rate changes is a pervasive phenomenon. These results are in line with other estimates presented in the literature.

AbstractThis paper begins reviewing the Urban Sociology literature on how the public space is produced. It continues with an analysis of a specific urban conflict, the 'red zone' of the neighborhood of Palermo, part of the City of Buenos Aires. The article reflects on the discourses and the practices of the groups involved in the 'red zone' and the changes in the legal regulations that produce public spaces. These spaces were not for everyone, just for a few. This article aims to start a new debate within the Urban Sociology literature on how sexualities also produce public spaces. It has not been sufficiently explored within this discipline.

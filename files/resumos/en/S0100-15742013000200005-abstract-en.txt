The paper analyzes the evolution of informal labor in Brazil, from 2001 to 2009, based on the Pesquisas Nacionais por Amostra de Domic√≠lio &#91;Nacional Household Research Sample&#93;. Questions such as "where" the informal workers are, "who they are" and "how much they make" guided the study, which, in addition to comparisons between the formal and informal sector, also had gender as a focus. Heterogeneity, a trait of the informal sector, is visible in the various economic sectors, in the various positions within occupations and in the unequal opportunities for women and blacks compared to males and whites. Although informal labor in Brazil has declined over the decade, the small growth recorded is due to the entry of women, particularly black women, into the labour market.

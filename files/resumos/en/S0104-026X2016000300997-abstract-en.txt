Abstract: The celebration of the 40 years of Angola's independence serve as a starting point to do an analysis of the status of women in that country over that period. Because as it is a long period, marked by numerous events that, in one way or another, shaped the country, we divide our analysis into three distinct stages: the post-independence period, characterized by the struggle of women for their statement; the post-war period, marked by economic growth;, and a third period, that especially characterizes the present time that Angolan women are facing.

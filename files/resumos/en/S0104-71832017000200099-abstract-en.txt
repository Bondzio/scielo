Abstract: Based on the etnographic experience in the zoo of Bosque Rodrigues Alves, in the city of Belém (PA), we focus on the relationships between humans and non-humans, specifically the daily interactions between carers, biologists, veterinarians and the primate specie known as squirrel monkey (mico-de-cheiro) (Saimiri sciureus sciureus), as well as the interactions with the visitors and passersby that walk in and around the green area, involving the care for the animals&#8217; well-being, in this case the fauna team, and even the relationships of commensalism, allowing multisensorial experiences between humans and monkeys, pointing to the displacement of perspectives and attitudes towards the non-humans in the urban Amazônia.

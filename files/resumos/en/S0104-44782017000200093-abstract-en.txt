Abstract The article discusses the political action of industrialist businessmen to influence state policies in the economic crisis of 1998-2001, focusing on its corporate organization (the Union Industrial Argentina) and the alliances that it builds. Our hypothesis is that on the beginning of the crisis in late 1998, it was producing a division of businessmen unity witch was characterizing the &#8216;90s, for the inability to overcome the crisis by lowering wages. To reduce the impact of the crisis, industrial businessmen claim for government policies to increase the competitiveness of production of goods and change the relative prices of the economy (being opposed to the demands of businessmen in the financial sector, centered at controlling the fiscal deficit, in particular by low public spending). To test this hypothesis, we analyze the progress of the crisis, the government policies to manage it, the demands of businessmen, and the try to unify their demands with other business associations or unions. We take official statistics, business documents (especially by the Uni√≥n Industrial Argentina) and press articles as empirical material. We show the businessmen conflict had to do with the unequal impact of the crisis, with greater intensity in industry, construction and agriculture, and lower in finance and services. We find that the ideas of industrialists to overcome the crisis were centered on the loss of competitiveness of production, too different to the orthodox ideas of the government about the crisis. To promote their interests, the industrialist businessmen organization made alliances with agriculture and construction businessmen organization; and with the deepening of the crisis, they try to make it also with unions and organizations of the financial sector. As a result, we corroborate our hypothesis about the businessmen conflict and we produce enough empirical evidence to discuss the well-known thesis of Argentine social science argues that industrial businessmen were struggling for the peso devaluation (while the financial sector businessmen were pushing for the dollarization of the economy).

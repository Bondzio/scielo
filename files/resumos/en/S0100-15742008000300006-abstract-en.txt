Departing from the process of elaboration of pedagogical projects in three institutions of vocational education and its consequences to the reconstruction of the pedagogical and professional identities in a setting marked by changes in the Brazilian curriculum policies implemented in the 90's, this article analyses the macro-relations by setting up out from micro-relations: the speeches of representatives of pedagogical teams, teachers and the head-teachers of the institutions studied. Despite the isolated efforts of individual teachers, it was found that there is no clarity in relationship to these educational institutions' role, which are regulated by mechanisms for assessing the competences acquired, by the redefinition of administrative and financial procedures, as well as by widening their duties and responsibilities. These, at the end, would lead to a model that meets the imperative needs of the market and, consequently, to an exogenous formulation of the pedagogical and institutional identities.

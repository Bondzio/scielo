Abstract Minervino de Oliveira - an Afro-Brazilian who was born in Rio de Janeiro three years after the slavery abolition - was the candidate chosen by the Brazilian Communist Party to run for presidency in 1929. Although he did not get an expressive number of votes in the poll, his campaign did not lose its historical importance, since he was the first Afro-Brazilian, factory worker and communist candidate to run for the most important position in the nation. The aim of this article is to present some excerpts about this character and to rebuild aspects of his political career and election campaign from late 1929 to the first three months of 1930.

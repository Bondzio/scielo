Abstract The article discusses the relationship between creativity and market in the context of so-called creative economy. The argument is, in short, that the activities of creation of the agents depend on a complex combination of different interests and social interactions, expressing themselves always in a contextual way. The creative arts and science professionals tend to be interested not only by the search for material well-being, but also for personal recognition and the ethical sense of what they do, building paths and arrangements of diverse interactions that allow them to access relevant resources. The discussion is conducted based on the experience of professionals in the arts and sciences related to sectors of the new knowledge-based and creative economy, working in universities and small businesses in the city of Porto Alegre.

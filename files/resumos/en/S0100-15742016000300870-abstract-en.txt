Abstract This paper examines the semantic force contained in notions of the future in politics and education, based on Hannah Arendt's essay "Crisis in Education" (1958). For her, the tradition left a legacy regarding the conception of politics as a creation (poiésis), taking away the very dignity of human action (práxis) in this context of vita activa [active life]. The political phenomenon of birth, the eruption of newarrivals in the world and the promise of a new beginning, serve as counterpoints to the desire to create, be it a new society or be it a new man, in the educational context. The over-use of the slogan of a school of the future justifies a more detailed examination of the conservative attitude that Arendt bestows upon education in its exercise of political thought as a form of preserving the new political potential of new-arrivals in the world.

Abstract Although the concept &#8220;ethnopolitics&#8221; has been applied to ethno-political minority groups or with a different socio-historical origin from the hegemonic nationalism, in this article I try to set the general parameters the Mexico Americans&#8217; ethnopolicy in southeast Houston for a recent time: 2010-2011. The corollary of this policy some of ethno-national minorities influence the ways of &#8220;welcoming&#8221;, teaching and disciplining the new immigrants to this texan town. Ethnography, an optimal scientific instrument focused on small urban communities and multiculturalism, shows a very different reality regarding appearance and speech broadcasted by those ethno-political organizations. In my findings, I stablish the structural links between the Mexican American ethnopolicies and U.S. nationalist ideology and its &#8220;multicultural&#8221; nation&#8217;s draft.

Abstract This article analyzes the paths of engineering and teaching degree students at the Federal Technological University of Paran√° - UTFPR - and at the Federal University of Bahia - UFBA - considering possible factors related to gender that impact these paths. The study was conducted in two stages, the first was quantitative and the second, in which this article was based, qualitative. Mechanical and civil engineering students as well as language and mathematics teaching students from the two universities were interviewed. The study showed that there are differences in the paths and challenges faced by men and women who dare to enter into academic environments socially perceived as the stronghold of the opposite sex. Women in engineering degrees and men in teaching degrees are the most exposed to prejudice and discrimination.

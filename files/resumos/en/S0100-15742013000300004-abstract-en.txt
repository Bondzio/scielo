This paper deals with the Plano de Metas Compromisso Todos pela Educação and its main instrument, the Plano de Ações Articuladas, focusing on current concepts and practices concerning relationships between the Union and municipalities. These relationships are characterized and discussed taking into account federal cooperation in education, the system of cooperation between education systems and the technical and financial assistance from the Union at the basic education level. Joint political actions between the Union and municipalities are understood based on the notion of regulation of public action and are distinguished as part of constitutive processes of a new regulation in public action.

Abstract: Nowadays Spanish universities present a horizontal segregation by gender, manifested by an unequal distribution of students, and a vertical segregation, manifested by the imbalance concerning representation in governmental bodies. In University of Seville the percentage of men is nearly twice the percentage of women among the teaching and research personnel. The aim of this paper is to study the image that women in the governmental bodies of the University of Seville project on the faculty, to analyze possible gender imbalance. This is a quantitative research complemented with qualitative techniques. The incorporation of women in such positions and the image projected highlight their contributions to the improvement of our society, favoring, also, the dismantlement of the so-called "glass ceiling".

The purpose of this study is to analyze the issues covered in Jornal Fêmea, a monthly newspaper published by CFEMEA - Feminist Center for Studies and Advisory Services. For methodological reasons, the study only analyzes the editions published between 1992 and 2002, thus carefully examining a decade of content. It considers in what ways Jornal Fêmea tackles topics of interest for women and feminists in its various types of texts: editorials, feature reports, articles, interviews, and notifications. The aim is to assess what changed, in terms of subject matter, over this ten-year period. What are the demands of the women's and feminist movements in the early 21st century? More aptly, considering their primary goals and needs in the early 90s, what has been accomplished to date? What current challenges are important enough to merit coverage in the media? In general, it is clear that while new topics have arisen in recent years-such as budgetary issues-old topics still infuse debate and mobilization, and are echoed in small and large means of communication alike. The continued relevance of these issues stems from the fact that, in the 21st century, besides struggling to broaden women's rights, it is also necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already conquered. Existing rights are now threatened by factors such as the growth of fundamentalist ideologies, liberalization of labor legislation, etc. These pressures are typical of an increasingly globalized and capitalist world.

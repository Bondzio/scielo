Abstract This is a documental and socio-anthropological research about the International Consortium for Emergency Contraception&#8217;s arguments (ICEC) to expand the Emergency Contraception (EC) access to women in &#8220;developing countries&#8221;. Three theoretical perspectives have been identified: the sanitary, the pharmaceutical and the one about the rights. This work allows us to reflect on Consortium&#8217;s meanings for ECs, like biomedical and sanitary devices that must be constituted as a right to women as they enable the reproductive autonomy exercise.

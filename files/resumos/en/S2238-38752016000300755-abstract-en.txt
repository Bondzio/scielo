Abstract This article outlines an approach to the anthropological analysis of moral as an integral part of the production of social life by concrete, socially situated individuals. I attempt a reading of Émile Durkheim's writings on moral that differs from the current orthodoxy commonly found in anthropological studies. I search guidelines to define the domain of morality, to analyse its relationships with human action, and to integrate it with human cognition. I illustrate my point of view with an ethnographic account of the moral dimension of the conflicts that occurred in a fishing cooperative on the shore of the Paraná river in Argentina.

From the choosing of the 'right' present to the arrangement of the    'appropriate' party theme, an enormous pressure is exerted upon mothers to maintain    social equilibrium through the circulation of their children and gifts amongst    and across households. Ethnographic research in Britain suggests that the economic    growth of children's party provision and services is coupled with a popular    discourse that laments the loss of 'authentic' kinship-based birthday parties    and home-made provisioning. In contrast to this spoken discourse, this article    reveals how women in fact avidly embrace market goods and services; as a means    of generating a culture of sameness that avoids the risks (to the motherhood    as a collective, localised phenomenon) of exceptional or overtly accomplished    mothering. Commercialised, mass produced goods and birthday services are used    as a means of limiting expressive gift relations and hospitality. In this sense,    the search for sameness, through the cultural practice of making children's    parties, is at once liberating and potentially oppressive in its strive for    the normative and its inadvertent exclusion of 'other' care-givers. Furthermore,    children and their related material culture are consumed, through the birthday    party circuit, as a means of generating specific types of mothering. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>Keywords: </B>children's birthday parties,    contemporary motherhood, gifts, material culture. </font></p> <hr size="1"  noshade>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>RESUMO</B></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Festas de anivers&aacute;rio infantil, e o consumo    ligado a elas, formam uma parte integral do processo social da cria&ccedil;&atilde;o    dos filhos na cultura de consumo contempor&acirc;nea. Da escolha do presente    "certo" &agrave; prepara&ccedil;&atilde;o do tema "apropriado"    para a festa, uma grande press&atilde;o &eacute; exercida sobre as m&atilde;es    para manter um equil&iacute;brio atrav&eacute;s da circula&ccedil;&atilde;o    de suas crian&ccedil;as e seus presentes entre e al&eacute;m das fam&iacute;lias.    Uma pesquisa etnogr&aacute;fica na Gr&atilde;-Bretanha sugere que o crescimento    econ&ocirc;mico dos preparativos e servi&ccedil;os para festas infantis est&aacute;    ligado a um discurso popular que lamenta a perda da festa de anivers&aacute;rio    "aut&ecirc;ntica", baseada na rela&ccedil;&atilde;o familiar e nos    preparativos feitos em casa. Em contraste a este discurso falado, este artigo    revela como as mulheres, na verdade, adotam com avidez produtos e servi&ccedil;os    do mercado, como uma forma de gerar uma cultura da mesmice que evita os riscos    (&agrave; maternidade, como um fen&ocirc;meno coletivo e localizado) de uma    cria&ccedil;&atilde;o dos filhos incomum ou declaradamente realizada. Os produtos    e servi&ccedil;os para anivers&aacute;rios comercializados e produzidos em massa    s&atilde;o usados como um meio de limitar as rela&ccedil;&otilde;es expressivas    de presentes e hospitalidade. Neste sentido, a busca pela mesmice, atrav&eacute;s    da pr&aacute;tica cultural de fazer festas infantis, &eacute; ao mesmo tempo    libertadora e potencialmente opressiva em seu esfor&ccedil;o pela exclus&atilde;o    normativa e inadvertida de "outros" cuidadores. Al&eacute;m disso,    as crian&ccedil;as, e a cultura material relacionada a elas, s&atilde;o consumidas    atrav&eacute;s do circuito de festas de anivers&aacute;rio, como um meio de    gerar tipos espec&iacute;ficos de cria&ccedil;&atilde;o dos filhos. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>Palavras-chave: </B>cultura material, maternidade    contempor&acirc;nea, festas de anivers&aacute;rios de crian&ccedil;as, presentes</font></p> <hr size="1"  noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was Barbie last year for my girl, Batman      for the boy &#150; with all the trimmings it came to over &#163;300 a party;      and that was working to a budget. (Miranda, 34, mother). </font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tessa &#91;ten year old daughter&#93; was invited to      a friend's birthday party in the summer at a top London restaurant. The kids      were all driven by chauffeured limousine, had a four-course meal and then      went on to a West End &#91;theatre&#93; production. I mean, that's ridiculous what      can a ten year old expect next? (Gillian, 36, mother). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Over the last decade the children's birthday    party has emerged as a key arena of mass consumption that generates an enormous    range of specialised commercial merchandising, services and products ranging    from Disney themed disposable tableware to mini-marquees for the garden. As    a mode of cultural activity that spans the intimacy of familial relations and    established traditions of commemoration, consumption and aesthetic discourse    around birthday parties offers a unique insight into the contradictory nature    of contemporary parenting.<a href="#nt01"><SUP>1</SUP></a> <a name="tx01"></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The typical contemporary child's home-birthday    party commonly involves the careful selection of a theme (Barbie, Harry Potter,    pirates, wizards and dragons, fairies and queens etc); the making or buying    of the ideal cake; the choice of miniature items for guests' 'gift-bags'; the    co-ordination of age-appropriate games and activities; the purchasing or making    of party clothes or fancy dress outfits; the selection of party plates, cups,    hats and tablecloths; the making or shopping for desirable party treats and    snacks and, most importantly, the careful selection of just the right number    and range of party guests. These selections are weighed heavily against the    myriad of choices exercised by other parents at previous parties and the potential    choices of future parties. Hence the children's birthday party occupies, besides    its obvious role as a marker of age, a heightened temporality as a genre of    consumption. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As British children's parties have evolved as    more elaborate affairs, they have also become increasingly commercialised. Enterprises    such as, McDonalds fast-food outlets, Kid Zone play activity areas and Party    Pieces catalogue (selling ephemeral wares exclusively for children's parties)    are widely incorporated into children's party planning across Britain. Smaller    scale enterprises, such as one-off 'bouncy castle' rentals, and the 'Paint Your    Own Pottery' party shops that have emerged in streets corners with child-centred    demographics, are testament to the enormous economic and social significance    of the birthday party. Given the enormous amount of labour and social anxiety    generated by the typical infant's birthday party in recent years, it is perhaps    not surprising that such parties have become increasingly commercialised, incorporating    the paid services or venues of external companies or 'specialists' as a means    of assuaging the enormous organisational pressure. As cultural geographers,    sociologists and cultural economists (McKendrick; Bradford; Fielder, 2000; Otnes;    Nelson; McGrath, 1995; Zelizer, 2002) have identified, the children's birthday,    either commercial or home-based, is a social and consumption ritual that is    gaining, rather than waning, in significance in contemporary consumer society.<a href="#nt02"><SUP>2</SUP></a> <a name="tx02"></a>    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Does the burgeoning culture of children's parties    signal the vibrancy of neighbourly relations and friendships? Or is this commercialisation    of an idealised facet of domestic work, the preparing for and shepherding of    a child through the symbolically pertinent social ritual of the birthday, yet    more evidence of the penetration of market forces into the sacrosanct non-economic    worlds of children and motherly love? </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Using excerpts from a broader ethnography of    household consumption in north London,<a href="#nt03"><SUP>3</SUP></a> <a name="tx03"></a> this chapter explores the    intersection of commerce and mothering and argues that birthday parties are    rarely organised as singular expressions of parental/child relations but rather    as part of a broader gendered sociality in which networks of gifts and children    are circulated in rounds of reciprocity. The increasingly aestheticized and    elaborated nature of children's parties and their intertwining of material culture,    social relations and commerce is a form of consumption that is not merely an    extension of women's domestic work, but is rather a testament to the ways in    which mothering and consumption have become a mutually constitutive phenomenon    (see Clarke, 2004). It might be convenient to represent the careful preparation    of the party event, and the sophisticated gift-giving culture negotiated between    mother and child in the attendance of rounds of reciprocal birthday parties,    as being redolent of a social anthropologist's classic model of 'authentic'    feminised non-market sociality. On the contrary, however, this article suggests    that it is through (rather than despite) the appropriation of the market, in    the form of mass-produced food, decorations and material culture, commercially    hired venues that women as mothers attempt to subvert the tyranny of idealised    roles as carers and negotiate alternative renditions of being a 'mother'. It    also considers how mothers situate themselves in social class terms through    their children and related ethics around consumption as seen the spectacle of    the birthday party. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Potlatch and Lucky Bags: Making the Perfect    Party </b> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On Jay Road, an ordinary street in North London,<a href="#nt04"><SUP>4</SUP></a> <a name="tx04"></a>    Julie, the mother of a six-year-old girl, laments that a mother 'unfortunate'    enough to have their child's birthday fall in August (between school in-take    years) might have attended over twenty parties since the previous September    due to the number of friends her child has accumulated. The sheer financial    and organisational labour led many mothers to be increasingly ambivalent about    "the snowball effect" of arranging and attending party after party,    and buying a seemingly endless round of suitable birthday presents. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Belinda, a mother of three children living in    a street adjacent to Jay Road, observes that the 'party circuit' seems to have    expanded in size, and lavishness since she was a child brought up in the same    neighbourhood. Her own children expect birthday parties at commercial venues    (such as a paint-gun play centre or water-world theme park) at enormous cost,    and Belinda wonders whether this signals a shift in her own class mobility or    a general boom due to increased consumerism and the increasing 'pester power'    of children; </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's just a different world to the one I was      brought up in. I think they just make life so difficult for people these days      &#150; all this...we never had birthday parties when I was younger we had      family birthday parties &#150; we had a few cousins come over and that was      it &#150; and it was much easier and it was much less harassment for my mother.      I think it's a bit of 'keeping up with the Joneses'. </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although, in the past, Belinda keenly organised    extravagant children's parties at home and expensive 'themed' activity-events    in commercial venues, she describes more recent attempts to 'opt-out' of an    'escalating party scene' by introducing a price-cap on her ten-year old son    Jake's parties and suggesting simpler options &#150; like a football match with    friends in the local park followed by burgers and chips at home. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Julie and Belinda try to find ways to negotiate    the sheer enormity of the commitment to children's parties with 'down-sizing'    strategies, round the corner Camilla Knowles, mother of four young children,    day-dreams about themes and novelties for her children's parties. In the summer    her three-year-old daughter, Caitlin, had a 'gypsy' party and Camilla made a    cake in the shape of a Romany caravan surrounded by fresh flowers (as described    in the opening quotation). She made 'lucky-bags' (party gifts bags) from hand-painted    muslin filled with 'lucky charm' sweets and novelties that she had collected    on numerous shopping trips for the fifteen child-guests to take away at the    end of the party, along with a slice of birthday cake in monogrammed cake tins.    Camilla is particularly proud of the unique party-bag gifts, small raffia donkeys    and horses, which she bought whilst on holiday in a remote Italian village,    as there is absolutely no equivalent in the local shops and they cost only 50    pence each. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Camilla is well known amongst mothers in and    around Jay Road as she attends many National Childbirth Trust (NCT)<a href="#nt05"><SUP>5</SUP></a> <a name="tx05"></a>    mothers' meetings and events and is dubbed ' super-mum' by her peers due to    her unflappable ability to deal with four excitable young children and run a    'homely' household. Her home, a terraced Victorian house on one of the leafy    streets adjacent to Jay Road, is given over entirely to the children who are    allowed to play unhindered in all areas of the house. Camilla is a fulltime    mother and the family live on the husband Jeremy's income as a trainee barrister.    The 'romantic' chaos of the Knowles' home is often evoked by other mothers,    familiar with Camilla and her style of liberal and creative mothering, as an    idyllic scene of domesticity. Mothers on Jay Road marvel at Camilla's birthday    parties and view them as the pinnacle of a mode of creative mothering in which    attention to detail is manifest, not in scraping old, dried baby food from a    high-chair, but in icing roses on a birthday cake. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jenny, a middle-class mother living in the leafy    side of the London suburb, is typical in her aspiration to provide an original    party theme that will please both her seven-year old daughter and the unspoken    aesthetic rules of the mothers of her daughter's friends. The party should incorporate    some 'home-made' elements as a measure of commitment and housewifely skill;    but it should not exceed a certain measure of domestic creativity in the event    that it might look too forced or 'keen'. Jenny was particularly sensitive to    what she described as 'the balancing act' involved in making a good party as    she had recently attended an event with her seven-year old that left her feeling    wholly 'inadequate'; </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There it was, in the middle of a table strewn      with fresh rose petals; a home-made birthday cake in the shape of a Romany      caravan. I mean, I'm not joking! It had coloured icing curtains and chocolate      Flake wheels. The gift bags, napkins and plates and everything ...everything      was co-ordinated with the 'folky-Gypsy' theme. ...all for a bunch of three      year olds who'd rather have been stuffing their faces at McDonalds anyway!      </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The overt anti-commercialism of Camilla's party,    as described from the perspective of a local mother, is the highest form of    ostentation and a betrayal of normative notions of contemporary motherhood generated    amongst the socialising middle-class mothers in locality. While 'natural' home-made    goods (like non-medicalised birth) might be the acknowledged ideal, to acquiesce    to the pressures of modern motherhood through the purchase of 'short-cut' convenient    products of commercialism (such as packet cooking dough, plastic gifts, etc)    is the unspoken but widely recognised and admired reality. The dialectic relation    of the consumptive ideal (as expressed in Camilla's party) and the consumptive    reality (as exemplified by McDonald's corporate parties), and its constant negotiation,    sustains the communality of local mothers.<a href="#nt06"><SUP>6</SUP></a> <a name="tx06"></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course, much of the idealisation of Camilla's    birthday parties is a type of exaggerated consensual projection generated by    other mothers, rather than a social reality. For they construct Camilla's efforts    in opposition to their collectively experienced 'failure' in managing the perfect    reciprocal event as a means of re-instating the acceptability of incorporating    consumer goods and services into their mothering. It is in the form of chat    and gossip, at coffee mornings and at other children's birthday parties, that    such opinions are generated. And mothers in Camilla's social circle openly confide    their dread at having Camilla's children attend their parties in case they are    showed up by trotting back home with 'embarrassing, tacky gift-bags' the contents    of which had not been sourced in a rustic Italian village but rather Woolworths    cheap department store on the local high street. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Children's birthday parties, their organisation,    design and orchestration could simplistically be viewed as the epitome of the    'invisible labour' of the gendered work of caring (Devault, 1991); for, as highly    valorised spectacles, parties reveal the otherwise unseen consumptive and aesthetic    skills of everyday nurturance. But the social pressure, escalating expense and    public display of contemporary children's parties is perhaps most easily analogous    to that of the anthropological 'potlatch' famously described by (Mauss, 1954)    as a <I>prestation totale </I>whereby the exchange involved the total social    personalities of the exchangers (Davis, 1992, p. 7). The 'potlatch', a highly    symbolic event of conspicuous consumption, in which those that have received    goods and gifts strive to give more in order to preserve and increase their    social power and standing, was understood by Mauss as the anti-thesis of the    rational exchange which typified industrialised societies. Certainly, there    can be no 'rational' explanation for the expenditure (in terms of time and money)    incurred by households in the organising and funding of children's parties,    the expense of which most often contrasted sharply with the budgetary constraints    of householders on the street. But neither is this merely a model of economic    instrumentalism, whereby household resources are implemented in the acquiring    of social status and the expansion of its social resources (Anderson; Bechhofer;    Gershuny, 1994; Wallman, 1984). Why, then, do women (as mothers) feel compelled    to invest in this seemingly stressful, emotionally exhausting and resource-sapping    round of socially pressured parties they view with such ambivalence? </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In an extensive, North American based study of    children's birthday parties, sociologists Otnes, Nelson and McGrath (1995) argue    that the event is principally used by mothers in the socialisation of their    children through the use of 'ritual artefacts, scripts, performance roles and    the ritual audience to teach children both general knowledge and values, and    specific behaviours necessary for the successful participation in this ritual'    (Otnes; Nelson; McGrath, 1995, p. 622). Many of the acts of socialization identified    in the Otnes et al. study revolve around the steering of infants away from unacceptable    commercial party themes to less offensive versions. At the time of their research,    Ninja Turtles (fighting cartoon characters) held much currency on popular children's    TV and several of the mothers spent much time persuading their sons to opt for    a 'less aggressive' party theme. Numerous mothers in the study also expressed    anxiety over allowing competitive games at their parties and tried to engage    the children in democratic activities in which 'everyone wins'. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gift-giving similarly provoked anxiety in the    mothers in Otnes' et al's study. Whilst the excited unwrapping of gifts formed    the focus of the party, mothers keenly sought to avoid expressions of wanton    materialism by promoting their child's 'graciousness' in receiving presents    (particularly unwanted gifts). The giving of 'lucky bags' at the end of the    party was a means, like the preference for non-competitive games, of ensuring    all children experienced recognition and reward. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The authors, then, consider every facet of the    child's birthday party, from its planning through to the flavour of its cake    and the unwrapping of gifts, as a series of opportunities for the mother's direct    socialisation of the child. The acute attention to detail and the anxiety invoked    by the children's parties is accounted for solely in the mothers' driving (and    apparently innate) desire to appropriately educate their child in the appropriate    manners and mores of contemporary social ritual.<a href="#nt07"><SUP>7</SUP></a> <a name="tx07"></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mothers from the Otnes et al. study are middle    class, fully employed and the majority are Caucasian and married with two children.    As they are taken from the same work based day-care centre (a state University    in the Mid-West) they most likely also share some broader values or at the very    least encounter each other in child-related social situations. In other words,    these women belong to some rendering of localised mothering. What, then, if    we were to invert the emphasis of the Otnes study and instead suggest that the    objects of anxiety where not in fact the children, but rather were the mothers    themselves? The birthday party is an opportunity to publicly display notions    of 'good' or 'appropriate' mothering, and the appeal to children to show graciousness    in opening presents, and restraint in eating chocolate cake is as much directed    towards the 'other mothers' as it is to the child itself. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For Harriet Smith, on Jay Road in North London,    birthday parties are an enormous source of anxiety. As a comparatively shy person    herself, Harriet is eager to encourage her three-year old daughter, Sara, to    develop social confidence. Like Camilla, Harriet attends NCT 'get-togethers'    but her approach to childcare and household organisation differs greatly from    the liberal chaos of the Knowles' home. Harriet, who has just one child, keeps    an immaculate home with pristine d&eacute;cor and toys fastidiously stored away    in labelled boxes in an under-stair toy cupboard. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A recent incident in which Sara refused to share    her toys with a child of a visiting mother, led Harriet to feel embarrassed,    ashamed and annoyed by her daughter's behaviour which had 'shown her up'. Although    Harriet and her husband Bob live in a larger than average Victorian house in    a road adjacent to Jay Road, the family depends on Bob's fluctuating wage as    an electrician and consequently the couple budget conscientiously. Except for    the local NCT gatherings, Harriet is socially isolated and has only recently    started attending the round of children's birthday parties in the neighbourhood.    This has meant the acquisition an entirely new set of outfits for Sara; 'We've    had a lot of birthday teas lately so I've noticed a lot of the girls wear dresses    to that. But usually it's leggings and jumpers, dungarees things like that,    but I put her in a dress for the parties.' </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At first glance, this ethnographic excerpt appears    to substantiate the idea of children's parties as a key arena of socialisation,    used didactically by mothers whose sole concern is the social betterment of    their offspring. But Harriet's desire for her daughter to 'behave properly'    and wear the right clothes at birthday teas (dresses as opposed to everyday    androgynous clothing) is inextricably bound to her desire to 'fit-in' to the    local modes of mothering. Harriet is exceptional in the level of her insecurity    and self-consciousness regarding 'doing the right thing', but she is by no means    exceptional in her tendency towards perpetual comparison and a heightened consciousness    of 'other' mothers. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Penny, mother of a three-year-old daughter living    on Jay Road, recalls one incident, in which the addition of Smarties &#91;branded    multi-coloured chocolate sweets&#93; to a party caused much consternation amongst    the mothers: </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We never give sweets, I mean sweets would be      probably a kind of class thing but basically sweets are never on offer at      an our mothers' meetings...In our group there is quite a good sense of tolerance      for other people's, you know, there was that kind of incident a couple of      weeks ago we went to the first &#91;in a round of&#93; 3rd birthday part&#91;ies&#93; ...      it was done by one of the mothers who is, who probably has the same attitude      as me; "they love Smarties, it's a party, &#91;so&#93; give them Smarties".      I was sitting next to my friend whose child has not had sweets and &#91;she&#93; said,      "this is the end of my beautiful pure-bred". I said, "Yes it      is, it is. You have to accept she's going to come to these birthdays".      And so we were laughing at the whole thing, and she agreed that that was the      end really. And I said, "look you've given her a good start. She'll just      have to learn that there are limitations". </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As revealed in the interaction above, it is through    such events and exchanges that consensus is made through the process of mothering;    in this case in reaching accord over the cultural acceptability of branded sweets.    The woman responsible for organising the first in a round of birthday parties    for three-year peers, clearly broke a sacred, but unwritten, rule regarding    the exposure of infants to impurities such as sugar. The act of offering inappropriate    food-stuffs to infants within the group might have been deemed wholly unacceptable;    thus placing the initiating mother in an uncomfortable position (exposing, as    she is, the disjuncture of her values to those of the broader group of mothers).    However, the transcendent nature of the event (children's birthday party) is    deemed by at least one mother (who then goes on to persuade another mother)    as a perfect justification for the challenging or breaking of previously established    values within the group. In this way consensus is generated and negotiated amongst    the women over 'mothering' through the provisioning of parties and the continued    circulation of infants and children. Although the pretext of the parties is    the children themselves, it is the mothers and their discourse of mothering    that predominates the proceedings; but it is not merely a discourse of how to    be a better mother. On the contrary, interactions tentatively generate around    the everyday ambivalences of being a mother (Parker, 2005); from how much time    one should have to oneself ("is TV okay as a baby sitter for just a few    minutes?") to what is an acceptable level of engagement with the infant    ("do you actually get on the ground and play with your child &#150; I'm    too busy?"). But these ambivalences tend to arise, not in the form of these    direct conversational excerpts but rather through the common currency of commercial    goods and the confluence of taste and mothering style as witnessed in the giving    of birthday party gifts; should baby boys wear branded sportswear or romper    suits; are plastic toys good or bad? </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>'Other Mothers': Making a Sociality of Sameness    </b> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In their ethnographic study of the social contacts    of women with pre-school children in South East England, Bell and Ribbens (1994)    challenged the simple conflation of the terms 'isolated' and 'housewife' that    typified sociological descriptions of mothers in industrial societies. While    it is crucial to consider the change in women's domestic lives in the context    of their work as child-rearers, they argued that the pre-occupation with the    isolation of domesticity undermines the "importance of &#91;the&#93; apparently    insignificant or invisible networks" of women's lives (Bell; Ribbens, 1994,    p. 227). The ambiguity of women's roles as mothers poses (as either source of    oppression or source of power) within feminist discourse is well documented    (Devault, 1991; Everingham, 1994; Parker, 2005; Segalen, 1986; Stacey, 1986)    as is its ambiguity within the context divisions of 'formal' and 'domestic'    economic activity (Ferber; Nelson, 1993; Pahl., 1984, Redclift; Migione, 1985).    For this reason, Bell and Ribbens suggest, social research has largely ignored,    or at best under-estimated, the significance of women's social contacts as mothers.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Isolation, then, is certainly not the automatic    result of motherhood in an urban setting. But the extent to which mother-to-mother    relations offer emotional fulfilment to women raises further questions, as women's    friendships have largely been assumed in social science as an extension of their    roles as mother or wife rather than as a serious object of study within themselves    (Allan, 1996). Women's ability to establish social networks undisputedly relies    upon access to broader resources that differ enormously according to locality,    ethnicity and social class (Tivers, 1985; Wallman, 1984; Werbner 1988). Furthermore,    the pursuit of sociality or 'community' should not automatically be considered    as beneficial or sought after by mothers in preference to a perceived 'isolation'    as women have frequently sought to affirm or undermine certain social class    and ethnic identities through actively distancing themselves from specific forms    of female sociality (McCannell, 1988; Sharma, 1986). But what is clear from    the ethnographic insight offered by this study of children's birthday parties,    is that becoming a mother is as much a social and cultural as a biological process    (Layne, 1999) whereby commercial culture (in the form of gift-objects, clothing,    services, foods etc.) is paramount in transforming everyday domesticity into    the generation of specific types of meanings and social solidarities within    mothering. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As highlighted by Bell and Ribbens (1994) it    is during the early infancy of their children that mothers are most likely to    seek solidarity with other mothers and in this sense the role of children's    birthday parties evolves as children grow up. Sally, the mother of eight and    ten year old sons, living in a maisonette on Jay Road, used to enjoy birthday    parties when her children were toddlers as it was an 'excuse' to get together    with other mothers and have a glass of wine and 'a laugh'. Now she dreads the    time of year around which her children's birthdays fall; 'I used to enjoy spring    but now, oh no! It's such a pressure because it's both of the boys' birthdays!'.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In early infancy the child is almost entirely    a construct of its mother but as this gives way to the increasing agency of    the child, who demands everything from the style of their party outfit to the    types of presents, the mother's ability to supervise and oversee the outcome    of the social event becomes more limited. But also the woman's role as mother    and her own identity and standing within these terms, is less likely to need    negotiation or reiteration as at the early stages of child-rearing. For some    women the prospect of hosting birthday parties for their older children is filled    with even more anxiety; enjoyable only for those mothers with the least to risk,    and the most to display, as expressed by Joanna; </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well &#150; I don't know. I sound as if I'm      being a bit 'classist' here, but I wonder if it's &#91;children's party culture&#93;      more of a middle class thing. That is to say, what I was used to when I was      a younger &#150; we were much more...I don't know whether it's access to money      &#150; having less money than we've got now but I can't remember being invited      to birthday parties. So either I was a very unfriendly or unliked child or      we just didn't do it. Some people seem to thrive on it as well &#150; like      my cousin's 'set', they seem to go to millions of parties and she looks on      it, sort of all, very generously and thinks it's all great. And I just find      throwing them traumatic. I'd do anything rather than give a party I just don't      like it. </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The enormous pressure of children's parties,    the increasing materialism and commercialisation identified by numerous informants,    reveals an entirely contradictory relation between discourse and practice. On    the one hand, like Joanna, mothers spoke nostalgically of the small scale, kin-based    parties they experienced themselves as children and lamented the rise in commercial    intervention. Yet on the other hand, the very same mothers regularly incorporated    party services and mass-produced goods into their party provisioning. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A typical commercial enterprise aimed precisely    at mothers like Joanna is <I>Party Pieces;</I> a catalogue and on-line service    dedicated to the accessorization of children's parties, offering goods such    as fancy dress outfits, decorated paper cups, party games and prizes, banners    and balloons. Mothers receiving the catalogue complete a form listing the dates    of their children's birthdays and receive the catalogue in the post two months    prior to the date of a specific child's birthday. As well as providing ideas    for themed parties the catalogue appealed to mothers such as Philipa (despite    awareness of paying over the odds for the merchandise) as an expedient way of    shopping while creating innovative parties; </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I've bought things from the <I>Party Pieces</I>      catalogue but you can try be a little bit less extravagant really &#150; I      probably wouldn't tend to depend completely on it&#150; I don't think they      are that pricey but the whole thing always adds up in the end &#150; you end      up buying more, rather than if you had just gone out and bought a few white      plain paper plates &#150; if you get the whole thing co-ordinated and masks      and that sort of stuff. </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The expansion of formal businesses into the previously    'home-made' arena of 'dressing-up' and 'fancy dress' costumes and accessories    seems further testament to some mothers of the commercialisation of children's    worlds. As well as catalogues featuring festive wares, more recently a local    woman in the neighbourhood had been organising 'children's fancy dress direct-sales    parties', showing a range of costumes from Dracula to Fairy Queens. Gathering    together in the house of a volunteer hostess, mothers sip wine and handle a    range of children's fancy and dressing-up wear and choose from a stand-up cardboard    model showing prices descriptions and costume types. In general, the costumes    were considered overly simple in relation to the prices charged for them. A    pirate costume, for example, consists of a black patch and a pair of shorts    resembling pyjama bottoms; an ensemble several mothers considered insultingly    easy to have put together themselves. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, Sally, despite being aware that the    items must have been made with a large profit margin in mind, bought a 'beautifully    made satin cloak' to dress her daughter as a vampire as she admitted she would    never have 'got around' to making such an article herself. Other items, fairy    dresses and ballet costumes merely consisting of a piece of white nylon netting    hanging on a piece of elastic, were seen as unacceptable in terms of their value    for money and "too embarrassing" to purchase. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For some mothers the overt commodification of    the catalogue undermines the entire project of the children's party and takes    away the creativity of inventing games, costumes, decorations and prizes. Jane,    for example, enjoys making homemade items, to create a co-ordinated theme. She    used the closeness of Halloween to her daughter Rachel's birthday as a theme    for her fifth birthday party, organised in conjunction with another mother,    in the local church hall. As it was a fancy dress event, Jane had spent several    evenings sewing a witch's outfit for her daughter from scraps of fabric from    a local remnant store. She made jamboree bags filled with 'bits and bobs' from    Woolworth's and had cut out paper decorations to string across the walls of    the hall. Both mothers spent evenings carving out pumpkin lanterns and hand-made    invitations with pop-up ghosts had been sent to around twenty children. A birthday    cake in the shape of a 'scary monster' with the names of the two girls iced    on top formed the centrepiece of the food. Working to a limited budget, Jane    viewed the creative aspect of the party-making as crucial element of its value    and she encouraged Rachel and her small brother to make invitations and decorations    at the kitchen table with her. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The night before the event Rachel insisted on    abandoning her proposed witch's costume insisting instead on dressing as a 'good    fairy'. As well as preparing the party food of pizza, cheese sticks, jelly and    fruit, Jane set about constructing a fairy costume from white netting and tinsel,    to pacify her distraught daughter; </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I couldn't believe it! All that effort and      then she goes and wants to be a fairy &#150; it totally ruined the whole theme...and      she looked like a very ragged fairy. I felt like selling the witch outfit      I'd made to another mother for a Halloween party! </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The disappointment expressed by Jane in undermining    her fully orchestrated event is not unusual. Despite the pressure, sheer labour    and anxiety involved in dressing, transporting and equipping children for their    attendance of birthday parties it is most often the children, rather than parents,    who resist attending the events. On several occasions in the course of the ethnography    there were heated 'scenes' between mothers and children when, often a short    time before the commencement of a party, a child had firmly refused to leave    their home or get out of the car at the venue. As Jenny comments in the case    of smaller events, or those organised around a paid commercial venture, in which    a child's absence will be noticed mothers feel a sense of obligation and pending    disgrace; 'Sophie had been invited to one &#91;birthday party&#93; this weekend but    she wouldn't go &#150; and there was no contact number and I haven't seen that    mum since so... I must apologise.' </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As well as the resources required for the organisation    of children's birthday parties a number of strategies are employed to deal with    the sheer volume of gifts required in the attendance of the yearly 'rounds'    of parties. Jenny, for example, uses a two-tier approach to birthday gifts for    her children's friends (as also described in Sirota's (1998) study of children's    birthday gift-giving in Paris). For general school friends' parties she uses    a collection of Woolworth's items, amassed throughout the year in the course    of everyday household shopping trips. For closer friends' and best friends'    birthday parties she uses the Early Learning Centre catalogue and specific shopping    trips to make selections. She also keeps a bulk of children's birthday cards    in a drawer of the living room cupboard and uses the corner shop 'in emergencies'    if she runs out of appropriate cards. For members of her own family Jenny uses    trips abroad, for example, to try to find items a little more special. Although    family gifts can be postponed, delivered at a later date, gifts for the children's    of other mothers are a more pressing concern and onerous task; </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most of the presents I buy are for the children      to take to parties ...I owe my other cousin's little boy a present &#150;      he was four so I've got to get him something &#150; I've got a huge family      so it costs me a fortune in presents and also the kids have acres and acres      and friends which is good, you want them to have friends, but sometimes the      parties and the buying gifts can be a bit much. </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cultural economists, (Levinson, 2000; Zelizer,    2002, 2005), have identified activities such as children's birthday parties,    and their gift economies, as significant testament to children's economic activity.    Unlike the gift relations between parent and off-spring (Clarke, 2007) the provisioning    of birthday gifts does not involve overly complex mediations between child/adult.    Rather choices of gifts (with the exception of 'best friends') relies on a heavily    prescribed and general repertoire of material culture organised principally    in accordance with gender/age appropriateness and cost allowing the easy circulation    of goods and children in the production of social solidarity. Although, as asserted    by more recent theoretical approaches to the research of childhood (James, 1993;    Christensen; James, 2000), children are not merely objects of socialisation    or 'adults-in-the-making', their agency here is internalised by the mothers    and integrated as a vital part of the cultural and aesthetic repertoire of the    desired birthday party. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anne, the mother of four children ranging from    seven to eleven years sees herself as 'an old-hand' at the birthday party gift    buying. Although her children are now old enough to assert their opinions and    choices regarding appropriate presents Anne still uses a pragmatic 'bulk-buy'    approach to children's gift purchase. During the sales she identifies the kind    of coveted children's items that are still fashionable enough to be sort after    but destined to be replaced by a newer fad or edition, thereby reduced in price    but not fully redundant in meaning. In the course of this ethnography Power    Rangers plastic action figures were popular, for example, and Anne, on one particular    shopping trip, found several items at special sale prices in the local department    stores. She took the opportunity to buy them up in the hope that they would    suffice for a number of parties the children would be attending later that year.    By choosing such fashionable and child-centred objects Anne takes a risk that    they be rendered completely undesirable by the time they are used as gifts thus    placing her children in the embarrassing position of offering potentially 'out    of date' presents. On the other hand she may manage to maximise contemporary    appeal and price, thereby out-doing what she described as the 'rip-off kids    merchandisers' into the bargain. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The type and extent of thought that went into    gifts also revolved around the closeness a mother felt to understanding the    gift repertoire of her 'group'; 'I just bought a jigsaw and it took all of one    minute to chose - not because I didn't care but because it was just right. It's    the kind of thing we buy for each other's kids'. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More anonymous or general types of presents (bubble    bath, stickers, etc.) were often abandoned in favour of 'thoughtful' versions    when mothers felt they knew the mother of the 'birthday' child more intimately.    Celia, for example, used a two-tier price range directly correlating to the    relationship she had with the mother of the child in question; </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If I don't know the mother its less and if      I know the mother and I'm good friends with her then it's more, so normally      I tend to put my price range at &#163;5, that is for or even less now that      they can read I get them books, it's less than that sometimes it's about &#163;3      something like that depending... </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Books and jigsaws are often given to the children    of mothers less integrated into a group, as they are considered thoughtfully    appropriate and imminently practical as they can be easily exchanged at local    shops if duplicated. As well as creating a rationale behind the selection of    gifts, the price limit and gift typing helped prevent further escalation of    a performative party culture that, as previously mentioned, many informants    viewed as potentially punitive. In some cases, mothers identified birthdays    as times when children were most likely to make direct comparisons between themselves    and individuals in their peer groups with the potential for revealing inequalities    of wealth and creating ruptures with the group. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In her study of social solidarity and the gift    economy, Komter (2005) observes how contemporary society has moved from an "organic"    Durkheimian model of solidarity, to one built upon non-committal, segmented    solidarities; 'cities, villages, quarters, and neighbourhoods have become hybrid    and fragmented. Families can do without a neighbourhood if they like, and neighbourhoods    do not need families.' (Komter, 2005, p. 211). No longer tied to mutual dependency    and necessity, solidarities are formed as autonomous entities that, argues Komter,    may increasingly come to rely upon the model of the gift economy to generate    any form of mutually moral obligation. As women have been, and remain, the principle    agents of 'gift work' (Cheal; 1988; Schrift, 1997; Strathern, 1988; Weiner,    1976, 1996) the perpetuation of such solidarities is 'clearly gendered'    (Komter, 2005, p. 192). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just as the fragmented solidarities generated    through the networks of children's parties, mothers, infants and goods generate    inclusion they also generate forms of exclusion. Although ambivalence towards    holding children's parties is not necessarily experienced in direct relation    to the financial security or affluence of a given household, for certain mothers    the obligations of children's parties present an overt form of social tyranny.    Jill a young, single mother with two children (the eldest four years old) living    in Sparrow Court council estate, on welfare support can barely cover the costs    of her monthly bills yet she understands her ability to attend the birthday    parties of her children's classmates as a basic requisite of sociality as a    mother; </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I've been to nearly six so far &#91;this year&#93;,      but it's dreadful because their birthday is coming and I haven't got the money      to buy them anything to have a party or anything. Carrie &#91;daughter&#93; has been      to quite a few &#91;classmates' parties&#93; and one of David's &#91;son&#93; friends had      to go to McDonalds and it's really expensive especially when there's about      twelve or fourteen children and I can't even afford to get David a birthday      card, let alone a party or anything. I feel quite embarrassed when they have      to keep going to parties and I haven't really got a present but I sort of      manage to get something like a colouring book from over the road &#91;the corner      shop&#93; to show I appreciate going. </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another mother, Irene, also living in Sparrow    Court, with a younger son, categorically declares that she can no longer afford    'kids parties'; </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#91;There is&#93; one that day, one the next day,      so I've decided not to have birthday parties any more since they're too expensive      by the time you've done party bags, drinks, games, food and all that. So none      this year, but what can you do? </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For Lola, a South American mother of two children    recently moved to Jay Road, the choosing of birthday gifts for English children's    parties is a fraught task in which she tries to reduce risk to a minimum. Lola    is relatively unfamiliar with the local shopping area and depends on mail order    catalogues almost exclusively for her non-food household provisioning. Although    her two daughters are well versed in the gift and party etiquette of Chilean    culture English birthday parties are a new form of sociality that have arisen    through the girls recently formed friendships at the local school. Lola has    little idea of how English children's parties operate and discovered, for example,    through two embarrassing mistakes, that an invitation is confined to the named    child and does not extend to a sibling. In contrast at Chilean parties it would    be unthinkable to invite one sibling and not another and equally strange for    the fathers not to attend; 'if it's a Chilean party all the family go and all    the men &#150; the family, all the whole family'. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unlike many other children, Anita and Sofia play    a significant role in choosing the gifts they take to their separate birthday    parties as Lola relies almost exclusively on their experience and judgement.    Together the mother and daughters read the <I>Argos</I> and <I>Index</I> store    catalogues and the girls' select the presents, then, Lola visits the shop to    buy them. The most recent gift, for example, was a pink snow-storm globe and    a sewing craft kit bought for Anita's closet school friend. Unlike other mothers    on the street Lola, despite her low income, buys the gifts on an individual    and full-price basis and with only the guidance of her children, rather than    the interactions of other mothers, to help her. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Conclusion </b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whereas Bell and Ribbens's study of mothers'    social networks considered how places and spaces of mothering 'allow' women    to meet 'women of like mind, like children and the same social class' (Bell;    Ribbens, 1994, p. 248), ethnographic detail reveals how women, in their exchanges    of relations and material culture, do not merely reflect pre-existing modes    of mothering and class disposition but rather generate and contest it. In the    culture of the children's birthday parties mothers circulate their offspring,    gifts and creativity in the generation of a sociality which exists in a constant    tension between normative, competitive and expressive relations. Although children's    parties exist across a spectrum of class and ethnic groups, this article reveals    the processes by which certain types of mothering (in this case what evolves    as a type of middle class mothering) might exist at the expense of the prominence    of others. Mothers such as Jill, the single woman on the housing estate and    Lola the South American mother, are not merely precluded from the children's    'party circuit' through lack of economic resources. They are excluded by the    social and cultural domination of other solidarities of mothering at large in    the locality; solidarities formed through endless rounds of children's parties    and its ensuing gift economy. This domination may have real consequences, in    for example, aiding access to certain types of schools though facilitation of    local knowledge or other related resources. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While birthday parties might be understood as    a crude series of escalating potlatches (in terms of the colloquial concept    of competitive gifting that followed the popularisation of the term after Mauss),    in actual fact the parties are far removed from this sense of direct competitive    giving. Rather, they involve subtle and skilful positioning through a series    of normative stages, each of which has its associated strategies and potentials.    While there is at once a desire to use goods and gifts to express relationships    and their depth (honouring a particular mother or child, for example with a    more 'individually' chosen gift) the notion of the 'going rate' for the price    of a children's party gift is crucial to the maintenance of 'sameness'. The    expansion of the previously kin and home-based activity of the children's birthday    party as a form of 'potlatch' (in which increasingly imaginative, commercialised    or subtle variations of a theme are used to demonstrate the mother/child's worthiness    and prestige) is testament to a contemporary British culture increasingly premised    on the 'child' as a social object. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the discourse regarding the unwanted    intervention of the market into the 'authentic' relations of everyday domesticity,    commercial services and goods are used by women to alleviate the pressures of    potlatch party culture, and the potential for overly oppressive, idealised versions    of competitive mothering. For venues such as Monkey Business soft-play venue,    McDonalds fast food chain and Party Pieces catalogue, offer a less risky, neutralised    default to the individually organised event. While American home-making guru    Martha Stewart (or Camilla Knowles) type renditions of creative, expressive    mothering might be popularly aspired to, in this ethnographic context they are    regarded with the highest suspicion as they pose the greatest threat to a culture    of negotiated 'sameness'. The woman most likely to garner admiration is the    mother who 'gets away' with pulling off the most affective party with the minimal    effort and expense, all within the bounds of the accepted aesthetic of the group.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The means by which women generate and perpetuate    sociality in urban societies has been a crucial area of feminist scholarship,    as has been the pressures of externally prescribed ABSTRACTions such as 'respectability'    and normativity (Gullestad, 1986, 1992; Oliker, 1989; Skeggs, 1995, 1997). But    few studies tie this sociality to broader issues of a 'feminist economics' (Still,    1997; Zelizer, 2002, 2005) and the ways in which the commercialisation of mothering    may enable, as much as exploit, women's contribution to the making of the 'social    texture' of society (Komter, 2005). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much literature deservedly deals with the social    isolation of women as mothers, but, as is made evident by the ethnographic descriptions    above, 'mothering' in fact operates as a key form of sociality. Contrary to    Allan's depiction of British social relations (Allan, 1996, p. 103), which describes    men as having a privileged access to the friendship ties and support networks    of the public sphere while women remain isolated within the domestic sphere,    in this ethnographic study men remain almost entirely absent from the social    networks that define the prominent sociality of the locality. Their absence    from the minutely detailed exchanges women make with, and around, other mothers    and children in the course of social rituals such as children's birthday parties,    impacts significantly on their role as potential care-givers (Radin, 1988) by    excluding them from sensitively balanced culture of sameness their partners    have sought to cultivate. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This carefully negotiated culture of sameness    seen in the contemporary cult of children's birthday parties potentially allows    women the opportunity for alternative modes of locally contested renditions    of being a mother. But, as Komter (2005) argues there are also negative consequences    emerging from a kind of solidarity that insures 'some people are excluded from    the community whereas others are included, although sometimes at the cost of    their own autonomy'. In this respect, a feminist discourse that once described    the contradictions of women's consistent willingness to engage in 'invisible'    labour has increasingly turned instead to the minutiae of the material culture    and consumption of mothering and childhood as a means of analysis (Gutman; Connick-Smith,    2007; Layne, 1999; Taylor; Layne; Wozniak, 2004; Zelizer, 2002) </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>References </b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">ALLAN, Graham. <I>Kinship and friendship in modern    Britain</I>.

The article uses the term 'parent'    to refer to any individual (relative, carer, etc,) given the principal duty    of overseeing the child's day-to-day care. This particularly article refers    ostensibly to women (mothers) as the key parenting figures as evidenced over    the course of the ethnography.    <br>   <a name="nt02"></a><a href="#tx02">2</a> For research regarding the institutionalised aspects of    children's parties see Handelman and Handelman (1991).    <br>   <a name="nt03"></a><a href="#tx03">3</a> The ethnography involved 76 households in total and included    a range of ethnic and social backgrounds representative of a fairly typical    London semi-urban street including white British, Southern Irish, Greek Cypriot,    Chinese, Jamaican, Colombian, West African, Pakistani, Jewish South African,    etc. The field site research was initially established in 1994/5 but has been    used for subsequent research in 2004/5 on which this article is based. This    particular article incorporates research obtained though a combination of techniques    including object biographies, taped interviews and full participant observation    in events ranging from shopping trips, birthday parties, schools fairs, jumble    sales, Tupperware Parties and other daily domestic routines. For a more detailed    discussion of the field site in relation to child-rearing see Alison J. Clarke    (2004) and Alison J. Clarke (2000).    <br>   <a name="nt04"></a><a href="#tx04">4</a> The street, the site of the ethnography conducted between    1996-1999 (with follow-up study 2003) as part of a broader ESRC funded project    into consumption (see Miller, 1998; Miller et al. 1998) consists of mixed housing    (state and private owned/rented). Equidistant from a leafy suburban area and    a busy inner city area, the street was described by some informants as being    'semi-suburban' and an ideal compromise for rising children in London. The informants    forming the empirical basis of this article are predominantly white British    or Southern Irish; this is due to the very nature of the article's main thesis.    That localised modes of mothering are made, through the circulation of goods,    tastes and infants, to the exclusion of other groups and manifestations of mothering.    Through ethnographic detail this article highlights how certain informal social    solidarities come to dominate particular localities.    <br>   <a name="nt05"></a><a href="#tx05">5</a> The National Childbirth Trust was previously named the    'Natural' Childbirth Trust as it originated as a pressure group and charitable    organisation promoting breast-feeding, non-medical intervention and 'drug-free'    birth. Although it has more recently aimed to popularise its appeal, its meetings    and branch organisations are still ostensibly representative of liberal middle    class parenting. For specific reference to the local manifestations of this    organisation see Miller (2004, p. 33-34).    <br>   <a name="nt06"></a><a href="#tx06">6</a> For a comparable exploration of the process by which mothers    'grow' by 'giving-in' to the contamination of commercialisation in the form    of their infants' acquisition of Barbie dolls see Miller (2004).    <br>   <a name="nt07"></a><a href="#tx07">7</a> For comparable study of relation between parental edification    in North America and social class differences see Annette Lareau (2000). </font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

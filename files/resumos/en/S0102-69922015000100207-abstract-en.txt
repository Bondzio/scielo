Brazil has not surpassed its ghosts from the past experience of dictatorship. The democratic normality is not been fully accomplished, in spite of the formal democracy and the rule of law consecration. The country was not capable to foster the principles of justice, peace, development and equity to the most poor. The state apparatus, mainly police and justice, still restricted in terms of social control, accountability and effectiveness. In front of so many challenges, it is seen the rise on violence, criminality, organized crime and urban disarray in Brazil main cities. Facing emerging problems, the Brazil young democracy appeals to public and to private security agencies. The armed forces, as well, are called upon in order to maintain order and peace within territory and community boundaries. Are we facing a trend of militarization of public security? Is this trend a new one? Which aspiration of Brazil's globalized society is it related to? That discussion is the main goal of the present article.

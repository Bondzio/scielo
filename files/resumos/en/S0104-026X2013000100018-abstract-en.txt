Taking narratology and queer studies as theoretical assumptions, what is made here is a critical reading of No se lo digas a nadie &#91;Don't Tell Anyone&#93;, Peruvian novel written by Jaime Bayly (first published in 1994) in which is questioned the heteronormative that rules the Peruvian society. For that, we emphasize the subversive potential of a place of literary utterance marked by difference and resistance to the disposals of sexual identities regulation.

Abstract In response to innumerable global challenges in a world ever more complex and interconnected, including a number of public health challenges, the United Nations launched the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; a guideline intended to deal with these issues. Foreseeing their huge complexity, the UNLEASH initiative was created with a vision to gather, on a yearly basis until 2030, 1.000 young talents from all over the world to co-create disruptive solutions for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The School of Public Health of the University of SÃ£o Paulo was selected as the only educational institution partner in South America and was invited to select and send students to the launching event in Denmark in August 2017. The aim of this study is to address and reflect on the seven SDGs (health, food, water, energy, urban sustainability, sustainable consumption and production and education) that were explored in this first event and relate the students&#8217; experiences of this global innovation lab.

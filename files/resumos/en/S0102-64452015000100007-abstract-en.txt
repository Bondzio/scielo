In recent decades, there has been a recovery of a strand of republicanism whose genesis dates back to the ideals and institutions of the ancient Roman Republic. Reconstructed by historians of political thought - and recently absorbed by theorists of analytical and normative persuasion - the "neo-Roman republicanism" revolves around a conception of freedom as non-domination, allegedly distinct from freedom as noninterference, predominant in contemporary liberalism. By understanding freedom as an "essentially contested concept", the article tries to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent is defensible the thesis (put forward by neo-Roman scholars) about the rivalry between republicanism and liberalism as single historical traditions of political thought? (2) What are the main conceptual distinctions between freedom as non-domination and freedom as non-interference? While the first question frames the debate on liberty from the point of view of the history of ideas, the second one does so from the normative and analytical perspectives.

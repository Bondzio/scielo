This study aims to investigate if there is a convergence process of labor productivity in the agricultural sector of Minas Gerais State over the period 1970 to 2006, and in which regions of low agricultural productivity the gap in relation to the regions with high agricultural productivity has been reducing. For this purpose, the state is disaggregated into municipalities, and as testing methodologies are used density distribution and a first order Markov process in its discrete and continuous versions. The results show that the distributions of productivity of municipalities have suffered mass displacement to the left, indicating a worsening in it and its dynamics of development showed a process of convergence towards the lower classes of productivity.

The strengthening of social organizations that made it possible for dairy production to become a market-driven activity has brought about deep changes in the sexual division of labour. The sociological analysis of the changes in family-farming intra-household roles shows that cultural traditions, gender-related power gaps, and social contexts that further deepen differences in market access between men and women are the social and cultural foundations of a hierarchy structured according to sex and generation, where women, especially the youngest, occupy greatly disadvantageous positions. With the strengthening of cooperatives, dairy production began to occupy a rather important role in providing resources to the household, yet the control over the activity shifted to men. This was an unexpected outcome of how the organizations conducted the process of modernizing the production and restructuring the markets, which further reinforced male control over the household production and increased the gender gap with regard to access to resources.

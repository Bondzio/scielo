After knowing about their illness, women with breast cancer start to deal with new forms of perception of their own bodies, specially when modified by mastectomy (breast surgery). This medical procedure has profound impact in body formation. Considering the symbolic and social representations that involve the woman's body and the association of breasts with femininity, sexuality and maternity, I intend to demonstrate in this article how the idea of a female body and the roles associated with it were historical, social and culturally constructed in our society. I also investigate how the symbolic representations of that female body are perceived and re-elaborated by the woman with breast cancer through (sometimes ambiguous) narratives and perceptions, which are, later, used to understand their body after experiencing the illness. The research was accomplished with women of two groups of mutual aid in the city of Campina Grande, PB.

Abstract This paper tries to demonstrate the relevance of Pierre Bourdieu's work for the development of sociological research about social classes and symbolic processes in the city. Based on a reading of La distinction, the paper documents the theoretical and empirical path that was formulated to analyse the city of Porto, in Portugal. With the help of multiple correspondence analysis, the paper shows the relevance of topological perspectives for the understanding of the relations between social and symbolic divisions in the city. For that purpose, the paper proposes an interpretative synthesis about the research results obtained in the city and analyses, with detail, the way these divisions are structured in one of the city's neighbourhoods.

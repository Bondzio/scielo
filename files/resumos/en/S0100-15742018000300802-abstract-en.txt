ABSTRACT The mathematics laboratory is an essential learning space for students of basic education as well as for early teacher education. In addition to the materials and physical space provided, it constitutes a proper space capable of promoting the reflection of future teachers. In this exploratory study, conducted with students in Teaching Methods in Mathematics Education at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, we verified the initial conception of the students about such lectures and how the mathematics laboratory influenced them in the process of critical maturation concerning their roles as teachers. From this study, we noted that the moments of production and reflection on the tasks, in addition to practices with their peers, were crucial in preparing them for their future profession.

Abstract: Following the postulates of sociocritical analysis, in a social context that subordinates the rural to the urban, representations of life in the countryside and life in the city that support the decision of permanence are explored in two songs that express the arguments in favor of peasants about the good life in their rural areas of origin. Focuses on identifying: a) tensions, contradictions and conflicts associated with &#8220;life in the countryside&#8221; and &#8220;life in the city&#8221;, b) intrinsic ideologies in dialogue and c) specific questions to the dominant discourse. It is concluded that, in the context of the study, the categories of life in the countryside and life in the city maintain their validity not as descriptors of two different ways of life, with fixed and substantive opposing characteristics, but as complementary ways of expressing the effects of different and progressive advance of the urban industrial capitalist logic of development on society, including resistance to this trend.

Abstract Based on the consideration that there are many requests today for what students should learn in the teaching of History at school to deal with contemporary problems, this article seeks to question what were the concerns of other ages with regard to the teaching of History, including topics such as the history of indigenous peoples and Afro-Brazilians. The intention is to present, from available sources, without exhausting them, such as legislation and textbooks, what contents were taught, what changed and remained the same over time, without the pretension of exploring, at this moment, the contexts of the bases for such choices.

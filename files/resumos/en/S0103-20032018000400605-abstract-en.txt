Abstract: The goal of this study is to analyze the relations between the agents&#8217; social capital and joint actions developed by the cluster of wine produced at the high altitudes of Santa Catarina State (Brazil). This descriptive and exploratory study uses data from qualitative and quantitative approaches, gathering information from the structured questionnaire and this data gathering was conducted through field research using a interview. The results show a good social capital, highlighting the great level of confidence, which reflects on the joint actions done by the agents. As a result, it has created a nice level of involvement and effectiveness of joint actions, highlighting events organization, joint participation at fairs and events, marketing campaigns, development of products and processes and human resources improvement. There is a small group of agents who show a strong social capital and a proper environment to expand this capital throughout the network. However, the evaluation concerning reciprocity and density represents only one third of the possibilities of this group, and it happens especially because of the geographical distance between the agents who are part of the cluster.

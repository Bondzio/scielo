Abstract The aim of the current study is to assess the relation between socioeconomic indicators and land degradation in the upper course of the Para√≠ba River watershed. The indicators were selected based on the literature and on the census data available. The positive or negative relation between these indicators and soil degradation was identified. The mean values of the socioeconomic index per county (Isec) have shown soil degradation in the entire upper course of the watershed, although predominantly at low levels, whereas the Northwestern area has shown the strongest anthropic pressure. The upper course of the watershed has shown trend to socioeconomic index (Isew) increase and its mean value has indicated &#8220;moderate&#8221; land degradation.

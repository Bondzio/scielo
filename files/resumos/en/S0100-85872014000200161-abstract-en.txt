In the study field of religion and media, the importance of mass media is well                recognized for globalizing religions, such as Christianity and Islam, but much less                for indigenous African religions. This article aims to fill that lacuna by exploring                the media activities of a neo-traditional religious movement in Ghana, the Afrikania                Mission. Analyzing Afrikania&#8217;s changing position in the public sphere in relation to                shifts in Ghana&#8217;s political, religious, and media landscapes, I show how new                constraints and opportunities have pushed Afrikania to adapt its strategies of                accessing the media and its styles of representation. Afrikania&#8217;s politics of                representation is complicated by its awkward position between the,                Christian-dominated public sphere and the practices of the shrine priests and                priestesses that it seeks to represent.

This work studies the Territory of the Old São Francisco River (Território de Identidade do Velho Chico, TVC), in Bahia's semi-arid region. It seeks to analyze appropriation of land by a few hands since the beginning of the occupation of Brazil's territory and its continuity in current times, ensuring and strengthening land concentration. It also seeks to understand the relationship between land ownership - as an instrument of regional power - and political power, as well as to examine whether land concentration in the region ensured centralization of power over time, understanding the connection between the issues and focusing on inequality and exclusion.

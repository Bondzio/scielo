Abstract: The analysis about the National Program for Strengthening Family Agriculture (Pronaf) in Brazil generally mobilize the amounts applied and the number of contracts as quantitative performance indicators. The empirical evidence points to a great overlap in this indicator, the existence of family establishments (EF) with more than one Pronaf contract in the same year. The present study uses the indicator of the beneficiary&#8217;s CPF (Individual Taxpayer Registration Number) to demonstrate that access is well below that indicated by the number of contracts. In 2013, 2,099,279 Pronaf contracts, equivalent to 48% of the EF registered in the 2006 Census of Agriculture, were computed. When access is measured by the CPF, this number drops to 1,154,613 insured persons, which is equivalent to only 26% of the registered in terms of concentration of resources, the average value financed by the CPF registered strong growth in relation to 2008, which is partially hidden if the indicator IS the average value of the contracts. It is concluded that the evaluation of the effectiveness of Pronaf based on the number of CPFs is more precise than the number of contracts, constituting a relevant indicator to improve the analysis of its social reach.

<p>Even though they possess several power resources, Brazilian Presidents also
					elaborate their legislative proposals based upon bills already being processed
					in Congress through a phenomenon called <em>Appropriation</em> of the
					legislative agenda. In this paper I examine the conditions under which this
					phenomenon occurs by means of a typology and a qualitative comparative analysis
					(QCA). I conclude that <em>Appropriation</em> provides the President
					with the expansion of the formal support base by controlling the agenda of
					allied and opposition parties as well as obtaining the "paternity" of several
					policies already in motion in Congress, thus enabling a public association of
					the President's actions and his or her party with the possibility of social
					benefits. Be it in the pursuit of promising agendas or for the maintenance of
					their own dominance, <em>Appropriation </em>shows that Brazilian
					Presidents must go beyond coalition presidentialism.</p>
<p><b>Key words: </b>Appropriation; coalition presidencialism; agenda power; ad hoc coalitions; QCA</p>

<div id="article-body" class="body">
<p>The Brazilian experience, consolidated in the legislative predominance of the Presidency,
			often leads to the general idea that the Executive, with its broad powers and
			self-sufficiency in drafting policy propositions, would make the Legislative a
			subservient power or simply a mere ceremonial stage in the law-making process. However,
			a more attentive eye on the legislative work reveals that, even for such a powerful
			political actor, the mission to govern is complex and requires much more than power, but
			the ability to use them. Furthermore, the set of ideas and perceptions of problems and
			propositions to address national challenges does not exclusively pass through decision
			makers operating within the Executive. In addition to the various forms of influence
			from organized interest groups, we also find the active participation of political
			actors in the National Congress. These aspects create a favorable setting for several
			parliamentary propositions to call the attention of the Presidency, which then seeks to
			act on the legislative process in different ways, among which we highlight the recently
			observed phenomenon of <em>Appropriation</em> of the Legislative agenda.</p>
<p><em>Appropriation</em> occurs when the Executive builds on ongoing bills in
			Congress, as well as the content of the debates and other byproducts of the ongoing
			legislative process, to prepare and submit its own propositions, incorporating
			additional elements to the legislative agenda, and in some cases impeding the
			development of the agenda being debated in Parliament (Araújo and Silva, 2012; <sup><a href="#B36">Silva and Araújo, 2013</a></sup>). Moreover, this phenomenon
			features bills originating from within the Presidential coalition as well as the
			opposition.</p>
<p>From the point of view of policy content, the phenomenon shows different traits and can
			reach a point where the President practices <em>Appropriation</em> through
			verbatim copying of bills in Congress. A typical case was the approval of Law nº
			11.520/2007, which granted special pension to people affected by leprosy and subjected
			to isolation and compulsory hospitalization. This law had its origins in Provisional
			Measure (PM) 373/2007, of which its text and explanatory statement were almost literally
			copied from Senate Bill 206/2006, which had already passed the Senate and was proceeding
			through the Chamber of Deputies when the PM was published.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one can also observe that several parliamentary initiatives attract
			the attention of the Executive in a negative sense. Therefore, by opposing the idea
			being discussed, the President performs <em>Appropriation</em> as an
			intervention on that specific agenda, presenting a proposition tailored to their
			preferences. A case that falls within this perspective was PM 232/2004, responsible for
			readjusting the income tax rate. At the time and under the same subject, circa 11 bills
			were in motion in an advanced stage in Congress, whose propositions greatly diverged
			from the intentions of the Executive Branch. <em>Appropriation </em>was the
			easiest path for the President, presenting their own proposition rather than to work to
			change bills already under discussion. It should be stressed that
				<em>Appropriation</em> cases are not rare or isolated facts. In a survey
			conducted between 1995 and 2010 (Araújo and Silva, 2012) it was shown that approximately
			18% of provisional measures and 40% of the bills had full or partial association with
				<em>Appropriation</em>.</p>

							<em>Appropriation</em> (1995-2010)* </span></p>
</div>
		</p>
<p>Therefore, <em>Appropriation</em> is part of the current practices within the
			Brazilian political system, regardless of the political party in power.</p>
<p>The question that arises is why and under which conditions the head of the Executive
			Power makes use of this strategy, taking into account the system of governance and the
			building of formal majorities known in the Brazilian case, since <sup><a href="#B1">Abranches (1988)</a></sup>, as coalition presidentialism<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>]</sup>. My argument is that in spite of the
			Executive's success rates, the act of governing is not always in accordance with the
			very strict premises regarding this system. Furthermore, while the Presidency's power to
			legislate does have institutional foundations there are also strategic and contingent
			reasons, which depend on the complexity of the issues at stake and the capacity of the
			head of the Executive Power.</p>
<p>Under these terms, <em>Appropriation </em>demonstrates President's capacity in
			determining which propositions shall be taken under consideration in Congress and at
			what moment this occurs, thus showing a clear indication of the power of the agenda, but
			in a way hitherto not perceived within the scholarly debates on coalition
			presidentialism.</p>
<p>Therefore, the existence of the phenomenon gives rise to an investigation of an
			alternative form of association between the power of the agenda from the Executive and
			the formation mechanisms of party majorities, especially when it comes to the hegemony
			of the Executive in passing laws.</p>
<p>So, in this article, I intend to identify the game of interactions within the
				<em>Appropriation</em> and verify under what circumstances this phenomenon
			combines the power of the head of the Executive's agenda with the management of
			multiparty coalitions.</p>
<p>To this end I propose an analytical model that establishes dynamic and conjectural
			relations between the phenomenon and some of the explanatory factors for coalition
			presidentialism. To conduct the empirical test I used a comparative analysis tool known
			as Qualitative Comparative Analysis (<sup><a href="#B27">Ragin, 1987</a></sup>;
				<sup><a href="#B28">2000</a></sup>). This methodological choice intended to
			establish and verify associations between occurrences of <em>Appropriation
			</em>through a configurational view of the variables.</p>
<p>My view is that this article expands the insights established in studies on the
			relationship between the Executive and Legislative, especially on the need to better
			understand the relationship between the power of an agenda and the formation of
			majorities. There are ample opportunities for the insertion of propositions that depend
			on the nature, origin, and priorities, underlining elements rarely addressed in

<div class="section">
<a name="idp6374928"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Majority formation and agenda power</p>
<p>It is the goal of the head of the Executive Power to maintain their political guild
				in power. In order to make this happen one of the guarantees is the extent of
				governability, sustained mainly under the condition that the governmental agenda is
				approved. The two main factors to explain governability in Brazil are the
				construction and maintenance of a party coalition and the power of the President's
				agenda. And both factors are often associated with coalition presidentialism.</p>
<p>The Brazilian experience has shown the ineffectiveness of the President acting
				unilaterally, especially during the Sarney (1985-1989) and Collor (1990-1992)
				administrations. The excessive use of the power of the agenda proved to be
				insufficient to overcome the problems of lacking a majority in Congress. Agenda
				power is seen as a necessary condition, albeit not sufficient, for governability,
				since it depends on the strength of coalitions. The most common view is that agenda
				power is a facilitator in coordinating an already well-structured political support
				base in Congress. For this reason, the majority of research in the field of
				legislative studies concentrates its efforts in the formation and management of the
				coalition party, reinforced by the system's multiparty characteristic. Hence the
				various explanations as to how the President molds or controls the party base of
				support, which makes for the majority of the research efforts on coalition
				presidentialism.</p>
<p>The explanatory mosaic to cast this system as a success factor first came as a
				counterpoint to the notion that the electoral system arrangement would tend to
				exacerbate the politicians' individualism (<sup><a href="#B2">AMES,
					2003</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B20">MAINWARING, 2001)</a></sup>. Under
				these terms the response by <sup><a href="#B12">Figueiredo and Limongi
					(2000)</a></sup> to this challenge signposted that the heterogeneity of preferences
				in Congress would be shaped by centralized decision-making, functioning as a measure
				of equilibrium to the incentives present in the electoral arena. The
				institutionalization of rules within the Legislative Parliament places control and
				coordination at the hands of leaders, which would ensure a high party discipline
				and, consequently, the functioning of coalitions. Under this scenario Brazilian
				political parties, fragile in the electoral arena, occupy a prominent position in
				the legislative arena.</p>
<p>However, when considering limitations present in centralization mechanisms, <sup><a href="#B25">Pereira and Mueller (2003)</a></sup> advocate that the
				existence of rules is insufficient to explain the government's influence over the
				legislative agenda. This control would be reinforced when defining distributive
				policies and offices in exchange for support for propositions agreed between party
				leaders from the governing coalition and the President. <sup><a href="#B3">Amorim Neto (2002)</a></sup> adds that, in order for this to be
				successful, occupation of offices must obey party representation in Congress. The
				greater the proportion between the parties' ministerial portion and their
				parliamentary weight, the more cohesive and consistent will the coalition become.
				Lastly, the budgetary process is also pointed as being relevant within a conception
				that would structure coalition presidentialism. With full control over the budgetary
				process, the Executive allows for a wide adoption of parliamentary amendments to
				use, through leaderships, as a tool to control coalition members voting in Congress
					(<sup><a href="#B24">Pereira and Mueller, 2002)</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, considering the agenda power, the existence of centralization, the distribution
				of offices, and budgetary control, this would increasingly incentive party behavior
				consistency. These pillars support the most common conception attributed to
				coalition presidentialism. However, some studies have raised a point that goes
				beyond the mere occurrence of these aspects.<sup><a href="#B26">
					Pereira, Power and Rennó (2005)</a></sup> presented the first analyses on the
				administration of coalitions over time and observed that the formation of a cabinet
				was insufficient to ensure the Presidency's legislative success. They stress that
				the Presidency maintains the coalition by other mechanisms and by selectively using
				its powers. By adopting this line of thought, <sup><a href="#B34">Raile,
					Pereira and Power (2010)</a></sup> tested the association between occupation of
				government positions and budgetary execution. The authors conclude that these
				political-institutional tools are complementary, covering different aspects to
				ensure the cohesion of the coalition. The variety of situations which demanded a
				selective use of the tools available for the President showed that oversized
				coalitions with high ideological heterogeneity, together with a heavy concentration
				of power within parties, represented severe challenges for the President.</p>
<p>In an alternative view <sup><a href="#B18">Limongi and Figueiredo
					(2009)</a></sup> once again call attention to the power of the President's agenda.
				They reverse the previous explanatory axis, claiming that it is the power of the
				agenda that ensures unity in the coalition. The policy agendas of the Executive and
				Legislative would be defined in a coordinated manner so as to be complementary
				rather than antagonistic. Thus, the agenda approved would not be the Executive's,
				but a governmental agenda of the majority<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>]</sup>. The conclusions reached by the authors, however, were
				based within the budgetary sphere, a process that is largely dominated and driven by
				the Executive.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would still remain important to discover how the fusion of agendas
				within the legislative arena would occur, whose complexity is a complicating factor
				in the relations between the powers. Another issue is to which majority the authors
				were referring to. Even assuming that they mean formal coalitions, the authors' idea
				is based on the absence of conflict or competition between parties, including those
				comprising the governmental basis. Party fragmentation in Brazil entails very
				heterogeneous formation of coalitions and the pursuit of electoral projection does
				not disappear with the participation of the party in the coalition.</p>
<p>All of these researches mentioned above highlight the role of the head of the
				Executive, but the Brazilian scenario indicates that the results achieved will
				almost always impose on the President the use of ability and exertion in conducting
				these processes. This demonstrates that the Legislative cannot be overlooked,
				including its concrete actions in building its agendas, even if its agency occurs
				under strong institutional restrictions. In order to govern, the Executive must act
				strategically in the placement of its policy agenda.</p>
<p>This aspect draws attention to the need to look at Brazilian presidentialism in a
				more dynamic and interactive manner, particularly regarding the association between
				the power of the agenda and the characteristics of the coalitions in a fragmented
				partisan environment. Excessively incisive analyses on the presuppositions
				attributed to the Brazilian presidentialism<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>]</sup> hamper the ability to explain certain phenomena, as is the
				case with <em>Appropriation</em>.</p>
<p>My argument is that partisan and ideological diversity as well as the multitude of
				topics up for debate in Congress do not always make formal majorities as malleable
				as the President's need to govern. Additionally, I understand that agenda power may
				be applied to the articulation of new expressions for forming parliamentary
				majorities, both for the strengthening of formal coalitions as well as the
				construction of majorities, also external to the party base of government support.
				And this is the new way of looking at the power of the agenda as indicated by the
				practice of <em>Appropriation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp6403376"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Analytical model for Appropriation</p>
<p>Since <em>Appropriation</em> is part of the set of practices espoused by the
				Executive, I adopt the idea that it is the result of a particular decision making
				process, albeit inserted within the scope of power of the President's agenda. In
				order to comprehend this process I prepared an analytical model that combines two
				research fronts.</p>
<p>The first refers to the motivations with the presentation of propositions resulting
				from <em>Appropriation</em> and how it articulates itself with the power of
				the Presidency's agenda. Similarly to the claim by <sup><a href="#B19">Lowi (1972</a></sup>, p. 299) that "policies determine politics", I hereby argue
				that <em>policies determine the type of Appropriation</em> based on the
				principle that the occurrence of the phenomenon presupposes its utility to politics.
				Thus, I propose the creation of categories in order to differentiate the
				phenomenon.</p>
<p>In the second analytical front I propose attributes or characteristics of
					<em>Appropriation</em> that may provide subsidies to assess the
				phenomenon as a type of power of the Executive's agenda and its relationship with
				Brazilian presidentialism.</p>
<p>Just like other political phenomena, the analytical model of
					<em>Appropriation</em> was conceived based on the principle known as
				equifinality (<sup><a href="#B14">George and Bennett, 2004</a></sup>),
				indicating that each type associated with the phenomenon is the result of multiple
				causes. As the argument goes, similar manifestations of
					<em>Appropriation</em> can be produced through different paths or
				combinations of selected attributes. With this model we observe the dynamics of each
				type of <em>Appropriation</em> in light of the precepts of a multi-party
				coalition system and the work undertaken by Congress, as well as the varied profile
				in relation to the power of the President's agenda.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp6413504"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Appropriation categories</p>
<p>The first analytical front was prompted by the following question: what would spark
				the President's interest on bills already underway in Congress? This is a question
				that is difficult to be answered solely by considering the existing explanations on
				coalition presidentialism. The fact is that <em>Appropriation</em> carries
				in itself a set of motivations that can be aligned to common objectives.</p>
<p>The existence of the phenomenon suggests that a relevant option for the Executive is
				to present its own bill. By assuming the authorship of the proposition, the
				President would stand as the legitimate idealizer and conductor of a particular
				agenda. Stemming from the idea that the phenomenon is intrinsic to the sense of
				opportunity generated by the agenda being pushed forward in Congress, I opted for
				the specification of the effects desired by the President when using
					<em>Appropriation</em>, based on a construction of categories to define
				the phenomenon.</p>
<p>There are some traditionally established categories for classifying policies, among
				which I highlight <sup><a href="#B19">Lowi (1972)</a></sup>. The argument
				used by the author states that each policy type has groups providing support and
				rejection, and these debates take place in specific arenas, respecting the different
				expressions of power from a government. The categories I hereby propose for this
				research are grounded on different dimensions. I propose that
					<em>Appropriation</em> should be considered <em>a strategy for
					reframing the political game against allies and opponents in Congress</em>,
					<em>by means of which the President attempts to maximize the attainment of
					the government's objectives while opting for the more useful option.</em>
				Through this viewpoint, when the opportunity to conduct <em>Appropriation
				</em>presents itself there is a formal and an informal perspective to be
				considered by the Executive so as to submit a policy to Congress. The formal one
				depicts that the government's central goal, by principle, is problem solving by
				which social justice prevails. The informal perspective addresses the social impact
				in approving a policy. These would be secondary objectives from a social point of
				view, but at the same underlying motivators for a decision towards
					<em>Appropriation</em>. These can be synthesized into categories within
				a pragmatic approach aggregated to the repercussions caused by the political
				cost-benefit of the proposed measures.</p>
<p>Therefore, at first I propose to analyze <em>Appropriation</em> by means of a
				classification of the bills submitted to the phenomenon under two mutually excluding
				categories. On the one hand, the Legislative agenda may be promising to the
				Presidency and other government parties and with positive repercussions. On the
				other hand, the agenda can be threatening to the interests of these political
				agents, which would force the President to submit a proposition that overrides the
				one in Congress. Thus, the proposed bills are classified as <em>positive
					agenda</em> bills and <em>risk control </em>bills.</p>
<p>Positive agenda bills are those that attract the attention of the President since
				they hold greater potential for being converted into political gains. The interests
				of the Executive are expressed in obtaining <em>credit
						claiming</em><sup>[<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>]</sup>, i.e.,
				that the policy would allow members of the government to capitalize the attention or
				visibility in the eyes of public opinion. Within this category we find one of the
				most celebrated policies during President Lula's second term: "<em>Minha Casa
					Minha Vida</em>" <em>(My House, My Life)</em> established by PM
				459/2009. It addressed several issues associated with housing, among them a chapter
				on the land regularization of urban settlements. It was precisely on this issue that
				the government conducted <em>Appropriation</em>, reproducing with minor
				differences an important section of the replacement to Bill 3057/2000. This bill was
				on the agenda of the Plenary of the Chamber of Deputies awaiting to be voted.
				Another expression of positive agenda is the practice of
					<em>blame-avoiding</em> (<sup><a href="#B37">WEAVER,
					1986)</a></sup>, indicating the interest in presenting policies that have the
				condition of nulling other unpopular decisions (such as tax increases) or problems
				that might compromise the government's image (such as corruption allegations). One
				interesting example is PM 169/2004, which allowed for financial transactions of the
				Guarantee Fund for Time of Service (FGTS) in case of urgent personal needs deriving
				from natural disasters. This PM was very similar to PL 3762/2000 and was presented
				at a delicate moment in which the media was extensively covering suspected acts of
				corruption by government officials<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>A reverse situation is attributed to bills classified as <em>risk
					control</em>. In these cases, in order to ensure the prevalence of its
				preferences, the Presidency intervenes in the Legislative Agenda by presenting its
				own proposition. This is done in cases of threats to the <em>status quo</em>
				advocated by the government or in cases where the Parliament's proposition for
				change goes against the President's intentions<em>.</em> The <em>risk
					control</em> category may also be characterized by an action intended to
				control populist urges in Congress, especially those dealing with sensitive issues
				for the public administration. These issues are seen by the Executive as a sort of
				"monopoly", given that the administration's perspective prevails. The President is
				the one interested in any negative consequences arising from an improper handling of
				the matter. They are also policies aligned with strategies to maintain dominance
				over some agendas on which successive governments go to great lengths to control,
				despite the great insistence from parliamentarians in presenting different
				alternatives. Within this category, for example, we find all the measures that need
				to be reviewed periodically, causing a significant impact the budgets of state
				governments, such as the definition of the minimum wage and Social Security
				benefits. The Congress periodically presents dozens of bills on these topics. Within
				it also fall policies pertaining to a more typical state control, such as regulatory
				policies, inspection policies, and implementation of administrative and penal
				punishments.</p>
<p>So that the categories of <em>Appropriation</em> may also encompass the
				Presidency's modulation to the sense of opportunity generated by Congress agenda it
				is necessary to add another dimensional space: the priority level. This is an
				important aspect of the power of the President's agenda, since, by defining the
				speed of the processing rate it attempts to maintain the debate calendar under
				control (<sup><a href="#B10">DÖRING, 1995</a></sup>). The works in Congress
				also interfere with the processing rate desired by the Executive. By studying the
				mechanisms of acceleration of the presidential agenda, <sup><a href="#B23">Pereira and Mueller (2000)</a></sup> observed that the prerogative to
				request urgency in discussing propositions can vary according to the differences
				between the interest shown by the committees and the President. The smaller these
				preferences, the smaller would be the need to speed up work.</p>
<p>At the legislative initiative, the President may submit bills at a normal or ordinary
				pace through constitutional urgent requests or through provisional measures (PM).
				Although any introduction of a government bill should significantly demarcate works
				in Congress, it is natural that those with a higher priority shall occupy most of
				the legislative debate. As for the PMs, they are the most effective form for the
				Executive to legislate and to quickly convert its propositions into laws. Its
				effects are immediate and the discussion rite in Congress has precedence over all
				others, besides the fact that they are brief. This aspect imposes differentiated
				conditionalities.</p>
<p>For the Presidency it would be much simpler to send all legislative propositions via
				provisional measures. But the reality is not consistent with this practice. That is
				why some explanations are required to justify the use of different legislative
				instruments in presenting propositions submitted to
				<em>Appropriation</em>.</p>
<p>Thus, through the priority level one can observe the selective use of presidential
				prerogatives by means of the speed of the processing rate of its propositions. The
				priorities depend on the interactive game between the Executive and the Legislative
				branches and the level of influence of internal government decisions, be it from the
				Presidency, the cabinet post which proposed the agenda, or even from other parties
				within the coalition. Different priorities also determine different treatments
				between governmental agendas concurrently transiting in Congress. <sup><a href="#B11">Diniz (2005)</a></sup> points to the existence of such
				behavior as being a "hierarchical agenda". The author emphasizes that many of the
				propositions placed forward by the President are merely used as instruments of
				negotiation or accommodation of interests within the coalition. They do not come
				accompanied by the use of resources to expedite processing and are usually left to
				transact according to the timing of the National Congress itself.</p>
<p>Once established that the level of priority varies according to the proposition type,
				six possible categories of <em>Appropriation</em> arise, as shown in <a href="#f03">Figure 2</a>. The lower priority level categories
				are worthy of a few comments. An<em> Appropriation by Positive Agenda
				</em>with low priority level<em>, </em>classified as<em>
					Preparatory, </em>indicates the government's interest for a legislative
				action that demarcates its presence in the discussions of certain agendas. However,
				this presence reveals itself with a higher level of "patience" in regards to the
				power of the agenda, due to the need the proposition has to acquire greater
				consensus and maturation after being sent to Congress. The lower priority reveals,
				in such cases, an investment by the Executive with no expectation of such bills
				being approved. On the other hand, it is also a manifestation of a phenomenon that
				enables the government to gain more time to act at the most opportune moment and
				thus focus in due course in approving its agenda. In this situation the Legislative
				is used as an "incubator" for the Presidency's bills, hence the category being named
				"preparatory". In the same line of reasoning, <em>Appropriation by Preliminary
					Control Risk</em> are those in which the government invests just enough
				effort to ensure that the <em>status quo</em> does not change or is modified
				except under the President's strictly authorized terms. These are cases that
				function merely as a prevention.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="idp6460912"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Appropriation attributes</p>
<p>In this second research front I outline the modulation attributes or parameters from
				which the categories of <em>Appropriation</em> shall be analyzed.</p>
<p>The planning of the various governmental legislative agendas performed through
					<em>Appropriation</em> requires different tools than those available for
				the government to achieve governability. Furthermore, to understand what incites the
				President's interest it becomes crucial to evaluate what is relevant from the
				standpoint of this political agent by estimating the confluent points between its
				propositions and those from Congress. The initial theoretical framework shows the
				set of possibilities available to the Executive as well as the challenges it must
				face to approve new policies. By following <sup><a href="#B6">Beckmann
					(2010)</a></sup> I argue that <em>Appropriation</em> has the
				characteristics of an <em>early game strategy<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>]</sup></em>: an anticipatory movement by starting a
					<em>new</em> legislative game, that is to say, by presenting new
				proposition stemming from those already being processed in Congress.
					<em>Appropriation</em> would take place even before the Legislative's
				final decision and would be boosted by the Executive's ability to coordinate or to
				persuade others of the substantive value of the bills involved.</p>
<p>With this understanding the choice of attributes shall follow the proposed model,
				being divided into two explanatory axes: <em>informational gain</em> and
					<em>party connection</em>. In the first, the attributes will be based on
				the content of the propositions and the set of factors promoted by the legislative
				process which favor the President's interests in Congressional bills. The second
				axis will lead to the choice of attributes dealing with how agents performing
					<em>Appropriation</em> occupy, divide and articulate in power.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp6471712"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Informational Gain</p>
<p>This perspective relates to the substantive part of the "appropriated" agenda, as
				well as all of the work subsidizing the development of the proposition's text. The
				approach here is bound to the origin and as to how the information subsidizing the
				Executive's alternative strategy is treated.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#B23">Pereira and Mueller (2000)</a></sup>, by using the
				informational perspective adopted by <sup><a href="#B15">Gilligan and
					Krehbiel (1987)</a></sup>, call attention to the importance of evaluating the
				President's strategic use of the work from the committees in Congress, both in terms
				of factor adhesion among the preferences from the Legislative and Government bills,
				as well as the stage of such discussions in Congress. The authors underline that
				depending on the works performed, the committees could serve the interests of the
				Executive Power. This perspective reveals just how important the legislative process
				can be as a source of information for decision making by
					<em>Appropriation</em>. When such a decision happens one deduces that a
				range of information was analyzed by government agents (party leaders, parliamentary
				advisers, coalition members), from the content and merit of the proposition produced
				in Congress up to the conditions and actors fostering its presentation.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the path traveled by bills in Congress and its discussion momentum
				indicate the manner by which parliamentarians and parties have handled their agenda,
				also generating relevant information for decision-making by external agents,
				including the Executive itself. On the other hand, the idea that it was
				"appropriated" is the established link between the preferences of the Executive,
				tied to political beliefs as well as governmental objectives, and the
				parliamentarians' preferences. To analyze the path followed by the bills, I propose
				that one of the attributes necessary to understand <em>Appropriation</em> is
				the STAGE of the legislative process. Depending on the STAGE, the process of
					<em>Appropriation</em> assumes different directions. For each bill that
				draws the Executive's attention we need to know the latest product of legislative
				works, so that we can assess how contributions from Congress were appropriated. The
				possibilities of the government finding something of interest within the Legislative
				are varied, but they are dependent on the "informational load" offered by the
				processing of bills. The more advanced the processing, the larger set of information
				will be available by the process (content of the discussions, amendments, opinions,
				which political actors participated, which parties and interest groups are involved,
				among others). Thereby, STAGE is defined by the phase the bill was found when being
				handled in Congress until being submitted to <em>Appropriation</em> by the
				Presidency.</p>
<p>I established four categories for STAGE, described in an increasing scale as to their
				informational load (see <a href="#t1">Table 01</a>).</p>

<p>Once identified the STAGE when bills in Congress were "appropriated" it still becomes
				necessary to verify its level of alignment or distancing among the preferences
				presented by the Executive's proposition. This information is collected under the
				attribute named PREFERENCE.</p>
<p>The closer the Executive's preferences are from the parliamentarian's bills the more
					<em>Appropriation</em> will be characterized as a strategy aimed at
				persuading Congress, even if the bill's origin came from an opposition party. In
				fact, in such cases it becomes quite evident that by taking an interest and
				investing on a legislative agenda led by the opposition, the greater are the
				President's chances to overthrow the oppositional urges of these parties when
				deliberating the governmental proposition.</p>
<p>To measure PREFERENCE I created an index consisting of criteria for determining the
				distance between preferences at different levels. The guideline for each criterion
				was achieved by comparing the content of texts, collating the proposed government
				bill with propositions submitted to <em>Appropriation</em> (see <a href="#t2">Table 02</a>).</p>

<p>When looking at the international experience there are some consensuses regarding
				party behavior and their stance on government support. The characteristics of the
				American system, for example, indicate that legislative prevalence in Congress and
				the control of its institutions are crucial to governability. This requires for the
				President to dialogue, negotiate, and bargain with the party dominating the main
				positions in Congress (<sup><a href="#B7">Cameron, 2000</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B9">Cox and McCubbins, 2005</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The dynamics becomes more complex in European countries, where the presence of
				multiple parties in the coalition supporting the government demand a strong
				governance scheme by which the partners must be able to overcome the tension
				generated between the collective interest (the government's), in a mutual
				accommodation, and the individual incentives (the parties) pursued by each by means
				of their policies (<sup><a href="#B21">Martin and Vanberg, 2011</a></sup>).
				Under these parliamentary democracies prevails a sense of establishing compromises
				on policies and, at the same time, the delegation to prepare legislative
				propositions to ministers, that is, to a specific party. However, partisan influence
				cannot be verified solely on one specific jurisdiction. Legislative institutions
				also allow for the improvement of policies under a type of mutual intra-coalition
				control.</p>
<p>In light of these arguments how would Brazilian parties behave? In a Brazilian
				coalition government with a strong President it is relevant not only to know which
				parties compose the support base, but also to know the dynamics between them within
				the government. The possibilities most frequently cited to reduce potential tensions
				among government members are the distribution of offices and the distribution of
				resources by budgetary amendments. However, the foundations for understanding party
				policymaking still lack depth. From the viewpoint of studies on coalitions, the
				strong interest in verifying which parties participate in the government coalition
				is usually founded on the belief that <em>merely knowing who is in government is
					enough to infer what type of policies will be presented.</em> However, for
				the Brazilian scenario this path still merits further analysis. The parties do not
				make clear the nature of the policies advocated by them and the context of a
				coalition government makes this comprehension much more nebulous.</p>
<p>I understand that the study of <em>Appropriation</em> helps to clarify this
				question as it favors the analysis of the relationship between parties occupying
				ministerial offices and parties in which parliamentarians associate themselves to
				"appropriate" draft bills. Depending on the partisan association between political
				agents practicing <em>Appropriation</em> and those linked to the
				"appropriate" bill, it becomes possible to infer these policies capacity to
				interfere and to shape policies. I named this explanatory axis <em>party
					connection</em>.</p>
<p>Through party connection I intend to analyze the relationship between parties holding
				positions in government and the stance taken against opposition parties. It is
				interesting to note that this aspect takes us to the work of <sup><a href="#B9">Cox and McCubbins (2005)</a></sup>, through which they define that a
				successful party behavior is concentrated in controlling the legislative agenda
				through which they termed "legislative cartel". Party leaders would favor bills from
				members of their same party and, in the opposite direction, would seek to impose a
				veto on propositions coming from opposition parties. For the first scenario
				leaderships would use their "positive" agenda power, by which we observe the ability
				to direct draft laws towards approval. As for the oppositions, the cartel would use
				its "negative" agenda power by not allowing bills to move forward within the
				legislative process. Furthermore, <sup><a href="#B9">Cox and McCubbins
					(2005)</a></sup> emphasize that in seeking control of the agenda, the parties seek
				to anticipate preferences, also conducting a "negative control" over its members. By
				clearly establishing the boundaries of what is amenable to be accommodated,
				propositions coming from outside the party would be blocked, thus reducing the
				pressure on how their members vote. The major difference between the reality
				interpreted by the authors and the Brazilian reality is that the main driving force
				of a "cartelized" behavior lies in the participation of the Executive (Amorim Neto,
				Cox and McCubbins, 2003).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if in the Brazilian reality there is no prior party control over what
				their parliamentarians in Congress presents there may be a subsequent selection
				process by which propositions may count with the support of party leaders and
				receive special referral. I understand that this is where Cox and McCubbins provide
				an important association with <em>Appropriation</em>. Even though Brazilian
				parties lack enough programmatic identity to influence bills placed forward by its
				members, the possibility of <em>Appropriation</em> may encourage parties to
				exercise the role of filters and selectors, especially by means of a governmental
				coordination. This would provide a well paved path for bills with a consistent
				content insofar that they are resubmitted by the President. Beyond the use of
				parties to verify promising bills so as to conduct <em>Appropriation</em>,
				the Presidency may also use this same procedure for propositions submitted by other
				parties (<sup><a href="#B16">Inácio, 2009</a></sup>). Thus, the phenomenon
				may serve to displace opposition visibility in obtaining political benefits from the
				authorship of good policies.</p>
<p>At the same time, <em>Appropriation</em> would also play the role of a
				control mechanism by pointing possible dangers and dissensions that could impose
				harm on governmental interests. Similarly to the legislative cartel theory, the
				Executive may hold negative agenda control, thus blocking propositions from
				parliamentarians within the coalition base as well as from the opposition.
				Nevertheless, the hue brought by <em>Appropriation</em> is that negative
				agenda power occurs indirectly, by presenting competing propositions and not solely
				through other mechanisms such as veto.</p>
<p>Given these characteristics to obtain attributes to the phenomenon, the <em>party
					connection</em> can be disaggregated to detect the President's action in
				relation to other parties so as to know if it was a shared strategy within the
				coalition or if there was some level of concentration in the decision making
				process. Within this explanatory axis the first attribute of the phenomenon concerns
				the party ties to the one occupying the head of the Executive Branch, indicating the
				Presidency's influence power and how representative its party is within the
					<em>Appropriation</em> process. I have named this attribute PRESIDENT'S
				MINISTER. It will assume the characteristic of a dummy variable that registers
				whether the Executive's proposition to configure <em>Appropriation</em> was
				signed by a minister of the same party as the one in Presidency (value"1"), or if it
				was introduced from the initiative of ministers from other parties (value "0").</p>
<p>The other attribute reflects the counterpart relation to the phenomenon, that is,
				with the author or rapporteur of the bill in the Congress' agenda, which was
				subsequently submitted to <em>Appropriation</em>. This attribute, called
				CONVERGENCE, was drawn from parameters aimed at locating the parties of the authors
				or rapporteurs in relation to the President's party, much like a pattern of partisan
				adhesion.</p>
<p>Taking as reference the party of the author or rapporteur for the "appropriated"
				proposition, the CONVERGENCE level stems from the composition of three evaluation
						filters<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>]</sup>, as shown in

<p>The first three situations appear to be similar. It so happens that the coalition is
				multi-partisan and heterogeneous, and therefore a closer inspection is required. The
				argument for this attribute is that there could be a greater integration between
				parliamentarians and the government through their party affinities, implying
					that<em> the greater the convergence, the greater the scope for negotiation
					and coordination, thus benefiting both sides.</em> In contrast, the lower
				the CONVERGENCE, more the <em>Appropriation</em> would be a strategy for
				cancelling or blocking parliamentary initiatives.</p>
<p>The analytical model allows us to explain <em>Appropriation</em> by different
				combinations of attributes, grouping them into similar categories. It means that
				this type of construction admits that there is no ideal format for this type of
				phenomenon, which is consistent with its complexity. From this argument the question
				that needs to be answered is: <em>what method should be used to verify the
					association between the Appropriation categories and its
				attributes?</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp6593296"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Comparative analysis</p>
<p>The elaboration of the categories and the selection of the attributes revealed
				typical characteristics of <em>set-theoretic methods</em> since the data
				represent theoretical concepts and the connections with the analyzed phenomenon are
				associative, and which validity and sufficiency demand a simultaneous evaluation of
				more than one attribute. The very recognition of equifinality as an analytical
				perspective for <em>Appropriation</em> is a consequence of the relationship
				with <em>set-theoretic methods</em>.</p>
<p>The method choice was Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), initially developed by
					<sup><a href="#B27">Ragin (1987)</a></sup>. QCA allows for the
				researcher to study cases from a configurational notion so as to understand the
				phenomenon stemming from the idea of "multiple conjectural causation" (Rihoux and
				Ragin, 2009). This concept is associated with phenomena that are highly dependent on
				simultaneous actions from multiple causes and with causal heterogeneity. This
				configurational notion fits in very well with the argument by <sup><a href="#B13">Fiss (2011)</a></sup> that classification systems tend to be based on a
				"logical consistency", that is, in the adjustment between the different parts that
				make up the configuration with the proposed category.</p>
<p>With this method it is possible to verify that <em>Appropriation</em> is not
				supported by a single attribute, but based on relationships and complementarities
				among the selected attributes. Furthermore, the method allows for a simultaneous
				analysis of multiple cases, an unusual trait in traditional case studies. To
				accomplish this goal, QCA offers operations based on Boolean algebra, whose
				algorithms allow for the identification of regularities within subsets of the
				considered conditions. In this research we applied a <em>fuzzy-set</em> type
				QCA, since this method indicates that relevant objects can have participation
				variations within a given set of solutions (<sup><a href="#B28">Ragin,
					2000</a></sup>)<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>A critical aspect of configurational analysis is determining the attributes that
				matter most within the explanatory structure for each <em>Appropriation</em>
				category. Accordingly, I have adopted Fiss' definition of "centrality" (2011), which
				underlines the causal relationships between attributes and the types of
					<em>Appropriation</em> offering the highest theoretical potential. The
				author suggests that <em>core</em> attributes are those indicating a strong
				causal relation with the result and through which the grouping of solutions occurs.
				In contrast, <em>peripheral</em> attributes present a relatively weak causal
				relationship.</p>
<p>To simplify the understanding of the results generated by the QCA minimization
				algorithms I adopted the graphical notation by <sup><a href="#B33">Ragin
					and Fiss (2008)</a></sup> and <sup><a href="#B13">Fiss (2011)</a></sup>
				within the following terms and interpretations:</p>

				</p>
<p>Observing the overall picture for <em>Appropriations by Positive Agenda
					</em>as to their <em>informational gain</em>, the results indicate
					that the attribute with larger causality is proximity among the preferences of
					the propositions involved in the phenomenon. This truly indicated that the
					positive interest shown by the Executive for a particular policy was attuned
					with propositions already being processed in Congress. The strong presence of
					the advanced STAGE attribute as an explanatory factor for the configuration
					indicates that Legislative works were widely used in decisions pertaining to
					this type of <em>Appropriation</em>.</p>
<p>Regarding the <em>party connection</em> perspective, the results show the
					centralization of powers in the hands of the President's party and its
					preponderance was more noticeable the higher the agenda's priority. Under a
					descriptive analysis of the data we find that 79% of these
						<em>Appropriations</em> were managed by the President's party. We
					add to this data the perception offered by the configuration that participation
					from other coalition parties as agents for <em>Appropriations by Positive
						Agenda </em>showed no consistency as an attribute of causal
					relationship.</p>
<p>Another aspect to draw our attention is the existence of several configurations
					indicative of <em>Appropriation</em> intended to form "ad hoc
					coalitions", i.e., used as an strategy to encourage the Executive's adhesion to
					the proposition, regardless of the political party. Apart from a formally
					constituted majority, similar preferences between the Executive and Legislative
					may aggregate votes beyond the formal support base. As for the opposition
					adhesion is enforced since it becomes coerced to not vote against bills with
					which it shares preferences with the Presidency. To illustrate, 50% of cases of
						<em>Appropriations by Positive Agenda </em>have their origins in
					propositions presented or drafted by the opposition. In another vein, we should
					stress the lack of evidence pointing towards strategies from the Executive with
					a cooperative profile with respect to coalition parliamentarians, especially
					with those not directly belonging to the President's party.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the presence or absence of some attributes pervaded all
					categories, indicating its modulation in relation to the primacy of agendas.
					Furthermore, the priority level discerning <em>Appropriation</em> types
					also indicated the focusing of strategies: the higher a category priority the
					smaller the number of configurations observed.</p>
<p>An additional analysis of the solutions generated by QCA points to the
					possibility of aggregating them based on typical strategies adopted when
					conducting <em>Appropriation</em>.</p>
<p>Solutions "1" and "4b" stand out for underlining <em>Appropriation</em>
					in consortiums with a cooperative regime. They have in common a high PREFERENCE
					attribute in conjunction with high party CONVERGENCE, meaning that the Executive
					conducted <em>Appropriation</em> by means of cooperation with the
					support base, especially among the strongest parties within the coalition.
					Cooperation may occur either by Congress' follow-up work conducted by the
					ministries' assistants or through situations where parliamentarians informally
					submit their bills to the Executive. This cooperation, however, occurs in two
					very different scenarios. In solution "1" this aspect is reinforced by the
					presence of the PRESIDENT'S MINISTER, revealing that in <em>Positive Agenda
						Appropriations</em> conducted via provisional measures we find
					centralized decision-making, regardless of the work already carried out in
					Congress. In solution "4b" some aspects justify that this
						<em>Appropriation</em> is of low priority. At first it becomes clear
					that a little advanced STAGE is a strong indicator that negotiations took place
					outside Congress, and which facilitated the positive interest of the government
					for the bill. Furthermore, there was ambiguity regarding the attribute
					PRESIDENT'S MINISTER. This is a typical case of <em>Appropriation</em>
					as an accommodation of interests within the coalition. However, as there is no
					clear emphasis for approval, this cooperation strategy associates itself with
					the priority level much like a "disguised agenda".</p>
<p>Alternatively, the strategy inferred in solutions "3b" and "6", marked by the
					presence of the PRESIDENT'S MINISTER and low party CONVERGENCE shows the
						<em>Appropriation</em> as a type of blockade to the opposition's
					legislative actions. In solution "3b" the blockade is explained by the fact that
					besides direct interference from the President's party, the positive interest
					was roused regardless of the STAGE where the opposition's bill was found. In
					turn, in solution 6, the distance shown in the PREFERENCE attribute and the
					origin of the agenda mobilized the President's party in order to advance the
					STAGE of the legislative process. However, in this case, the blockade also
					assumes the nature of a "disguised agenda" since its purpose is to limit the
					opposition's scope of action and does not necessarily indicate a firm intention
					of converting the bill into law. This is why solution 6 is within the category
						<em>Appropriation by Preparatory Positive Agenda.</em></p>
<p>With solutions "2" and "3a" we find examples of <em>Appropriations</em>
					with the formation of <em>ad hoc</em> coalitions. Both maintain a high
					PREFERENCE and the protagonism of the President's party occupying the
					government. Furthermore, it can be stressed that the process took into account
					the work performed within the legislative process. The more advanced STAGE
					attribute of legislative works produced propositions which positively caught the
					attention of the Presidency regardless of whether the origin of the bills was
					from the opposition or the situation. The only difference among the solutions is
					that in solution "3a" the causality relationship is less relevant for the STAGE
					attribute.</p>
<p>The formation of <em>ad hoc</em> coalitions is also quite clear in
					solutions "3c" and "5". However, what these configurations have in common is the
					use of this strategy to reach the opposition in particular, i.e., the presence
					of low party CONVERGENCE. Since the <em>Appropriation</em> was based on
					a proposition originating within the opposition, the strategy was originally
					designed in order to induce adhesion in favor of the Executive's proposition.
					This led to a blockage of the opposition's actions at the same time in which it
					strengthened the coalition in favor of the President's initiative. I stress here
					that solution "5" indicates that the formation of an <em>ad hoc</em>
					coalition is also applicable to low priority bills, making it clear that the
					government's main interest is the demarcation of its territory within the agenda
					under discussion in Congress without the need to employ its political strength
					in the process. The advanced STAGE offered a wide array of information, albeit
					not sufficient to elevate the level of interest in relation to the set of
					agendas. <em>Information guide decisions, but alone and in itself does not
						determine the government’s priorities.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, out of all configurations, solution "4a" showed the wider range of
					possibilities and it could be inserted in any of the previously described
					strategies. The solution reveals that the proximity between preferences and the
					President's party centralizing action are not sufficient factors to determine
					the priority of the agenda. The lack of consensus within the government or
					simply the cost-benefit ratios of other political agendas of the Executive also
					determine the hierarchy of propositions.</p>
<p>After the configurational analysis I verify that the perspective of the
					phenomenon of <em>Appropriation</em> points to an alternative use of the
					agenda power that does not present as much adhesion to formal coalitions, which
					ground many of the arguments on coalition Presidentialism. For this to be
					accomplished there should be a higher frequency of cooperation strategies
					between the base of the government and the Presidency in <em>Appropriations
						by Positive Agenda</em>, which would indicate stronger alliances and
					harmony of interests between the executive and its support base in Congress.</p>
<p>The majority of processes were strongly concentrated within the President's
					party. The participation of other parties occurred sparsely, mainly in the
					condition of "targets" for the <em>Appropriation</em> process. When
					another party occupying the head of ministerial offices conducted
						<em>Appropriation,</em> in most cases the phenomenon was relegated
					to an inferior hierarchy among other government agendas, either in preparatory
					agendas or in simple accommodation of interests.</p>
<p>What caught my attention the most were the strategies for forming <em>ad
						hoc</em> coalitions. Its use was fairly common in all types of
						<em>Appropriation by Positive Agenda</em>, with a relevant
					participation of cases directed towards opposition bills. This panorama reveals
					that within these <em>Appropriation</em> actions there is a great
					concern from the Presidency in obtaining the "paternity" or authorship of
					policies that are of its interest in Congress, a tenuous cooperation with the
					support base and a major dispute with the opposition. Thus, in seeking to
					enhance governability, the Presidency seeks to expand its array of agendas in
					Congress, using in a more or less cooperative manner its own support base, but
					also increasing its chances through alternatives initially placed forward by the
					opposition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp6655952"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Appropriations by risk control</p>
<p><em>Appropriations </em>classified within this category demand systematic
					monitoring from the government on policy areas that the Presidency considers
					being its sole responsibility. Being rigidly demarcated, when increased the
					frequency of bills developed in Congress in these areas, that is, the more
					pressure there is within the Legislative for change in the <em>status
						quo</em> the greater the risk and the burden of Executive intervention
					in the debate.</p>
<p>As for the results, firstly it is worth mentioning that cases of
						<em>Appropriation by Urgent and Preliminary Risk Control</em> failed
					to produce consistent configurations, making it impossible to find relevant
					theoretical associations. In the opposite direction, <em>Appropriations by
						Immediate Risk Control</em> display a different scenario. Although
					presenting only one configuration, coverage and consistency indexes remained
					above recommended levels. The result confirms that not only the nature of
					policies, but also the major difference between the preferences of the
					Presidency and Congress were crucial for characterizing this type of
						<em>Appropriation</em>.</p>
<p>The presence of PRESIDENT'S MINISTER shows that there exists party centralization
					upon presentation of provisional measures. Since the set of risk control
					policies are restricted to a few areas there is a natural path for there to be a
					concentration of decision-making in the hands of the Executive, since they are
					topics with major impacts on society and on governmental management, and for
					which the President indicates people from his own party.</p>
<p>
					<!--_ STANDARD  _--><div class="table-wrap">

</div>
				</p>
<p>The configuration also indicates a variation of possibilities. The lack of the
					attributes STAGE and CONVERGENCE in the solution, contrary to what could be
					initially inferred, reveals that <em>Appropriations by Immediate Risk
						Control </em>are conducted regardless of the progress in discussions in
					Congress or the origin of the agenda (coalition or opposition). This goes to
					show that the severity of the risk to the Presidency's interests imposed by the
					Congressional agenda is what determines the Executive's actions. In this
					direction, the Presidency's need to intervene over the parliamentarian's
					initiatives from its own support base comes from the fact that there is no
					control over the bills presented. Under the most diverse topics congressmen in
					the coalition behave similar to the opposition, acting upon whichever their
					particular interests take them and at the expense of guidelines that should
					originate from the leaderships. This behavior, much like the opposition, may
					cause repercussions throughout Congress, calling for a more active tactic from
					the Presidency, not only in order to block such propositions but also to present
					something to replace them.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp6668816"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Conclusions</p>
<p>Within the Brazilian scenario the Executive's success in approving its legislative
				agenda is clear. However, this result gives to a misleading idea regarding the
				President's ease in making laws and that merely by holding powers and a formal
				majority would be sufficient to achieve the desired results. Instead, the
				multi-partisan reality and the variety of topics addressed within the Congress
				impose challenges that constantly demand for a strategic use of institutional tools
				by the Presidency. Our argument is that merely holding these tolls is insufficient;
				one must know how to use them.</p>
<p>In this article we advanced the examination of one such strategy:
					<em>Appropriation of the Legislative Agenda</em>, by which the head of
				the Executive branch elaborates and presents bills based on propositions already in
				progress in Congress. This phenomenon reveals an interesting manifestation of the
				actions of the President insofar as the <em>agenda's content entails how to
					articulate the President's own agenda power with the creation of majorities in
					Congress.</em></p>
<p>Therefore, we observed that the association that <em>Appropriation </em>makes
				between the agenda power and the management of multi-party coalition is not solely
				founded on the principles of coalition presidentalism, even though the Executive
				does not neglect such principles for achieving its intended goals. In fact, the
				phenomenon is a creative expression of the agenda power of the President.
					<em>Appropriation</em> indicates that it is possible to use it in a more
				independent manner, expanding the ability to achieve majorities without rupturing
				the formal coalition fabric. This was well documented in the indicative cases of
				strategies related to the formation of <em>ad hoc</em> coalitions. They are
				interesting insofar as they ensure votes in the opposition to compensate for any
				lack of support within the coalition and assist in understanding the conditions that
				would justify the efforts to merge the agendas of the Legislative and the
				Executive.</p>
<p>However, this effect has important variations, which also go beyond the notion of a
				harmonious coordination between powers. The fusion of agendas and formation of
				alternative majorities are accompanied by a personalization of the propositions.
				Therefore, as for the creation and presentation of policies, the data and analyses
				show the possibility that the power of the Presidential agenda may be exercised by
				having the President's party as the major beneficiary at the expense of other
				parties from the coalition or from the opposition. In order to reach this result
				through a broad set of institutional tools, the President can avoid problems with
				the formal coalition, even when the ratio of <em>Appropriation</em> occurs
				over risk control policies. On the other hand, the President also dribbles
				opposition parties by taking an interesting agenda from them that could provide the
				Executive with greater visibility among the electorate. Thus, in addition to
				increasing the odds of building majorities in Congress and to amalgamate the agendas
				between the powers, the Presidency and its party also gain the "authorship" of many
				policies being discussed in parliament. More than any political actor, the President
				can capitalize on the public disclosure of their actions and correlate them with
				social benefits.</p>
<p>Lastly, an analysis of <em>Appropriation</em> once again places the
				legislative arena as a potential source for policies, in spite of the inefficiency
				of the institutions in Congress to carry out the parliamentarians' propositions. As
				it can be seen such aspect is effectively explored by the Head of the Executive.</p>
<p>It continues to be very important to understand the relations between the Executive
				and the Legislative in multi-party environments, stressing the strategic use and the
				complementarity of the tools available for the Executive in forming majorities. In
				countries where the party system is sprayed into several associations without
				programmatic identity, the maintenance of a formal coalition is a process whose
				complexity imposes high political costs on the person occupying the Presidency.
				Within this scenario, strategies such as <em>Appropriation </em>compensate
				the dependence of governing by coalition without compromising formal agreements.
				Whether in search of promising agendas or maintaining their own dominance, the head
				of the Brazilian Executive must go beyond coalition presidentialism.</p>Translated by Paulo Scarpa</div>

					<p class="subsection-title">Selection and sampling protocols</p>
				</p>
<p>We selected the period encompassed by the presidencies of Fernando Henrique
					Cardoso and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to conduct the research. This option
					emerged, firstly, since we considered it to be important to incorporate
					different presidential administrations to observe if the existence of the
					phenomenon was associated with the type of presidential leadership or even with
					the nature of the formed coalition. Secondly, because they were the last two
					governments to have faced oversized coalitions, an aspect that is challenging
					both in terms of managing propositions originating from the support base as well
					as controlling propositions from the opposition. Therefore, the paper considers
					the period prescribed starting from 1995 until the end of 2010.</p>
<p>Once the survey period was selected, further cuts were still necessary for the
					start of the selection process. The most convenient strategy for tracing links
					among the propositions from parliamentarians and the government, in order to
					verify the presence of <em>Appropriation</em>, was to carry out a
					reverse analysis, by which we first selected bills coming from the Executive
					branch and then investigated the possible connections with propositions being
					processed in Congress. It was then established that each legislative proposition
					originating from an <em>Appropriation</em> process would be a unit of
					analysis in our research. The goal was to achieve a set of representative
					information regarding part of Presidential initiatives, but one which could
					encompass <em>all Appropriation</em> cases within the period.</p>
<p>It would not make sense to speak of <em>Appropriation</em> of
					propositions where its contents are solely from the President's initiative.
					Constitutional prerogatives, which determine the cases of Presidential private
					initiative in the submission of legislative propositions are clear (Federal
					Constitution, art. 61, § 1). Even if we take into consideration that these
					prerogatives open broad possibilities for a rich legislative production, there
					would still remain a large list of issues that could be handled concurrently by
					the Legislative and the Executive, and therefore subject to
						<em>Appropriation</em>.</p>
<p>By researching the websites for the Presidency of the Republic, the Chamber of
					Deputies and the Federal Senate, a survey was conducted concerning all of the
					bills initiated by the Presidency, as well as any provisional measures from 1995
					until 2010. Each one was evaluated in the light of the constitutional criterion
					for determining the Presidency's private initiative. We then started the
					selection phase for the President's propositions that had ties with bills in
					Congress. From this analysis it was possible to observe the
						<em>Appropriation's</em> connections.</p>
<p>The procedure begins by taking each bill originating from the government and, by
					means of keywords from the text's summary and indexing we carry out a search
					using the available tools in the website of the Chamber of Deputies and the
					Federal Senate for bills being processed at the time. In this case, <em>we
						recommended a prior reading of the proposition's summary and text, and, if
						necessary, the justifications presented by Presidency</em>, since these
					texts provide information that helps to identify the main issues addressed in
					each proposition.</p>
<p>Another important factor for this selection is the deadline for the incorporation
					of parliamentary bills for a possible comparison with the Presidential
					proposition in focus. We therefore established a standard selection where a
					parliamentarian bill could be traced until the date immediately preceding the
					submission of the Presidency's proposition. Through this we avoid the mistake of
					taking into account propositions where the President had no basis for conducting
						<em>Appropriation</em>. It is worth mentioning that we did not
					include an analysis of bills already archived/concluded at the time of
					submission of the government's proposition. Although the researcher was aware
					that the circulation of ideas is part of the maturation process of the
					propositions in Congress, it was assessed that the empirical verification of
						<em>Appropriation</em> should privilege active propositions pending
					within the Legislative.</p>
<p>Lastly, after all of the observed details above for the selection of cases, the
					most relevant aspect identifying the occurrence of <em>Appropriation
					</em>is to check whether the analyzed texts share the same policy's
						<em>object</em>. This is the political subfield handled by the
					proposition, the focus in change or legislative innovation desired by the
					political actor; <em>a specific agenda</em>. Obviously, the
						<em>object</em> of the proposition is not "health", "education",
					"taxation", among others, but a propositional action concerning a specific
					issues wrapped in a wider theme.</p>
<p>Thus, the ultimate and fundamental filter for the detection of the phenomenon is
					the <em>comparison and conclusion that both propositions, from the executive
						and the parliamentarian, refer to the same policy object or specific
						political agenda</em>.</p>
<p>Through a comparison exercise it is important to note that we are not merely
					reducing the analysis to a semantic similarity since this research does not deal
					with the similarity between texts, but something broader. The semantic
					similarity does not consider, for example, contextual factors, referring to
					attributes that are syntactically identical in both situations. In this sense,
					the comparison between the objects sought to observe the political structure of
					the propositions by verifying if they have a certain isomorphism, based on the
					consistency of the binding principles and arguments such as the sharing the same
					goals, if there were similarities or differences in the public target, or if the
					propositions shared the same legal or technical definitions as well as
					institutional and organizational tools eventually needed to implement the
					desired changes. Thus, <em>what makes a case similar or otherwise is the
						similarity of these characteristics or attributes that truly represent the
						content and context of the occurrence in question.</em></p>
<p>Application of <em>qualitative comparative analysis </em>(QCA)</p>
<p>QCA is suitable for the multidimensional aspect embedded in the elaboration of
					different types of <em>Appropriation</em> insofar that it deals with the
					existence of different configurations, endorsing the complementarity relations
					among the attributes chosen for this analysis.</p>
<p>The QCA technique applied in this research was the fuzzy-set technique, which
					reinforces the notion of relevance variance in the attributes for each solution
					or configuration generated (<sup><a href="#B28">Ragin, 2000</a></sup>).
					It should be noted that fuzzy-set is essentially an interpretive tool, used to
					operationalize concepts to allow for a dialogue between theory and evidence. In
					practice, instead of working with existing binary variables in set-theoric
					approaches, fuzzy sets allow for the insertion of associative values between "0"
					and "1", providing conditions to clearly distinguish objects that can be
					considered more or less inserted in a given category. I emphasize that the
					entire operation relating to QCA was performed with the aid of the software
						<em>fs/QCA</em> version 2.5 (<sup><a href="#B30">RAGIN
						et al., 2006)</a></sup>.</p>
<p>
					<p class="subsection-title">Data preparation</p>
				</p>
<p>In order to define and separate the fuzzy-sets, the QCA requires data preparation
					in a process called "calibration" (<sup><a href="#B31">RAGIN,
						2008a</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B32">2008b</a></sup>). The procedure
					is performed through "qualitative anchors" by means of which we can define the
					attribute level for each case of <em>Appropriation</em>. It is through
					calibration that one obtains the transformation of variables from the database
					into fuzzy tipe variables.</p>
<p>In <a href="#f05">Figure 4</a> we can observe the codes for
					the attributes and the crossover point chosen for each one of these attributes.
					In the case of variables already showing dichotomous characteristics, the
					crossover point will present the value of "0.5", which is the midpoint between
					the two extremes. The PREFERENCE attribute showed the highest variation level.
					When the approximation of preferences indicates a departure of 50% in relation
					to the original text, it is located at a level that point towards higher
					evidence of tolerance and redrafting the text instead of an agreement with the
					direction of the policy. As for the STAGE attribute, we considered the most
					relevant cases to be those showing larger information gain in the process, and
					where the most relevant processes elected were those arising from discussions in
					a progressive stage (value "3") and veto (value "4"). Lastly and regarding the
					CONVERGENCE attribute, its greatest relevance would be attested the more it
					establishes closer ties with the party in Presidency or with whoever is
					occupying a ministerial office so as to better evaluate and verify party
					connection within <em>Appropriation</em>. Thus, there are no doubts that
					the values ​​"2" and "3" would reflect this scenario.</p>

								outcome </span></p>
</div>
				</p>
<p>Once the calibration stage is concluded, the software maps the combinations and
					stipulates for each of them their consistency level with the
						<em>Appropriation</em> categories. This mapping is accomplished
					through building a table of analysis or "truth table". The "truth table" is the
					central element of QCA, defining the subsets of conditions or analysis
					attributes. It contains the empirical evidence collected by the researcher,
					classifying cases in the possible combinations, i.e., across the lines of the
					truth table. Each one of these lines is connected to the result and is evaluated
					according to consistency parameters. <sup><a href="#B29">Ragin
						(2006)</a></sup> recommends that the consistency of each configuration shown in
					the truth table should be no lower than 0.75 and, if no problems are found with
					a scarce database, the frequency for each configuration should not be lower than
					3 cases. Once these parameters are identified we use Boolean algebra algorithms
					to identify regularities.</p>
<p>
					<p class="subsection-title">Reading of results</p>
				</p>
<p>The outputs generated by QCA are demarcated by logical expressions describing the
					combinations of the attributes considered to be sufficient, i.e., those that
					consistently respond positively to the desired result.</p>
<p>We must first explain that the software generates three alternative sets for the
					results. The first, called <em>Complex Solution</em>, offers a more
					detailed solution, which assumes that all configurations without corresponding
					empirical cases produced the absence of results of interest, preventing the
					simplification of sufficient configurations. The second, called
						<em>Parsimonius Solution</em> offers a simpler solution and assumes
					that all configurations with no cases directly related to the database
					(counterfactual) produce an outcome of interest, which allows for a maximum
					simplification of sufficient configurations. A third solution,
						<em>Intermediate</em> Solution, includes the solution of some
					counterfactual configurations that are consistent with outcomes of interest.</p>
<p>In the research I chose not take into account such configurations, given there
					are no problems concerning the "limited diversity", i.e., the low frequency of
					empirical data. In this case, Complex and Intermediate outputs are
					identical.</p>
<p>Once the offered solution is decided upon, we verify the configurations. Each
					configuration is accompanied by an analysis. First we have consistency, which
					indicates the degree of adjustment of the empirical data to the configuration of
					the results, or the percentage of scores generated by the configuration itself
					with a positive correlation with the outcome (in this case, with the category of
						<em>Appropriation</em>). Then we have the coverage or the percentage
					the outcome (category of <em>Appropriation</em>) which had a positive
					correspondence with the configuration. The coverage presents empirically
					relevant measures for the configurations considered to be consistent.</p>
<p>The first parameter, <em>raw coverage</em>, covers the entire response
					capability with the category of <em>Appropriation</em>. The second
					parameter, <em>Unique coverage</em>, measurers the "liquid" coverage, or
					the percentage of the result covered exclusively by the configuration, which
					makes sense when there is more than one configuration assigned as being a
					consistent result. Furthermore, the analysis provides two further pieces of
					information: <em>overall solution coverage</em> and <em>overall
						solution consistency</em>, corresponding to the applied results
					aggregating the set of configurations produced within the Boolean logic. As for
					consistency, the recommendation remains in the direction of only adopting levels
					above 0.75 (<sup><a href="#B29">RAGIN, 2006)</a></sup>. As for
					coverage, there is no minimum parameter to be observed.</p>
<p>Regarding the definition of "centrality" of the attributes found in each
					configuration found, the suggestion by <sup><a href="#B13">Fiss
						(2011)</a></sup> is to take the <em>parsimonius</em> and
						<em>intermediate solutions</em> to detect the <em>core</em>
					and <em>peripheral</em> attributes. <em>Core </em>attributes are
					those that are part of both solutions, while <em>peripheral</em>
					attributes are those not part of a <em>parsimonius solution</em>.</p>

					<sup><a href="#B1">Abranches (1988)</a></sup> reflected on the
					institutional dilemma marked by strong presidents and a fragmented party system,
					influenced by regional and private characteristics and lacking an ideological
					and programmatic identity. However, evidences have demonstrated the ability of
					the President to mobilize majorities via coalitions, ensuring the stability and
					success of mandates and converting coalition presidentialism as being
					practically synonymous with governability in Brazil. Although his researches
					have collaborated to emphasize the positive factors of this system <sup><a href="#B17">Limongi (2006)</a></sup> argues that the use of this
					expression would not be able to qualify Brazilian presidentialism as <em>sui
						generis</em> in comparison to other international experiences. The
					debate implies the existence of alternative viewpoints, including one arguing
					that the Brazilian system resembles European parliamentary democracies.</p>
</div>
<a name="fn2"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn2"></a><p><sup>2</sup><sup><a href="#B18">Limongi and Figueiredo (2009)</a></sup> show unease
					with approaches dealing with the characterization of Brazilian presidentialism.
					For the authors the system has parliamentary characteristics, that is to say,
					with the fusion of powers. This architecture would generate the routing of
					propositions in a coordinated manner and thus the fusion of agendas would take
					place.</p>
</div>
<a name="fn3"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn3"></a><p><sup>3</sup>Either way, in spite of controversies that still exist, this study intends to
					question the view of a Brazilian Presidentialism coalition that ensures the
					President's governability, based on the existence of an agenda power, the
					centralization of decisions by party leaders in Congress, the distribution of
					offices, and management of budgetary amendments.</p>
</div>
<a name="fn4"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn4"></a><p><sup>4</sup>This expression, created by <sup><a href="#B22">Mayhew (1974)</a></sup>,
					is commonly attributed to the strategies of parliamentarians to improve their
					reelection conditions. We opted to use it so as to indicate the possibility of
					securing a positive visibility and subsequently the implementation of the
					measure while also adding the notion of <em>position taking</em>, which
					in this research refers to public disclosure of the Executive's actions during
					the Presidency term.</p>
</div>
<a name="fn5"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn5"></a><p><sup>5</sup>This pertains to the case in which the former advisor to the President, Waldomiro
					Diniz, was accused of extortion, passive corruption and mismanagement.</p>
</div>
<a name="fn6"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn6"></a><p><sup>6</sup>When observing the American case, <sup><a href="#B6">Beckmann
						(2010)</a></sup> argues that the Executive is strongly constrained in the
					presentation of legislative propositions, which encourages actions from the
					Presidency during the agenda preparation stage, when leaders are mobilized and
					convinced of the importance of the issues at the same time in which ways to
					nullify or discourage the opposition's propositions are analyzed. In turn,
					strategies known as <em>end games</em> are centered on the ability to
					amass votes in plenary decisions.</p>
</div>
<a name="fn7"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn7"></a><p><sup>7</sup>In this case it is important to rely on the stage of the legislative process so
					that we may identify which party conducted the bill's handling and processing.
					In case of a frozen stage, the party considered was the same as the bill's
					writer. As for the "awaiting discussion" stage, if there was no writer we then
					evaluated whether party predominance was found. If that was not the case then we
					considered it to be zero convergence.</p>

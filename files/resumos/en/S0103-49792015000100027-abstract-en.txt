This article argues that the works of Guerreiro Ramos, in the 1950s, was developed based on a deliberate plan to create a post-colonial theory applied to Brazil. In this theory, the critical study of Brazilian social thought has a central role. In order to prove this hypothesis, I will reconstruct the intellectual path taken by Guerreiro during his work with IBESP, joining the logical reconstruction method with a historical-systematic method. I will ascertain the connections between his social theory and his critical texts on Brazilian sociological thinking.

Abstract: Protestants, although in general known by their modesty and prudery, do not cease to develop very specific regulations about sex. This article draws on the set of guidelines involving hetero and homosexuality. The analysis highlights how religion is an educational resource for the construction and reformation of the female body, not just monitoring it and controlling it, but producing a specific kind of sexuality. Data were gathered mainly from participant observation, held between 2011-2014, in Lagoinha Baptist Church, localized in Belo Horizonte. I attend and have notes on all of the events aimed at women and organized by Pastor Ana Paula Valad√£o.

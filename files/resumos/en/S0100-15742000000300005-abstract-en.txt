This study looks at the new modes of regulations for teaching that have been constructed in the context of the Argentine reform, affected by the changes in the world of work and the role of the State. In the conceptualization of teaching, there are various elements today that for a long time were considered to be antithetical to vocational traditions and feminine work are permeated by pressures deriving from the position of workers, who are facing threats to their employment and precarious job conditions. At the same time, based on the egalitarian traditions, they face resistance to the mechanisms of market competition and inclusion in the realm of public education. Thus there have been profound ruptures in the conceptualization of teaching which based in a republican ethic had meant a common project.

Abstract This article presents a reconstitution of the last cycle of political crisis in Bolivia (2000-2008), following mainly the action of three social organizations: the Confederación Sindical Única de Trabajadores Campesinos de Bolivia (CSUTCB), the Confederación de los Pueblos Indígenas de Bolivia (Cidob) and the Consejo de Ayllus y Markas del Qullasuyu (Conamaq). During the first critical years, the strong social mobilization shattered the borders of the institutional political field; later on, the political crisis changed as those who had been replaced in the control of national political power tried to disrupt the institutional power. After the political crisis was overcome, the boundaries of the field were restructured, excluding some of the indigenous persons who had acted on the construction of the new State.

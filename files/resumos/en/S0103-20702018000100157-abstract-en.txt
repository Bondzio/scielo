Abstract The article discusses problems of the manufacturing exporting model, established in Mexico, in the 1980&#8217;s, with emphasis on work relations and trade unions. The option for the manufacturing sector is because it has been presented as the engine of the economy, due to the exports, although the service sector has had a bigger participation in Mexican GDP. The intention is to analyse industrial segments that are the propellers of export, the strategy of low salaries and the dominant corporatist trade unionism in this economic configuration.

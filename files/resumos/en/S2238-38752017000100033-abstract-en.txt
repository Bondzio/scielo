Abstract The article discusses the sometimes acerbic, sometimes ironic, dialogue between the thought of Michel Foucault and the traditions of the social sciences and the humanities. As Foucault affirmed, thought is made to be cutting. Pursuing his itinerary of historical investigation, this requirement ended up disrupting our intellectual conventions, our research habits and our methodological toolbox filled with ready-made explanations of social realities. Hence his thought is provocative in kind. The aim here is to present a small inventory of these disruptions, pursuing various lines of inquiry and hypotheses that allow us to conclude with a reflection on the status of critique in the French philosopher's thought.

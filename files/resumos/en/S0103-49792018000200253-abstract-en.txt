In this essay, originally delivered as a conference, Enzo Traverso analyzes some of the strengths of Michael Löwy&#8217;s intellectual trajectory, from his early work son Marx, Lukacs, and Goldmann to his more recent reflection son Benjamin or on Romanticism. Applying to the author&#8217;s analysis the same method that he used to understand the authors he investigated, Traverso defends the hypothesis that, although born in Brazil, Löwy can be seen as a &#8220;French intellectual who combines and surpasses two traditions that marked deeply history, culture and politics of the twentieth century: that of Central European Judaism before Schoah and that of the Latin American left after the Cuban revolution.&#8221;

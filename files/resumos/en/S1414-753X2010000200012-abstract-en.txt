We focus on cross-sectoral policy coordination, based on the study of the relationships between deforestation in land settlement projects and rural environmental licensing. We identified technical and administrative failures, lack of integration and coordination in the implementation of the licensing policies. Efficient initiatives to reduce deforestation involve coordinated and integrated multidimensional actions across various political sectors.

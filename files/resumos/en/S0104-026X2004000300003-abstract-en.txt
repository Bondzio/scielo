This paper examines the present-day trends of feminist practices and theories. On what concerns political actions, it deals with the backlash trend, stressing the interests of neo-liberal progression. In the theoretical field it evaluates the impacts of feminist paradigms on women history and gender relation studies, giving special attention to the occultation of singularities of women history in Brazil and to the knowledge of the subject, the value of intellectual production and the bias of feminist movements. It suggests an effort of theoretical updating as a means of feminist militancy in the academic sphere. It proposes an agenda of researches in order to prepare accounts and registers of some themes that may improve certain concepts and update references of feminist struggles.

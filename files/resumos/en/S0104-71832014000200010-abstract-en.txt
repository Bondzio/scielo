After 150 years of coal mining and industrial production, the southern Chilean town of Lota entered during the 70's a twofold process of continuous symbolic and material decline. Under the guidance of trade-unions and the Comunist Party, which provided the ideological basis that shaped the miners striving, the city's population is renowned for its struggle against poverty and social injustice. The declining process, still underway after 40 years, has been taken over by adversity ever since the closure of the coal mines, namely: the military dictatorship that devastated the country during twenty years; the demise of most socialist regimes that sustained the miners quest for social justice; the enfeeblement of both the political parties and trade unions, among other events, have undermined social determination, forcing a redrafting of the relationship with both past and future. Through an ethnographic approach, based on interviews with former miners, women and local authorities, together with a thorough review of secondary sources, this article examines the productive, social, political, cultural and architectural transformations that speak for a town immersed in pain and longing for a redefined social utopia.

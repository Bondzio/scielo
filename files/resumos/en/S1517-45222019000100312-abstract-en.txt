Abstract In his latest book, La France des Belhoumi, the subject of this review, St√©phane Beaud portrays the members of a family of Algerian immigrants settled in France since the 1970s. The eight children of the couple had an upward social trajectory (passage of the popular class to the middle class) and it is this atypical course for families of Algerian immigrants in France that interests the sociologist. As in his previous works, Beaud is based on a qualitative sociological perspective and presents a detailed and stimulating work of interest for those who work with issues related to social mobility and the success of schoolchildren.

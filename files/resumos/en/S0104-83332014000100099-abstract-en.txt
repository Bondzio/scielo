We hereby bring a critical review based on 65 anthropological works carried out in Brazil and encompassing the themes of sexuality, sociability and market. We relate the investigations presented here to social processes and to processes from the broader field of anthropological studies. We have identified processes of change to empirical objects and analytical frameworks, both of which are mobilized by the aforementioned studies, which have been produced in the country since the 1960s. Finally, we point out how the studies of places of sociability - studies which recently have somehow started theming the consumer market - have been a very significant part of the Brazilian anthropological literature on sexuality, which has grown and diversified over the past two decades.

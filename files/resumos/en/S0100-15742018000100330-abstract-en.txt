ABSTRACT: Taking as a starting point the need to invest in the continuous improvement of the quality of Portuguese institutional environments for children in their early years, we present the results of a multiple case study, conducted in two day care centers with distinct characteristics. The objective was to understand the perspective of families and professionals about the quality of day care centers. The analysis of the data was based on the conceptual dimensions identified: organizational, environmental and relational. From these dimensions we identified gaps in the process of listening and interacting between professionals and families, considered fundamental for the dynamics of intersubjectivity that a shared construction of meaning on the quality of day care centers demands.

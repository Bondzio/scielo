Tropic&#225;lia, one of the most important artistic movements in the 1960&#8217;s, has been considered as radically opposed to some left wing views that strongly influenced cultural production in the period. This article argues that Tropic&#225;lia shared with the left the idea that the work of art must have as its subject Brazilian reality, while being at the same time associated with the struggles to bring about revolutionary changes in it; nevertheless, the movement created its own version of such a view. Tropic&#225;lia presented a more complex picture of Brazilian reality than the left wing&#8217;s, by pointing to the existence of a combination of &#8220;modern&#8221; and &#8220;archaic&#8221; elements where the left only saw the &#8220;archaic&#8221; ones. The left wing idea of Revolution was stretched to integrate revolution in individual behavior into broader social changes. Having deep seated roots in Brazilian reality, Tropicalismo was responsible for the creation of works which are still up to date in contemporary Brazil, such as &#8220;Gel&#233;ia Geral&#8221; by Gilberto Gil and &#8220;Tropic&#225;lia&#8221; by Caetano Veloso.

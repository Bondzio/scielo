AbstractThis article investigates the satisfactory evaluation of public policies in two cities in the suburban region of Porto Alegre, Brazil: Novo Hamburgo and Estância Velha. We developed a theoretical framework from the analytical perspective of social capital which takes into account the local value patterns (political culture) for the evaluation of public policies. The hypothesis is that public policies in a society detaining social capital have better conditions to succeed in their objectives. Thus, social capital becomes an ally to political institutions, having a positive impact on them. The results suggest that high levels of social capital are important variables that help improve the performance of public policies and of institutions providing services to the community. Data come from two surveys conducted in the cities of Novo Hamburgo and Estância Velha in 2012, with random samples totalizing 1.219 interviews.

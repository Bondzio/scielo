ABSTRACT How to generate well-being, peace and prosperity for a nation is an old and still fundamental question to almost the whole world. In this early 21st century, higher education has acquired a major relevance to the development of nations as it is directly related to educating both competent professionals and citizens with critical thinking. However, with economic purposes, governments are increasingly prioritizing the acquisition of practical training and skills. Considering this tendency, in this article, we seek to demonstrate by means of deduction that integral education and general knowledge in higher education can make a key contribution for nations to develop not only in terms of democracy and social inclusion, but also of economic growth itself.

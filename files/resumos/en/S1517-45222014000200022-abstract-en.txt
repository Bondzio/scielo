The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that Marcel Mauss, in his Essai sur le Don (The Gift), published in 1924, elaborates a sort of avant la lettre postcolonial thinking that structures his whole anti-utilitarian criticism of the Occidentalism and that may clarify some aspects of the decolonial criticism, particularly in its current relations with anti-utilitarian thinking developed in Europe.

This text analyzes two movements toward the internationalization of proposals for the teaching of mathematics. The first of them, in the early nineteenth century, was the setting-up, in 1908, of the International Committee on Mathematical Instruction; the second, in the mid-twentieth century, became known as the Modern Mathematics Movement. The analysis aims to show that the issue of internationalization points to the need for a historic-comparative approach as a way of producing mathematical education.

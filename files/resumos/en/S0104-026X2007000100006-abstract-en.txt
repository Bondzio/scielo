This paper presents an analysis of the power-knowledge relationship in the university context. Based on the exploration of the organizational structure of the University of Los Lagos in teaching and institutional management, the spaces of material and symbolic power that men and women occupy are identified. The results of an analysis of positions in the academic hierarchy, earnings and inclusion of the women in the teaching staff regarding both work hours and disciplinary distribution are presented. The investigation aims to reveal the factors that determine the distribution of the spaces of power in the University, establishing the relationships that underlie the acquisition of knowledge and the nature of the exercise of power.

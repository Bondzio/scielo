In recent years, the reduced presence of blacks in higher education has occupied an increasingly significant space in discussions of public policy agendas, social movement and academia. This work aims to study whether and how the observed changes in the profile of undergraduate students have changed in recent years. To this end, micro data of the Population Census 2000 and 2010 are used for the construction of the profile of students attending undergraduate school with a complementary analysis of their different training areas. The analysis indicates an improvement in the access rates to higher education for blacks, but with even distant results of their participation in the total Brazilian population. The paper presents the Racial Parity Index - RPI - as a synthetic indicator of the distance between blacks and whites in the different aspects presented.

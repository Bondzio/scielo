As a result of this   development, the most diversified social processes &#150; as well as the fields of   science which study them &#150; have had their dynamics altered. In International   Relations, this double challenge could be explained as follows: 1) in   empirical terms, climate change imposes a deepening of cooperation levels on   the international community, considering the global common character of the   atmosphere; and 2) to International Relations as a discipline, climate   change demands from the scientific community a conceptual review of the   categories designed to approach the development of global climate governance.   The goal of this article is to discuss in both conceptual and empirical terms   the structure of global climate change governance, through an exploratory   research, aiming at identifying the key elements that allow understanding its   dynamics. To do so, we rely on the concept of climate powers. This discussion   is grounded in the following framework: we now live in an international system   under conservative hegemony that is unable to properly respond to the problems   of interdependence, among which &#150; and mainly &#150;, the climate issue.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Keywords:</b> climate change; climate powers; global governance; the international system.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nos &uacute;ltimos cinco anos, a mudan&ccedil;a clim&aacute;tica tem se   estabelecido como um condutor central de nosso tempo. Como resultado desse   desenvolvimento, os mais diversificados processos sociais &#150; bem como os campos   cient&iacute;ficos que os estudam &#150; t&ecirc;m tido suas din&acirc;micas alteradas. Em Rela&ccedil;&otilde;es   Internacionais, esse duplo desafio pode ser explicado da seguinte maneira:   1) em termos emp&iacute;ricos, a mudan&ccedil;a clim&aacute;tica imp&otilde;e um aprofundamento nos   n&iacute;veis de coopera&ccedil;&atilde;o na comunidade internacional, considerando o car&aacute;ter comum   global da atmosfera; e 2) para as Rela&ccedil;&otilde;es Internacionais enquanto   disciplina, a mudan&ccedil;a clim&aacute;tica demanda da comunidade cientifica uma revis&atilde;o   conceitual das categorias concebidas para abordar o desenvolvimento da governan&ccedil;a   clim&aacute;tica global. O objetivo deste artigo &eacute; discutir em ambos termos emp&iacute;rico e   conceitual a estrutura da governan&ccedil;a em mudan&ccedil;a clim&aacute;tica global, por meio de   uma pesquisa explorat&oacute;ria, com o objetivo de identificar os elementos-chave que   permitam entender sua din&acirc;mica. Para isso, levamos em conta o conceito de   pot&ecirc;ncias clim&aacute;ticas. Esta discuss&atilde;o est&aacute; fundamentada sob o seguinte quadro:   n&oacute;s agora vivemos em um sistema internacional sob uma hegemonia conservadora   que &eacute; incapaz de responder adequadamente aos problemas da interdepend&ecirc;ncia,   dentre os quais &#150; e principalmente &#150;, a quest&atilde;o clim&aacute;tica. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Palavras-chave:</b> mudan&ccedil;a clim&aacute;tica; pot&ecirc;ncias clim&aacute;ticas; governan&ccedil;a global; o sistema   internacional.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last five years, a series of broad movements &#150;   in both physical and social terms &#150; has led to the consolidation of climate   change as a key civilizational driver<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> of our time. On the one hand, the   scientific community has gathered enough evidence to state that the phenomenon   of an anthropic destabilization of the climate system is a near-consensus idea   (IPCC 2007). On the other hand, the increasing number of extreme weather events   has contributed to consolidate the perception that we are no longer faced with a   theoretical speculation distant in time, but that there is an urgent and   tangible reality in front of our eyes (WMO 2011). Such consequences have   repeatedly been the subject of various researches in the most diverse fields of   human knowledge. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a consequence, many social processes &#150; and the   fields of science which study them &#150; have had their dynamics altered: Economy,   Politics<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a>, Security and Defense, etc. In   International Relations (IR), this double challenge could be explained as   follows: in empirical terms, climate change imposes a deepening of cooperation   levels on the international community, considering the global common character   of the atmosphere; as to IR as a discipline, climate change demands from the   scientific community a conceptual review of the categories designed to approach   the development of global climate governance, in a context of systemic change. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The framework related to this double challenge is the   migration of the climate issue to the core of international politics, which   means that the patterns of cooperation and conflict that define this very   sphere of social interaction will be more and more influenced by the   characteristics of the responses to the climate challenge. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The continuing key role of the climate crisis for human   future is related to the concept of planetary boundaries. In the natural   sciences community, it is more and more consensual that increasingly anthropic   pressure on the Earth system could lead to an abrupt change of global   environment (Rockstrom et al. 2009). Being the leading drivers of global   systemic change, human actions threaten to destabilize critical biophysical   systems, having detrimental or even catastrophic consequences to mankind's   well-being. For the last 10,000 years, Earth has been operating within the   stable domain of the Holocene, where certain biogeochemical and atmospheric   parameters have stayed within a relatively narrow range. However, since the   industrial revolution, our actions have been effectively pushing a series of   key processes of the Earth system out of the stable variation range. This shift   signals the transition from the Holocene to the Anthropocene, which comprehends   two processes: the anthropic factor as the leading driver of systemic climate   change, and the deviation &#150; which has profound potential consequences &#150; from   the stable patterns of the Holocene. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within this framework, the scientific community has   advanced in the identification of nine planetary boundaries within which   humankind could safely operate. Transgressing these boundaries implies entering   a risk zone of systemic environmental disruption. The notion of planetary   boundaries rises as a new way to deal with sustainability, not in an isolated   and localized form factor (sector analysis of growth limits and mitigation of   negative externalities) as in the traditional environmental approach, but in a   systemic, global fashion. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The nine planetary boundaries are: climate change,   ocean acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, nitrogen and phosphorus   cycles, freshwater use, change in land use, rate of biodiversity loss, chemical   pollution, and atmospheric aerosol loading. The first seven can be quantified,   and three out of the nine planetary boundaries have already been crossed:   climate change, rate of biodiversity loss and the nitrogen cycle. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal of this chapter is to discuss in both   conceptual and empirical terms the structure of global climate governance,   through an exploratory research, aiming at identifying the key elements that   allow understanding its dynamics. In this structure, a specific kind of agent   is prominent in shaping climate social outcome &#150; the climate powers. These great state actors are considered   leading agents in this specific area of governance, at the same time the formal   regime &#150; the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) &#150;   loses its relevance in driving the global transition towards a low-carbon   economy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The notion of major power that is used here entails   the capacity of societies, or in more specific terms, the convergence of the   state, the market and civil society. It is not restricted to the idea of state   power of the realist doctrine, described as a rational actor where internal   social and economic dynamics are not relevant. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This discussion is theoretically framed accordingly to   an international system under a conservative hegemony, which is open to change   and uncertain. Conservative here reflects the inaptitude of current structures   of global governance for responding to the problems of interdependence, among which   &#150; and mainly &#150; climate change.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to achieve these aims, this chapter is   divided into three parts. In the first section, the international system under   a conservative hegemony is described. In the second section, the structure of   climate governance is analyzed. In the last one, the role of super and great   climate powers as pivotal agents in this structure is also analyzed.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The international system under a conservative hegemony</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the middle of the last decade, several movements   in the international system converged to boost profound changes in its   characteristics. Thus, new actors and new topics exert more influence on the   outcomes of the field of IR. The migration of the climate crises to the core of   international politics, the consolidated position of emerging nations, and the   global economic crisis are probably the three most visible and transcendent   movements, but it is clear that these are not the only ones.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First of all, the migration of the climate issue to   the core of international politics is probably the most important systemic   movement of the last five years, because it brings up the fact that it is not   possible to maintain a sustainable civilizational path without a true reform of   global governance structures. Some evidence of this movement includes: UN   Security Council meeting to discuss climate change for the first time ever in   2007 and again in 2011; the creation of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and   Climate to facilitate draft agreements to the negotiations at the heart of the   UN; climate change as a recurring subject of G-20 and G-8 summits; massive   presence of world leaders during the Copenhagen Conference (COP 15) in 2009   including the intense media coverage of the summit, and climate security   becoming a key issue in the planning of the defense establishment of major   powers. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This migration to the center of the global agenda is   related to the fact that climate change has already transcended the typical   limits of international environmental problems, usually limited in reach, and   is progressively bound to the problem of defining a safe operating space for   humanity. To the extent that climate change can have serious consequences in   areas which are key to IR, this issue is no longer secondary and becomes part   of the main concerns from the international community. The first area, the   economy, has progressively been consolidated as a key element of climate   studies (Stern 2006). The second one concerns Defense and Security, since   climate issues have a growing importance among academics and policymakers (CNA   2007; Mabey 2008; EUA 2010).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A second major shift is the consolidation of power   redistribution in the international structure, as identified by Joseph Nye   (2011): from the West to the East, from state actors to non-state actors. In   the first case, the process has been synthesized by Fareed Zakaria (2008), who   coined the expression "the rise of the rest": non-traditional state actors come   into play vis-&agrave;-vis central states from the post-war period, resulting in an   increase of power to the former. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another example of this new geography of power is the   reproduction of groups of emerging countries with the goal of broadening their   presence and influence in the system. The most relevant of such groups is the   Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa group (BRICS). Inspired by a 2001   report from Goldman Sachs<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a>, the group started working in 2006 as a   discussion forum on great subjects related to global governance and became   formal in 2010. However, it is a loose group because of major differences among   the members. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The consolidation of the G-20 as a broad presidential   forum for global governance is another example of the growing importance of the   emerging countries in the system. Created in 1999, the forum reunited the 20   most important economies in the planet &#150; developed and emerging &#150; and accounts   for approximately 80% of world GDP, 80% of international trade, 80% of   greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and 70% of the world's population. During the   2008 economic crisis, G-20 lead the international community's efforts to avoid   a meltdown of the global economy, due to the lack of legitimacy of the G-7 and   the historical inefficiency of the UN General Assembly. Nonetheless, the   challenges that have risen from interdependence have largely surpassed the   group's abilities to govern the international system. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third significant change in the international   system is a shift in the conception of the world economy, due to the increase   in relative presence of the states to the detriment of the relative presence of   free markets. As a consequence, there is a growing consensus regarding the   concept of a mixed economy, in which the role of the state is both to regulate   and to promote incentives in order to expand some national productive sectors   (especially energy) and boost the power of specific economic agents. The   growing role of public expenditure in the aggregate demand is now a common part   of the landscape of global economies. This phenomenon is mainly explained by   the huge market failure that set off the 2008 crisis.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent changes in the international system have   another crucial driver: the drastic change in the terms of trade (TOT). The   rise in the price of commodities vis-&agrave;-vis industrial goods has been constant   during the last decade &#150; it started in 2003 and in opposition to what most   analysts argued, it survived the outburst of the 2008 crisis. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In spite of these important facts, many of the   characteristics of the pre-2007 international system still stand or, in some   cases, have strengthened, such as interdependence, globalization and the   expansion of democracy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are several diverging visions of these   transformations in the current literature of IR (Nye 2011; Ikemberry 2011;   Slaughter 2009; Zakharia 2008); however, we give preference to our own image of   the international order, which is synthetized in the concept of international   system under a conservative hegemony (Viola, Franchini and Lemos Ribeiro 2012).   The key idea is that the current structure of global governance is unable to   tackle the most pressing civilizational challenges of our time &#150; the climate   crisis and the economic crisis &#150;, which have been aggravated over the last five   years. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The criterion we use to qualify both the system and   the agents in terms of conservative/reformists<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> is the degree of   commitment to global governance and especially what we call 'climate   commitment'<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a>. Climate commitment is a key indicator   for global governance because the climate crisis demands a stronger cooperation   response when compared to other issues. Regarding international actors,   especially the great state powers, the more they commit to the construction of   collective mechanisms of climate and economic governance, the less the system   becomes conservative. However, empirical data show the challenges related to   the growing interdependence do not have compatible global governance   mechanisms. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The powerlessness that the UN had displayed during the   post-war becomes clamant in our era, which is increasingly transnational,   interdependent and characterized by a great acceleration of physical and social   processes. Experiences with restricted structures of governance in terms of   composition &#150; but universal in terms of agenda &#150; have been short on their   results, like the G-20. To sum up, major powers that have a defining role in   the international life are incapable and impotent in the conjuncture.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The notion of a conservative hegemony allows us to   stress the key argument of this article; the climate crisis becomes a key   civilizational driver and, as a consequence, it has a central role in defining   the patterns of behavior among members of the international system. Within this   framework, , the category climate commitment can be used to assess the   characteristics and trends in the international system; accordingly, it renders   it impossible to hold a positive view due to the inability of current global   governance structures to deal with this civilizational challenge. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This pessimistic vision of the international system is   not related to changes among the main agents of governance. The problem lies on   the very characteristics of the system: the climate and the economic crises   have pushed forward the need for efficient mechanisms of global governance.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The building up of an effective, efficient global   governance has as a necessary condition: the shifting from sovereignty to   post-sovereignty in most societies, and particularly in the most powerful ones.   This transformation requires moving from narrow national interest to a broader   national interest interconnected with universal interest (humanity and planet).   It also implies shifting from short-term to long-term approaches and interests.   Among the major powers, in real behavior, China, the US, India, Russia, and   Brazil are based in narrow national interests; South Korea and Japan have   internalized a small component of global interests in their mindset; while the   EU has incorporated more than the previous &#150; but still far away from being sufficient   &#150;, narrow European interest is still strong; also, sub-national (individual   countries) interest is strong.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two forms of sovereignty: in the most   radical, national state prevails over individual rights and over international   institutions (China, Russia), and they are authoritarian regimes. In the other   form, national state is limited by individual rights of citizens but it   considers itself above international institutions (USA, India, Brazil, Japan   and South Korea). In post-sovereignty, national state is restricted by   individual rights and surrenders part of its power to international   institutions. This is what the European Union promotes but has failed so far   because it does not have other partners.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to this conception of the international   order, the role of the great state actors &#150; major powers &#150; is essential to   define the characteristics of this system. The concept of major powers in times   of the climate crisis demands, in order to assess properly their level of   agency, the incorporation of two key variables: climate power and climate   commitment. Following these criteria, a network of conservative and moderate   conservative countries prevails in the system. Moderate countries act in   support of the conservative coalition when it comes to designing mechanisms of   global governance. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In spite of this, there are reformist forces operating   in the system, committed to a post-sovereignty type of global governance. These   agents challenge the conservative hegemony and can be found at any level (from   local to global) and sector (from public to private) of governance. These   forces are increasing their level of agency but at an insufficient pace, thus   not being consistent with systemic demands. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In sum, the governance problem becomes closely linked to   interdependence, more specifically; it is linked to the lack of institutions   compatible with the current level of interdependence. Global governance   structures cannot cope with the challenges that the growing influx of material   and symbolic resources imposes at the system level. In the end, the rhythm at   which social phenomena develops is largely faster than the ability of human   communities to react, at least in this first stage.</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Multilevel global governance</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The global governance structure can be divided into   areas so it can be better understood. These areas have their own logic, agents   and interaction dynamics that are particular. Climate governance has different   levels in its structure &#150; actors spread in a two-dimension scheme &#150; from local   to global, public to private. This architecture features a specific agent that   has the capacity to influence the climate social outcome in a decisive manner.   This agent is called climate power. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concept of climate powers comprehends a   combination of diverse dimensions of power. The first two dimensions have been   widely contemplated in IR tradition: military capacity and economic power. The   third dimension &#150; climate power &#150; is more innovative and closely related to the   climate issue, and also less discussed. Climate power resides in: volume and   trajectory of GHG in the atmosphere; human and technological capital to   generate a considerable impact on the transition to a low-carbon economy; and   the relation between resources and energy culture (Paterson 1996) &#150; also called   energy behavior. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is important to stress the strong level of   inter-relation among the economic, military and climatic dimensions &#150; each one   affects the content and evolution of the other dimensions. The concept of   climate power does not exclude non-material power factors, like influence and   prestige. In specific terms, the level of climate commitment can be a great   factor of ascendency over global climate dynamics. Based on these criteria, we   identify three categories of climate powers: </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Superpowers:</b> United States, China and the European Union. Altogether, they account for 55%   of world GDP and 47% of global carbon emissions. Superpowers share three   important characteristics: first of all, they all have a high proportion in   global GHG emission (at least 10%) and gross global product (at least 15%);   second of all, they have relevant human and technological capital for the   decarbonization of the economy; and lastly, they have the power to veto any   effective international global agreement. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Great   powers:</b> Brazil, South Korea, India, Japan and Russia. They account   for little less than 20% of world GDP and 20% of total emissions. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Middle   powers:</b> South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Argentina, Colombia,   Ukraine, Thailand, Venezuela, Malaysia, Philippines, Australia, Bangladesh,   Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Vietnam, Singapore,   Indonesia, Israel, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Taiwan and Turkey. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The last two categories have limited importance in   terms of global emissions share and participation in the world economy and,   while acting on their own, they lack the ability to veto a global international   agreement. However, their behavior affects climate governance, since they can   tamper with or boost the trajectory of global decarbonization. This last   feature is especially decisive when considering great powers: an occasional   great powers alliance could deeply change global climate politics. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In terms of climate<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a> commitment we classify   the leading state actors of global climate governance as follows: </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conservative:</b> India, Russia, Argentina, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran,   Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand, Ukraine, Venezuela and Vietnam. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Moderate   conservative:</b> USA, China, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, South Africa,   Malaysia, Mexico, Turkey, Israel, Australia, Bangladesh and Philippines. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Reformist:</b> Norway, Taiwan, Switzerland, Singapore, the European Union, South Korea and   Japan.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Major climate powers in the transition to a low-carbon   economy</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this section we analyze the role of each super and   great power in the global governance of climate change, both in terms of   climate power and climate commitment.

US has a   population of over 313 million, a US$ 15,1 trillion GDP and a US$ 48,000   per capita GDP. The US emits, annually, 7.8 tons of carbon dioxide   equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) &#150; 15% of world emissions, 25 tons per capita   figures and 0.5 ton for US$ 1,000 in GDP. The US is a moderate   conservative in terms of the low-carbon economy transition and its vulnerability   to climate change is medium.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The American economy operates under a relative high   energy efficiency and low carbon intensity when compared to global standards,   but it features one of the highest carbon intensity among developed countries   due to its oil- and coal-based mixed energy matrix and large use of airplanes   and individual cars as transportation. US emission rose 0.8% from 2001 to 2008,   and after 2008 they have been stagnated as a result of the economic crisis and   will probably remain as they are, a positive outcome of the increase in oil   prices. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The American government became extremely reckless   during the Bush Administration (2001&#150;2008), after leading the negotiations on   the Kyoto Protocol alongside the European Union during the Clinton Administration   (1993&#150;2000). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first four months of the Obama Administration   signaled that the new government would tackle both the economic and climate   crisis at once, boosting the decarbonization of the economy, as it considered   that the two crises were associated. At the beginning of his term, a proposal   of caps and trade was submitted to Congress, deepening and providing national   reach to legislation already in force in California and New England (Speth   2010). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, this process lost momentum. The Waxman   climate and energy bill, which imposes caps and quotas for carbon emission, was   passed by the House in June 2009 and remained stuck in Senate during the second   semester due to the Obama Administration healthcare reform priority over other   proposals. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several factors account for this failure: extreme   bipartisan polarization in Congress resulted in legislative paralysis and   crisis of governability; high unemployment rates eroded Obama's approval   ratings; the extreme cold winter of 2010 in the East Coast, demagogically used   by the Republican Party as an example of the excesses in the assessments of   global warming threat; strong lobbying by oil, coal, steel, cement and   electricity industries against the climate bill arguing that it would make the   American industry less competitive.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Strong opposition to emissions reduction commitments   is observed in Congress; they mostly arise from the lack of formal commitment   from great emerging countries, particularly China. In addition, since 2009 the   issue of climate change has progressively become an issue of partisan cleavage   between democrats and republicans, similar to abortion and guns control.   (Rothental 2011). This fact makes it harder to debate based on scientific facts   (or even common sense) and, thus, the possibility of a bipartisan agreement is   drastically low. Should this cleavage consolidate itself as an element of   American internal politics, the prospects of decarbonization of the US economy   &#150; as well as of the global economy &#150; will be compromised.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problems of governability of the American   democracy express, to some extent, the strong division in this society: one   part is open and sensitive to globalization and the other is more closed and   fundamentalist, and resorts to a semi-isolationist ideology. It is also   observed as a deeper movement, the progressive erosion of the basic American   values, steaming from the weak and uncertain economic recovery, the constant   (un)employment crisis, the increase of social inequality and the growing   stagnation of social mobility &#150; possibly the most powerful driving force of   American culture. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dynamics of traditional (conservative) forces   versus decarbonizing (reformist) forces in the United States can be described   as: in the private sector, middle-size oil companies, thermoelectric utilities,   and the car industry (with the exception of Ford, even if the company's   efficiency level is not the same as the level of Japanese car makers) are   conservative. Reformist forces are the solar, wind and nuclear energy sectors;   information and technology industries like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle and   CNN; biotechnology, engine and capital goods, like General Electric; and the   big retail chains, like Wal-Mart and green construction suppliers, among   others. The bioenergy sector holds an intermediate position, to the extent that   it represents an option in renewable energy, but it is produced from corn &#150;   inefficient when compared to other crops.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In politics and society, New England, New York,   Maryland, California, Oregon, Washington and Illinois are considered reformist   forces; especially New England and California, which already have climate   legislation. The conservative forces predominate among most of the other   states. The largest civil society organizations committed to climate governance   are based in the United States, as well as the largest scientist community of   climate research anywhere in the world; the most climate skeptical think tanks   are also based in the US, with a high level of impact on national politics. As   to the media, most national broadcast companies accept the scientific consensus   regarding the climate issue (New York Times, CNN, Washington Post), but the Fox   network and the local media are very conservative. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The United States have a good potential of emissions   reduction through technological change from thermoelectric utilities to "clean   coal" (cleaner technologies) and carbon capture and storage (CCS); expansion of   wind, solar, and nuclear energy and biofuel; reduction in size and increase in   car efficiency; upgrading of electrical power grid; and the establishment of   new green standards of construction &#150; buildings and houses designed or   remodeled to reduce emissions (Sachs 2009).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the beginning of Obama's term, there was an   expectation in Europe that the US would advocate a role of co-leadership   alongside the EU in global climate politics. This expectation was closer to   become a reality in May 2009, but, when the Waxman Climate and Energy Bill was   eventually passed by the House in June 2009, the prospects were less favorable,   due to the fact that the commitment of reducing emissions was set to only 3%   (base-year 1990), distant from the 20% proposed by the European Union and   insignificant when compared to the 30&#150;40% demanded by the IPCC. Finally, as   argued before, the project was abandoned     in 2010. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the attempts from the Democrat Administration   to increase its climate commitment<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a>, the US position on climate change has   been conservative in the last decade. The official discourse of the American   diplomacy is skeptical of the urgency in signing a legally-binding document in   the realm of the UNFCCC and insists on the need of all great climate actors   being included in the efforts of mitigation.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The European Union is formed by 27 countries and has a   population of around 500 million people, a GDP of   US$ 15.8 trillion and a per capita GDP of US$ 31,500, and emits   5.7 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e &#150; 11% of global emissions &#150; and a   11 ton per capita figures and 0,36 ton of carbon for US$ 1,000   of GDP. Generally speaking, its vulnerability to the effects of climate change   is medium and has a strong potential in terms of low-carbon technology.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The EU is heterogeneous, both in terms of per capita   emission and carbon intensity: low in Nordic countries, Germany, the UK and   France; medium in Spain, Belgium and Italy; and high in Poland, the Czech   Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, and in Baltic countries. EU's emission increase at   a 0.5% annual rate, as a result of stable emissions figures from Germany, the   UK and Sweden, and the fast increase of emissions from Spain, Portugal, Greece   and Eastern Europe countries &#150; the latter countries are still below their 1990   baseline. However, just like in the United States, the economic crisis affected   deeply the trajectory of emissions between 2008 and 2011, and in this   particular case, lowering emission levels below 2007 figures.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main political leaderships of the EU in the last   few years have been in favor of an incisive action to mitigate global warming,   despite the different degrees of climate commitment among its members, which   also expresses the heterogeneity of the bloc. The governments and public opinion   of the UK, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark altogether with   France, Belgium, Finland and Ireland &#150; albeit the latter ones having a lower   profile &#150; are the most reformists. Of all EU's big members, Germany and the   United Kingdom are leaders; the former has a historical commitment to   sustainability, which can be noticed in the political relevance of the   environmental movement and the Green Party, and the early Industrial Recycling   Bill of 1991. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding the UK, in the last few years, the British   government has had the most advanced position among EU countries, as it passed   in Parliament a law that established a carbon budget, in November 2008, and the   releasing of The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan, in July 2009. With this   program, the UK has committed itself to reducing emissions in 34% by 2020,   considering 1990 as the base-year (British Government 2009). The liberal   presence in the new coalition government, which started in June 2010, has   granted the continuity of this policy, even if at a slow pace due to the   severity of the economic crisis. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In terms of international positions, the UK government   &#150; under the Blair and Brown Administrations &#150; was more proactive than their   German counterparts, even if Germans are more advanced in the transition to a   low-carbon economy. Yet, the decarbonization of the German economy is happening   keeping a large industrial sector, whereas the British decarbonization takes   places under severe decline of manufacturing. Among other big EU countries,   France is a responsible actor regarding the climate, with low per capita   emissions and an energy matrix based on nuclear power. The country, however, is   less responsible than its British and German partners and will probably not   meet the goals of the Kyoto Protocol; Italy, on the other hand, lacks a serious   climate policy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding other important countries of the bloc,   Denmark has been on its way to becoming independent from oil for some time, led   by conservative governments little committed internationally to the climate   crisis until 2007. From this year on, the foreign climate profile of the Danish   government has increased after the victory of a coalition headed by the Social   Democrats. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Poland's economy features high per capita emissions figures,   originated from a heavily coal-based energy matrix and low responsiveness from   the public opinion regarding climate change. These elements put the Polish   government along with the Italian one in the conservative coalition in the   realm of the EU. Until 2007, Spain had also had a negligent position, but in   that year, it admitted that their growing emissions during the last decades   were an issue.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 2008 economic crisis and the consequent   instability in the Eurozone eroded the European ability to lead a transition   towards a low-carbon economy, yet Europe is still the only reformist   superpower. Considering that, the degree of agency of the bloc in the   architecture of climate governance progressively withers. The EU only led the   climate governance process between 1996 and 1998, alongside the American   administration. After this period, the bloc was unable to guide the process,   albeit some attempts. However, an occasional failure of the European project   would be a huge setback in the prospects of humanity creating more efficient global   governance mechanisms, since it is the first and only post-sovereignty   large-scale experiment ever tried.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In current international negotiations, the EU   radicalizes its position on the American conservative behavior and tries to   isolate them from the West. However, its attitude towards China is less stiff,   because the EU does not demand so hard from the Chinese, as they do from the   Americans, their commitment to a legally-binding mitigation agreement.   Consequently, the EU does not give enough importance to a key issue in shaping   global climate governance: the growing role of the great emerging countries. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">China has a population of 1.35 billion people, a   US$ 11.3 trillion GDP and a US$ 8,400 per capita GDP, emits   10.9 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e a year &#150; 21% of global emissions,   8 tons per capita and 0.96 tons of carbon for every US$ 1,000 of   GDP. Among the superpowers, China is the only one that has a high level of   vulnerability to the effects of climate change, while some of its areas face   extreme risks. It is a very carbon-intensive economy, due to its heavily coal-   and oil-based energy matrix and, notably, its low energy efficiency.   Contradicting the common sense approach, China's per capita emissions are   medium, not low. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The costs of reducing emissions in China will be high,   should the current model of industrialization be maintained, but a shift   towards a model in which the internal market and an increase in productivity   replace the export-led growth model is viable. The regime, however, is afraid   of making this transition and remains in a conservative position, not being   able to anticipate the problems and being reactive instead. In such terms, the   Chinese political system shares the same dysfunctions of the great democracies.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The position of the Chinese government &#150; in both   energy and climate policies, as well as in international negotiations &#150; had   been negligent until 2006, when it started to change based on the country's   vulnerabilities assessment of climate change; that is why the country operates   as a moderate conservative agent in the climate global governance structure.   The government has pushed the development of wind and solar power and announced   the goal of reducing their emissions growth rate. This goal was put forth in   China's National Climate Change Programme and in the anti-crisis stimulus   package passed in November 2008, which had a 35% share of public expenditure on   the transition to a low-carbon economy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The government's effort to improve the energy profile   of the economy includes the extension of the nuclear power plants network &#150; the   number of planned nuclear power plants surpasses the number of facilities   combined worldwide &#150; and the building of hydroelectric power plants, China   being one of the economies that uses this source of energy the most. According   to McKinsey &amp; Company (apud The Economist 2012), a consulting firm, this   official attempt to progressively abandon the dependency on coal is not that   simple: the fractured structure of the local mining business, the abundance of   this mineral in both China and countries capable and willing to export it to   the Chinese market &#150; Australia, Indonesia and Mongolia &#150; conspire against the   official plans of demand reduction. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding the Chinese position in international   negotiations, it was lagging behind when compared to their new energy policy.   Addressing the UN General Assembly, in September 2009, President Hu Jintao   announced that the country was willing to take responsibility in the fight   against global warming and signaled the goal of reducing China's carbon   intensity in its GDP at a yearly rate of 4&#150;5%, between the years of 2005&#150;2020.   Nonetheless, China is still reluctant to commit to a peak of emissions and to a   stabilization year prior to 2020 &#150; as claimed by the international scientific   community, the EU, the United States and Japan. This fact increases the   ammunition of conservative groups in the American Congress.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As to technology, there has been great advance in both   efficiency and productivity from Taiwanese photovoltaic solar energy companies,   since 2009, and the formation of joint ventures for massive investment in China   in a large program called "low-carbon cities." After 2009, it is safe to say   that there are two Chinas carbon-wise: on the one hand, a predominant   traditional China, a powerhouse and exporter of carbon emissions; on the other   hand, a new low-carbon China, still small, but which grows at a fast rate due   to a very high savings and investment capacity of the country that will create   a generation of new low-carbon entrepreneurs whose interests are contrary to   the ones from traditional China. Thus, China is a conservative power for its   history until 2008, but shows strong signs of low-carbon trends due to green   investments from that time on. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reformist Chinese elite is located in high   development poles, especially Shanghai, and in sectors of solar, wind and   nuclear energy. In parallel, the conscience over the climate threat is bigger   in the coast than it is in mainland. There are several elements that combined   can explain the growth of reformist forces in Authoritarian China. First of   all, three important drivers of decarbonization: a) a strong perception of   the vulnerabilities to climate change in society; b) the need to maximize   the competitiveness of the new economy; and c) the attempt to add soft   power to the country. Second of all, the dynamics of the Communist Party, which   in the last two decades has prioritized the technical skills and scientific   background of its members over political ideology. Restoration of Confucian   cultural heritage plays an important role in favor of climate sensitiveness. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2012, globalist forces continued to gain ground in   their movement to command the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and determine   Chinese politics as a consequence, against nationalist forces. The biggest   evidence of this process is the fall of the powerful governor of the Chongqing   province (33 million inhabitants), Bo Xilai, who for many years had been a   prominent figure in the CCP. After charges of corruption and a quick move from   CCP leaders, Bo Xilai was removed from party posts, losing any chance of   influence in the ongoing political transition. Bo's removal is a positive sign   of certain political and economic structural reforms: changes in the   development model, shifting from exports to domestic expending and consumption   and less exchange rate manipulation over the Yuan; some degree of political   liberalization; awareness of environmental issues as a result of growing   popular complaints and dissatisfaction with the degradation of the environment<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a>.   Considering that these movements are convergent with the position and interests   from the core of democracies, should they become successful, these movements   may help building systemic governance, in terms of global governance and   climate governance.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Great powers</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">India has a population of 1.2 billion people, a   US$ 4.5 trillion GDP and a per capita GDP of US$ 3,700. It emits, annually,   3.6 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e &#150; corresponding to 7% of world   emissions, 3 tons of carbon per capita and 0.8 tons for every   US$ 1,000 of GDP. It features a low per capita emissions rate and high   carbon intensity due to low energy efficiency and elevated presence of coal and   oil in the energy matrix. Approximately 70% of the country's electricity has   coal as its source, and considering that over 300 million Indians have no   access to electricity, it is reasonable to expect that there will be a strong   expansion of the demand over the next few years (The Economist 2012). In this   context, coal is a natural option, to the extent that India is the world's   third largest supplier and the fifth in reserves. At the same time, the   anticipated demand of energy can make India the leading importer of coal in the   following years.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This increase in demand is also backing the   development of clean alternative options, such as solar photovoltaic and wind   energy, faster than Brazil, but slower than China. India has been partly   developing ethanol, since it is the world's largest sugar supplier, even though   most of its production is for human consumption. The country features medium   potential in terms of capital for the low-carbon transition and, in terms of   vulnerability, is extremely exposed to the effects of climate change, a unique   case among great powers. India is a conservative great power. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">India's emissions grow at a 6% yearly rate. According   to a report from Mckinsey (apud The Economist 2012), they will be   2.5 times higher in the year 2030, resulting in the approximate figure of   India accounting for 10% of the increment in global emissions. The position of   the Indian government has been historically negligent, just like the Chinese   counterparts, and has not changed yet. Some academic and government sectors in   India have elaborated a conspiracy theory based on historical grudge against   the West, particularly against the British, entitled Carbon Colonialism,   according to which the proposals of carbon mitigation in developing countries   are a way of maintaining the status quo of underdevelopment. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The voluntary commitment of the country presented at   international forums is to reduce its carbon intensity of GDP in 20&#150;25% by 2020   when compared to the levels of 2005, but excluding the agricultural sector.   Indian authorities justify their conservative position arguing that India   features a low level of per capita emissions and that there is a development   imperative, which demands that 470 million people be taken out of poverty   (IISD 2011). The negative side to the low per capita emissions figures is the   high fertility rate (2.8 children per woman). In terms of birth rate,   India is the most non-responsible among the BASIC countries, along with South   Africa (2.7 children), in contrast with China (1.3 children) and   Brazil (1.9 children), both below replacement rates (The Economist 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">India is a democratic regime &#150; albeit being a   low-quality democracy due to the heritage of the caste system &#150; and has an   important environmental movement, which contests, with a certain degree of   ambivalence, the official position. The Indian government is very fragmented   and inefficient, which makes it even harder for a transition towards a   less-carbon economy to take place. Approximately 18 Ministries work on   climate change subjects and there is no clear leadership from none. The   combination of an inefficient political regime, with extreme regional   inequality and a very particular perception of natural catastrophes conspire   against a better form of governance of the climate issue in India. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Russia has a population of 142 million people, a   US$ 2.4 trillion GDP and a US$ 16,700 per capita GDP.

It features a medium vulnerability to the effects of climate change and   has small capital for the low-carbon transition, a single case among great and   superpowers. It is a society that has enriched greatly in the last decade, but   has low energy efficiency and an energy matrix heavily based on fossil fuel,   being a large exporter of oil and gas.

Japan is the economy with the lower   carbon intensity worldwide, due to its enormous energy efficiency and the   preponderant role of nuclear energy in their power supply. The country is   highly vulnerable to the negative effects of climate and a very high potential   in terms of low-carbon capital; however, this potential is restrained by the   unwillingness of society and the government to lead this transition at the   world level.

Japanese society   seems to have internalized the last two decades of economic recession in a   unique way, progressively becoming a post-growth society, in which the reality   of stagnation does not bring significant trouble for life in community. Despite   this, Japanese society is still closed, extremely hierarchical and aging, which   makes it less sensitive to the influxes of globalization and places   considerable limitations for it to become a paradigm in terms of global   dynamism, as it had been in the 1970s, when the reforms carried out after the   first oil crisis (1973) placed the country on the cutting edge of energy   efficiency and technology.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Japan's leadership role in international affairs lags   behind its potential due to Japan's low-profile foreign policy and, more   recently, to negative effects on the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear   disaster. Despite the fact that the definite effects of the plant's explosion   are still unclear, it is possible to say that there were carbonizing   consequences &#150; as well as effects on the balance of payments &#150; for the Japanese   economy, as a result of the temporary shutdown of most of the reactors. In the   long run, the commitment of Japan with the development and use of non-fossil   technologies is complex. On the one hand, Fukushima was absorbed by elites as   an external event; thus, the accident had little impact on the legitimacy of   the nuclear option. On the other hand, the impact on society in terms of   insecurity was larger, which strengthened the anti-nuclear alliance, with an   uncertain impact on politics. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">South Korea is a reformist great power that has a   population of 49 million people, a US$ 1.5 trillion GDP and a   per capita GDP   of approximately US$ 31,000, emits annually 676 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e   &#150; representing 1.3% of global emissions, and 14 tons per capita and   0.43 tons of carbon per US$ 1,000. South Korean society has a high   level of exposure to effects of climate change and is important because the   country has a very large capital of human and technological resources to lead   the low-carbon economy transition. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last few years, South Korea has kept a profile   that places the country on the forefront of the low-carbon economy transition,   which includes a goal of emissions reduction of 30% by 2020 from the business as   usual (BAU) emissions scenario (IISD 2011). Due to this fact and because it   operates close to the technological frontier, the country deserves this place   among the great climate powers, even if their share of global emission is not   that significant. The Korean program is an ambitious bet that combines capacity   for innovation, technological capital and human capital. The Korean elites were   the most skillful and were able to manage the financial and climate crisis,   earmarking 80% of their fiscal rescue package for clean policies. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, it is important to recall that the Korean   economy is highly competitive &#150; based on the coexistence of big enterprises and   the State &#150; and in which the decision making process offers a dialogue channel   between corporate boards and political offices, making the mechanism of policy   implementation more efficient. By doing so, the transition to a low-carbon   economy takes places under heavy     state interventionism &#150; in the sense that corporations and the government work   together &#150;, when compared to what happens in Frances, Germany or the United   Kingdom.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brazil has a population of 195 million people, a   2.3 trillion GDP and a per capita GDP of US$ 11,800.

In the last five   years, Brazil transitioned from the conservative side to the moderate   conservative field in global climate governance. This transition had three main   pillars: a) drastic reduction in deforestation rates between 2005 and 2011   (Viola and Franchini 2012); b) a voluntary commitment to reduce emission   trajectory in November 2009; and c) the sanctioning of a Climate Bill   (Brazilian Law no. 12,187) at the beginning of 2010.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, after this positive impulse between 2009 and   2010, the climate and environmental agenda has suffered considerable setbacks,   like the expansion of the oil sector, the reform of Brazilian Forest Code,   increase in gasoline consumption, the stagnation of ethanol, and the persistent   expansion of individual/private transport. Policies at the federal level have   abandoned the focus on issues of low carbon, in particular, and environmental,   in general: not only has the implementation of the Climate Law barely advanced,   but, in early 2012, the government also responded to the international crisis   with a traditional carbon-intensive industrial stimulus package, focused on the   car manufacturing sector and decided to eliminate taxation on oil consumption   on the same day as Rio+20 ended, in June 2012.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two main drivers shape global climate governance:   climate power and climate commitment. Climate power refers to the level of   influence of certain agents over the climate social outcome at systemic level.   Climate commitment analyses how the logic of governance in this field is   defined by the interaction among forces that understand the climate problem as   a civilizational crisis &#150; reformist &#150; and forces that resist the profound   transformations necessary to stabilize the climate system &#150; conservative. In   this dynamics, the conservative forces are predominant and this accounts for   the reason why the international system is defined in this article as one under   a conservative hegemony: the system's evident incapacity to develop an adequate   response to the major challenges of our time, such as global financial crises,   climate change, and planet boundaries, which are deeply-demanding problems,   requiring considerable governance capacity. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The structure of climate governance is extremely   complex and comprehends diverse dimensions &#150; economic, environmental and   security &#150; and several actors &#150; public and private, local and global. Yet,   there is a type of agent &#150; a state actor &#150; whose concentrated capacities can   exert high influence on climate social outcome: climate powers. At times when   focusing on the formal climate regime &#150; UNFCCC &#150; results in fruitless attempts   to evaluate the future of global politics in this field, it is convenient to   adopt an approach based on the behavior of these specific state actors. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As discussed before, the majority of super and great   powers are not reformist &#150; the US, China, India, Brazil and Russia &#150;, and those   who are &#150; the EU, South Korea and Japan &#150; lack the agency necessary to   stimulate global behavior more favorable to the stability of the climate   system. The fact that the US and China are moderate conservative is central to   our analysis: American society is divided, and it hinders any pro-global   governance policy; China is at a slow pace and taking an uncertain road to low   carbon. The only superpower committed to climate governance &#150; the EU &#150; is going   through a process of economic and political crisis that compromises its ability   to lead global decarbonization. This is the main reason for which the   international system is blocked when it comes to this issue, and this is why it   is described as conservative. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The year of 2009 changed profoundly the international   political economy of climate change. The combination of the political failure   of Copenhagen and the suspicions regarding climate science after the so-called <i>climategate</i> (Prins   et al. 2010)   spread feelings of cynicism, on one side, and skepticism, on the other.     The heritage of the Kyoto Protocol, which left the United States and the great   emerging countries out of carbon constraints, has been dismantled (Ladislaw   2010). Evidence suggests that the Kyoto Protocol is ceasing to exist as an   emissions reduction mechanism in 2012, placing more uncertainty over capacity   of the UN system to respond properly to the climate problem. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new treaty &#150; comprehensive and legally binding &#150; is   virtually impossible unless the United States passes a climate bill that   imposes quantified emissions reduction. Due to the current political dynamics,   this is unlikely to happen.     The most optimistic scenario (2013&#150;2014) includes the reelection of President   Obama in November 2012, victory of Democrats in the House of Representatives   and in the Senate and the decision of reelected President Obama to prioritize   the climate bill at the beginning of his second term. The shale gas revolution   from 2011 to 2012 &#150; which promises to deepen in the near future &#150; will likely   have mixed and uncertain impact in the readability of the American society to   decarbonization. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The economic and security dimensions of the   international system have a key impact on the climate dimension and it is   necessary to promptly take them into account in any credible analysis of the   future of climate governance. The global economic crisis that started in 2008   has given the climate problem a lower priority &#150; one consequence of the crisis   &#150; when compared to demands of economic recovery, as observed in the American   midterm elections of 2010. Most mainstream economists and opinion formers   continue separating the climate crisis from the economic crisis. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If this trend of cooperation and continuing   depolarization persists in the international system in the following years, and   Obama is reelected in 2012, the United States will be more susceptible to a   change in its position &#150; from a moderate conservative superpower to a reformist   one. It is not likely but it is possible to think a future scenario in which an   alliance among the EU, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and the United States could   persuade/constrain China, Russia and India to set their emissions peaks and   different stabilization years inside the range set by scientific predictions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bibliographic references</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CNA. <i>National Security and   the Threat of Climate Change</i>. 2007.

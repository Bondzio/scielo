ABSTRACT The first section of the article discusses the need to think about teacher training as professional education. For this, it is fundamental to build a new institutional place, so that the profession occupy its place within the training institutions. Between the two sections, it is argued that training should consolidate the position of each person as a professional as well as the position of the profession itself. In the second section, the need to reorganize the place of teacher education is discussed, unfolding the concept of position in five movements: personal disposition, professional interposition, pedagogical composition, research recomposition and public exposition. The text concludes with a coda, which stresses the importance of the profession to the education of teachers and of teacher education to the profession.

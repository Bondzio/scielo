In the dinamicy of intertextuality, in rhizomatic writing, I have woven three films - The oyster and the wind, The breast and the moon, The Sacred Mound - that depict children's different personal experiences of the discovery of sexuality and of gender relations. This is part of a larger project entitled "Weaving gender and sexual diversity in a protection network", funded by Secad/MEC in 2007. This text is part of the subproject "The rights of the child". Many children who are protagonists of this play have made it possible to write this script. The text argues that the adult often applies the violent power of his/her look onto the child's desire - which can dodge such power - building an escape. But it also acknowledges that the adult can, intentionally, enable a child to saturate him/herself in the subject of sexuality and gender.

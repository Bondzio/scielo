A notable exception exists in Brazil, however, where small    retailers have held their place in the market and recently even gained ground.    The literature investigating how retail concentration has affected agrifood    chains has focused activities of the largest retail chains, implicitly holding    the scale, scope and specialization of retailers input needs constant, and    overlooking the influence of these factors on retailers procurement strategies.    This paper tests hypotheses regarding these variables effects on retailers    fresh produce procurement strategies. Data is drawn from a survey of retailers    in metropolitan S&atilde;o Paulo. The research results provide insight into    factors underlying retailers procurement strategy choices and tradeoffs among    options. The results support the fundamental hypothesis of the paper that research    on the competitive strategies of smaller retailers in a context of market domination    by large retailers should not focus exclusively on the degree to which the smaller    retailers imitate the larger retailers rather it should account for the possibility    that the underlying characteristics of the retailers may make diverse competitive    strategies appropriate. </font> </p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Keywords:</b> scale, scope, specialization,    procurement strategy, fresh produce, retail    <br>   <b>JEL Classification:</b> L22 </font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ao redor do globo, a emerg&ecirc;ncia de grandes    cadeias de supermercado em mercados aliment&iacute;cios de varejo &eacute; frequentemente    associada &agrave; marginaliza&ccedil;&atilde;o de varejistas menores.

Introduction</b></font> </p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brazilian agri-food markets, reflecting worldwide    trends, have seen the emergence of large chains of supermarkets and hypermarkets    as dominant players. The competitive strategies of these large chains have wrought    major changes in the structure and performance of agrifood markets, not only    at the retail level but also along the marketing chain to the farm level. Although    the rise of large, modern supermarket and hypermarket chains is associated with    the marginalization of many small and more traditional retailers in many countries    markets (for example see Arnole &amp; Luthra 2000; Reardon &amp; Berdegue 2002),    a notable exception exists in Brazil, where small chains and independent supermarkets    of diverse formats have managed to not only persist in the market, but also    gain ground relative to the large chains (Farina, Nunes et al. 2004). Currently    two categories of food retailers can be generalized as existing in Brazillarge    modern supermarket and hypermarket chains and smaller, more traditional retail    formats (such as open-air fairs, independent supermarkets, and green grocers).    These different types of retailers compete through their merchandising and procurement    strategies, however only limited research exists about how differences in their    merchandising and procurement strategies contribute to the coexistence of diverse    retailers. This research investigates the determinants of retailers procurement    strategies, complementing existing work on Brazilian retailers merchandising    strategies (for an example, Farina et al 2004).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Literature on the rise of large chains has focused    on how their competitive strategies have affected upstream market structure    and performance, particularly through their shifts in procurement strategies    (Loseby, 1997; Green, 2000; Farina, 2002). By focusing almost exclusively on    large chains and their strategies, the literature has implicitly held the scope,    scale, and specialization of retailers input needs constant, thus overlooking    the influence of these factors on retailers procurement strategies. Meanwhile,    research considering the role of smaller retailers (both supermarket and non-supermarket    formats) has often sought to document the extent to which they have emulated    large chains strategies (e.g. Shaw, 1999) but not explicitly modeled how the    underlying characteristics of these firms, including scope, scale, and specialization,    affect the strategies that they do use. The implicit assumption in these works    is that a dominant strategy will emerge and that those who cannot or do not    adopt that strategy will struggle to compete. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This paper examines the effects of scope, scale,    and specialization on procurement strategies, taking the stance that these variables    influence the firms procurement strategies and, therefore, the firms competitiveness.    Two research questions are addressed: 1) How do scale, scope, and specialization    affect retailers choice of organization, source, and governance of the produce    procurement strategies? 2) Given the effects of scale, scope and specialization    on specific aspects of procurement strategies, what patterns of procurement    strategies emerge and how are these related to differences in scale, scope and    specialization among retailers?</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The paper treats procurement as a meta production    function reflecting product transformation by retailers from an intermediate    good purchased from a supplier to a final product for sale to the consumer.    Treating the choice of procurement system as an adoption decision that requires    different fixed and variable expenditures, we decompose the costs (transaction,    transformation, and intermediate product) of alternative procurement systems    to examine tradeoffs that might exist among different types of costs. Hypotheses    are addressed using statistical tests for differences in means between groups.    Data are drawn from a 2002 survey of 33 retailers in metropolitan S&atilde;o    Paulo. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The paper challenges the notion that a single    competitive procurement strategy model will emerge - that is, not all retail    firms are following the same path to " modernization"  as might be assumed    by ignoring the scope, scale, and specialization effects. We use tomato and    lettuce procurement in S&atilde;o Paulo as an example. Lettuce and tomato are    two of the most important horticultural products produced and consumed in the    S&atilde;o Paulo area, yet their marketing chains are vastly different due to    the characteristics of each product. Lettuce is a highly perishable product    and is manually graded at the farm, and so frequently moves direct from the    production areas to retail stores. In contrast, tomato is relatively less perishable    and also amenable to mechanical classification, so it more frequently passes    through classification and distribution facilities between the farm and retail    store. These primary differences and other minor ones affect the costs and benefits    of different procurement strategy options, so are treated separately in the    paper. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>2. Empirical Context</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We use tomato and lettuce procurement in S&atilde;o    Paulo as an example. Due to their high perishability and infrastructure constraints,    as well as the significant demand presented by metropolitan S&atilde;o Paulo,    most of the lettuce and tomato produced in S&atilde;o Paulo state is consumed    in greater metropolitan S&atilde;o Paulo. Metropolitan S&atilde;o Paulo is a    city of approximately 18 million residents. Supermarket chains accounted for    70% of food retail sales (for in-home consumption), while independent self-service    retailers accounted for 25% and traditional full-service retailers the remaining    5% (Farina, Nunes et al 2004). Supermarket chains share of fresh produce markets    tend to be about 2/3 their share of food retail (Reardon and Berdegue, 2002),    such that these are responsible for an estimated 46% of fresh produce sales    in Metropolitan S&atilde;o Paulo. More precise recent figures on the share of    different retail types in fresh produce sales are not available. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">S&atilde;o Paulo is home to a diversity of retailers,    reflecting a broad range of scales, scopes, and degrees of specialization. For    the purpose of illustration, four types of retailers can be generalized as active    in S&atilde;o Paulos fresh produce markets, together representing chain, independent    and traditional retailers. The first group includes large, modern supermarket    and hypermarket chains. These firms are general-line merchandisers, carrying    both food and non-food items. Though they do not specialize in fresh product    markets, their scale tends to be very large, as can their scope. The second    group includes small and medium supermarkets which exist as independent firms    or in small chains. These are also general-line merchandisers and as such do    not specialize in fresh products. Both their scale and scope tend to be small,    but scope may vary broadly. The third group is discount green grocers. These    firms are specialized in sales of perishables, with a strong or even exclusive    focus on fresh products. They tend to be large scale but have a relatively limited    scope, reflecting their discount orientation. Finally, there are the small scale    open-air fair vendors who specialize in fresh produce. These generally tend    to focus on sales of only one segment of the fresh product market, for example    leafy greens, thus their scope also tends to be very small. The characteristics    of the different retailers with respect to scale, scope, and specialization    are summarized in <a href="#box01">Box 1</a>. Scale is represented by the floor    sales space allotted to fresh fruits and vegetables (Total FFV m2) aggregated    across all stores. Scope is represented by the total number of fresh fruit and    vegetable items sold by the retailer. Specialization is represented as the total    percentage of a firms revenue that is accounted for by fresh produce sales,    with higher shares of fresh produce sales representing higher degrees of specialization.    </font></p>     <p><a name="box01"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v46n1/a09box01.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>3. Conceptual Framework, Implementation Model    &amp; Hypotheses</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The procurement strategy is comprised of the    mix of organization, institutional arrangements, and sources used in the acquisition    of produce and its transformation from an intermediate good purchased by the    retailer to a shelf-ready product. In this respect, the procurement strategy    choice can be conceived of as analogous to a technology adoption decision where    the retailer chooses the procurement system to minimize the total cost of presenting    a shelf-ready product to the consumer. This cost is comprised of three parts.    First, transaction costs (search, negotiation, and contract monitoring and enforcement,    and other costs related to the acquisition of the intermediate input); second,    the cost of the intermediate input, which in this case is the cost of the produce    from the supplier; and third, transformation costs (including packing, packaging,    sorting, delivery, storage, and shrinkage of the product before sale to the    consumer). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Three inter-related decisions comprise the procurement    strategy. The first decision is how to organize procurement, specifically whether    to have centralized or decentralized procurement. Second is the source of produce,    whether it be purchased directly from the growing region or from intermediaries    in a central wholesale facility. Third, the retailer must choose institutional    arrangements<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><sup>1</sup></a> to support the    transaction, specifically product standards and relationships with suppliers.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Retailers procurement strategy decisions tend    to exist in patterns, reflecting tradeoffs among different costs that exist    among the different procurement strategy combinations. For example, purchases    from the growing regions are often seen in combination with a centralized procurement    and distribution system and formal relations with suppliers. Another common    combination is decentralized purchases from the wholesale market in combination    with informal relationships with suppliers. The prior strategy tends to offer    lower product acquisition costs but higher transformation costs as the retailer    takes on many of the functions otherwise performed by intermediaries. In contrast,    decentralized purchases from the wholesale market can reflect higher costs for    product acquisition but less transformation costs. The effects of different    strategies, and in particular formal and informal relationships with suppliers,    are difficult to predict, however, as different types of transaction costs (such    as search or quality verification) may have opposing effects. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Three variables are hypothesized to influence    the choice of procurement strategy: scale, scope, and specialization. Scale    refers to the total throughput volume of fresh produce of a retail firm (indicated    by the total sales floor space dedicated to produce) and comes into play in    two ways. First is the potential for cost savings from economies of scale particularly    through large fixed investments in procurement facilities. Second is the opportunity    for a retailer to use market power to reduce costs, most obviously by negotiating    lower prices in the acquisition of intermediate products from suppliers or by    volume discounts. A large scale of purchases can also potentially help reduce    transaction costs if the retailer buys enough from an individual supplier so    that the suppliers desire to maintain the retailer as a client serves as an    enforcement mechanism for any transaction agreements.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second variable, scope, refers to the variety    of different fresh produce products or items that are marketed by a retail firm.    Scope is indicated by the total number of different items carried by the firm.    Like scale, scope can offer potential cost savings through investment in large    capacity facilities and processes. Economies of scope will offer potential for    cost savings if these facilities and processes can work with numerous different    types of products at once. Additional savings can also be achieved if retailers    tend to purchase numerous products from the same suppliers, giving rise to the    potential to negotiate price discounts if " bundles"  of products are    purchased (analogous to volume discounts). Furthermore, if scope is small, then    transaction and transformation expenses may be less important considerations    for a retailer who will be dealing with fewer suppliers and fewer products,    even as it is buying relatively more volume of each product than a firm of the    same scale that has a larger scope. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Specialization refers to the degree to which    a retail firm depends on fresh produce for its revenue flow and is indicated    by the share of the firms revenue contributed by fresh produce sales. It is    also an important factor determining the relative benefits of different procurement    strategies. If produce does not constitute a large portion of the retailers    total revenue, it might prefer to save on transactions and transformation expenses    in exchange for a higher purchase price, as the former costs tend to be more    demanding of the firms internal resources (labor, space) than the latter. Conversely,    as fresh produce becomes more and more important in a firms revenues, then    the retailer may have an incentive to devote more internal resources to its    transformation.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The hypothesized effects of scale, scope, and    specialization on firms choice of procurement organization, source, and institutions    are summarized in <a href="#box02">Box 2</a>, and outlined in detail below.    It is important to note that differences in the quality of produce merchandise    are not addressed here, instead a homogeneous product is assumed. This assumption    is defensible on several accounts. First, firms which operate in multiple locations    (such as small and large chains and open-air fair vendors, among others) often    target diverse clientele with different quality-price preferences, and thus    seek products of varying levels of quality simultaneously, while using a single    procurement strategy to obtain these. Second, major variations in produce quality    are often reflected in different product formssuch as pre-packaged and pre-cut    produce. The current research excludes these different product forms and focuses    on bulk produce procurement only. Though differing levels of quality can be    found in bulk produce, the variations are not as significant as variations in    quality among different product forms. </font></p>     <p><a name="box02"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v46n1/a09box02.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Hypothesis: Scale, Scope, and Specialization    Effects on Organization</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Centralized purchases and distribution are defined    as those for which a central authority in the firm (such as the head office)    is responsible for the majority of procurement and distribution tasks. These    tasks include the decision of what and how much to order, selection of suppliers,    submission of product orders, payment to suppliers, and the physical delivery    of product to individual retail outlets. A decentralized strategy is one where    either each individual store or a third-party is responsible for these activities.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Centralized purchases usually involve significant    investments in physical, logistical, managerial and communications infrastructure.    This infrastructure includes a physical purchase and distribution center that    can accommodate logistical methods such as cross-docking, a centralized ordering    system that links individual stores to the procurement center and the procurement    center to buyers (though internet, fax, and other business-to-business communications),    and skilled employees who manage the purchasing, distribution, quality control    and other functions. As an indicator of the significance of the investment involved    to establish a modern centralized procurement system, in 2001 CBD, Brazils    largest retailer, spent approximately US$10 million to establish a new purchase    and distribution center (with attendant infrastructure) for perishables. In    contrast to the centralized procurement system, a decentralized system involves    relatively little fixed cost investment as it relies primarily on individual    stores assessing their merchandise needs and making purchase orders after an    assessment of market conditions. The primary cost savings of a centralized system    accrued by firms with a large scale and scope will be associated with product    transformation, because, by aggregating the purchases of numerous stores, the    centralized system facilitates purchases direct from the growing areas and vertical    integration of functions traditionally performed by intermediaries, such as    the sorting and combination of different product shipments for delivery to individual    stores, and quality control. Retailers with centralized procurement systems    make large fixed investments. A firm with a high scale and scope of operations    can thus benefit from scale and scope economies and often perform these functions    at a lower cost than traditional intermediaries. They can also see reduced transformation    costs as they have better control over processes and reduce the time between    produce harvest and sale to consumer, thus reducing shrinkage. Thus it is hypothesized    that scale and scope will be positively correlated with the centralization of    procurement strategies.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A high degree of specialization is also hypothesized    to be correlated with the decision to centralize. A highly specialized firm    can be expected to have its resources dedicated to specialized procurement activities    within the firm, which is consistent with a centralized procurement strategy    in which a core set of resources (i.e. labor and facilities) are dedicated to    procurement and transformation activities for all the stores in the firm. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Hypothesis: Scale, Scope, and Specialization    Effects on Source</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Retailers can purchase fresh products from a    number of sources and often purchase from a combination of different sources.    These sources can be categorized as either wholesale sources or growers. In    this analysis, purchases from wholesalers mean that the retailer buys at least    2/3 of its produce from wholesalers who are in the public wholesale markets    and distributors who buy from the wholesale markets or growers and distribute    to different retailers. If a retailer buys from growers, this means that at    least 2/3 of his produce is sourced from growers, including both farmers and    grower-packer-shippers who are based in the growing areas and sell both merchandise    that they have produced as well as that purchased from other farmers. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The most obvious difference achieved by choice    of source is in product acquisition costs. By purchasing from the growing regions    (often in combination with centralized purchases in which the retailer integrates    traditional intermediary functions), the retailer eliminates a link in the marketing    chain, reducing the price it pays for product. There are also potential savings    in transaction and transformation costs. With respect to transaction costs,    one of the key factors distinguishing growers from wholesale market intermediaries    as suppliers is the ease with which substitutes can be found if a supplier fails    on any given transaction. In general, wholesale intermediaries are easily substitutabletheir    concentration in a centralized physical location (the wholesale market) means    that alternative suppliers can be found should a specific supplier fail. In    contrast, growers tend to be physically dispersed and less easily substitutable.    There are also important differences in business practices of the twoa reliance    on advance purchase orders submitted to growers, for example, versus more day-of    purchases from wholesalers. Thus, buying directly from the growing region can    be expected to result in higher fixed transaction costs but lower variables    ones, all else held equal. Likewise, the retailer will tend to require more    established relationships in which product requirements and purchases are fixed    in advance which result in high fixed search costs (for the supplier, not the    product) but lower costs for monitoring of individual transactions. Thus larger    scale retailers are hypothesized to be more likely to buy from growers. The    same hypothesis does not hold for scope. A retailer with a large scope will    have more products to purchase. Unless individual growers can meet numerous    product needs at once, the retailer is more likely to economize on transaction    costs by seeking out suppliers who are concentrated in the wholesale market,    assuming specific product needs can be accommodated through this market outlet.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A high degree of specialization is hypothesized    to increase the likelihood of purchases from the growing region. A firm that    relies more on fresh produce for its revenue can be expected to invest more    of its limited resources in product acquisition and transformation, particularly    if this results in savings on purchase costs due to elimination of intermediaries.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Hypothesis: Scale, Scope, and Specialization    Effects on Institutional Arrangements</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The third decision considers the institutional    arrangements, specifically relationships with suppliers and quality standards    that will support the transaction. Relationships can either be constituted by    formal contracts or informal, ongoing relationships. Formal relations include    the use of " preferred supplier lists"  or registries or formal contracts    with suppliers. Informal relations with suppliers include both anonymous (" spot    market" ) relations in which the identity of the supplier is unimportant    to the retailer, and ongoing but informal at-will relationships with suppliers.    Likewise, the quality standards used can be informal or formal. Informal standards    are those that rely on the default public standard (which is subjectively defined    and not enforced) or shared understandings between the retailer and supplier    of what the retailers needs are. Formal ones are explicitly defined, with published    technical parameters, for example, and monitored and enforced either by the    buyer or seller or third party certifiers.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The decision to rely on formal or informal relationships    and standards are expected to be similarly affected by scale, scope, and specialization.    Two reasons underlie this expectation: First, both relationships and standards    reflect similar economic characteristics in terms of having high costs to establish    and potentially low monitoring and enforcement costs on a per-unit basis. Second,    the choices are interdependent. For example, a retailer who imposes a private    standard that requires highly specific investments on the part of a supplier    (such as investments in green houses or food safety certification), can help    to assure the supplier of a market for his product by offering a formal purchase    contract. Given the weak institutional environment in Brazil, particularly the    lack of enforced public grades and standards for vegetables, the decision to    rely on public standards reflects high variable transaction and transformation    costs, as good quality product must be searched for, often by physically inspecting    the product. Thus, sorting and shrinkage costs will typically be high, even    though it will be easy to find suppliers to comply with the less stringent product    and relationship requirements. The decision to promulgate private grades and    standards, on the other hand, involves high fixed costs of establishing the    standards and finding suppliers who are willing and able to meet them. Once    they are established, however, monitoring and enforcement costs are reduced,    particularly if a formal contractual relationship is maintained. Thus, a firms    with a larger scale of operations can be expected to be more likely to rely    on formal standards. In contrast, for a retailer with a large scope but limited    scale for each item, the high cost of establishing standards for each individual    product and the accompanying transaction costs of monitoring and enforcing the    standards can be expected to increase the likelihood of relying on a public    standard. The effect of specialization in fresh produce on relationships and    standards does not carry any prior expectations. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>4. Data &amp; Methods</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Data are drawn from the results of a survey of    33 retailers in metropolitan S&atilde;o Paulo, conducted in 2002. The survey    collected information on the characteristics of the retailers, their product    offerings, and procurement strategies for lettuce and tomato. Surveys were conducted    by the primary author at the retail site (or headquarters for chains) with the    firms head produce buyer as respondent, with the single exception of a large    chain which did not permit a site visit but responded to the questionnaire over    email. Interview requests were made by the primary author on the basis of " cold    calling"  to retailers listed in the phone book, except in the case of open    air fair vendors in which initial visits and interview requests were made in    person, and large chains which were referred through industry contacts. An effort    was made to obtain representation by each of the major types of retailers in    S&atilde;o Paulo, these being large chains, small and medium-sized chains and    independents, discount green grocers, and open-air fair vendors. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The data are analyzed in two different ways.    First, looking at tomatoes and lettuce separately, the effects of scale, scope    and specialization on retailers choices of organization, institutional arrangements    and sources underlying their procurement strategies are addressed using statistical    tests for differences in means between groups. Second, cluster analysis is used    to group retailers on the basis of their choices of how to organize, source,    and govern their procurement. Separate groups with characteristic procurement    strategies are distinguished for tomato and lettuce, and hypotheses regarding    the influence of scale, scope, and specialization on these strategies are addressed    using tests for differences in means. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The non-normal distribution of the variables    and the small sample size make the Mann-Whitney rank sum test to test for differences    between groups on the basis of the hypothesized variables appropriate (SPSS,    1999). Results are considered to be statistically significant at a 10% confidence    level, owing to the small size of the sample.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>5. Results &amp; Discussion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Scale, scope &amp; specialization effects    on specific procurement strategy aspects</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="#box03">Boxes 3</a> and <a href="#box04">4</a>    report the results of hypothesis testing for the effects of scale, scope, and    specialization on specific components of retailers strategies for the procurement    of tomatoes and lettuce, respectively. For tomatoes, increases in both scale    and scope are correlated with reliance on centralized procurement, while specialization    has no statistically significant effect. These results are consistent with the    hypotheses. For lettuce, in contrast, none of the hypothesized variables are    associated with an increase in use of centralized procurementindeed only one    firm in the sample relied on such an organizational strategy for procurement.    Comparing lettuce to the results for tomatoes suggests that in the current environment,    the characteristics of lettuce are such that potential efficiency gains to procurement    through centralization are insignificant compared to the costs of such a strategymost    likely reflected in high rates of product spoilage and lower quality (hence    lower sale prices), particularly given the lack of a cold chain for the product.    </font></p>     <p><a name="box03"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v46n1/a09box03.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><a name="box04"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v46n1/a09box04.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The results of retailers sourcing strategies    for tomatoes also support the hypothesis that scale and scope encourage purchases    from the growing region, while specialization again has no statistically-significant    correlation. Considering that tomatoes were sourced from both S&atilde;o Paulo    and outside regions, it is possible that the lack of statistical significance    of the effect of specialization in the choice of the tomato source is an indication    that both growing area and wholesale market have relative strengths or that,    in fact, they do not have any outstanding differences. For example, as previously    noted, all tomatoes sold pass through a classification plant owned by a grower-shipper    intermediary, and many of these firms have operations in regions other than    S&atilde;o Paulo state. This flexibility could, along with other factors, contribute    to different sources being interchangeable or differentiated on the basis of    other factors. In contrast, for lettuce, increases in scale and decreases in    specialization are shown to be correlated with purchase from the growing region,    while scope has no statistically significant effect. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There was little variation within firms with    respect to their choices of formal or informal institutional arrangements. With    the exception of only two firms in the sample, all firms that relied on formal    relationships with their suppliers likewise had formal standards, and vice versa.    Thus, the analysis focused on the choice of relationship alone, representing    institutional arrangements in general. For both lettuce and tomatoes, scale    and scope are both positively correlated with reliance on formal governance    of relationships with suppliers. For both tomatoes and lettuce, specialization    is negatively correlated with reliance on formal relations with suppliers. It    is possible that the negative correlation is indicative of more specialized    firms having sunk, social capital investments in relationships, making formal    governance unnecessary for their needs. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>Scale, scope &amp; specialization effects    on procurement strategy patterns</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cluster analysis of retailers choices of procurement    strategy for tomato and lettuce led to the identification of two groups, each    with a characteristic procurement strategy. The first group, into which 21%    of the tomato retailers fell, relied on centralized organization or procurement,    purchases from the growing region, and formal relationships with suppliers.    The second group accounted for the remainder of the retailers (79%) and was    characterized by reliance on decentralized organization, purchases from the    wholesale market, and informal relations with suppliers. The two general procurement    strategies identified for lettuce were largely similarone group purchased from    the wholesale market, and another group purchased from the growing region, but    in both cases purchases were decentralized and informal relationships with suppliers    were predominant. Decentralized purchases for lettuce are common due to the    highly perishable characteristic of the product, which encourages direct distribution    among stores rather than routing the product through a central private distribution    center, particularly given the lack of a cold chain. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="#box05">Boxes 5</a> and <a href="#box06">6</a>    summarize the test results for differences in groups belonging to each cluster    for tomatoes and lettuce, respectively. As can be seen, scale, scope, and specialization    have differing influences depending on the product. For tomatoes, a large scale    and scope of operations has a strong correlation with the use of a centralized    procurement system that sources from the growing region with formal relationships    with suppliers. Specialization has no statistically significant effect however.    For lettuce, consistent with the results from tomato data, a larger scale of    operations is correlated with purchases from the growing region. However, in    contrast to tomatoes, scope is not correlated with purchases from the growing    region, while those firms less specialized in fresh produce sales also purchase    from the growing region with more frequency than the highly specialized firms.    This last result runs contrary to the hypothesis that highly specialized firms    would have the incentive to buy directly from the growing region to save on    purchase and transaction costs and to ensure the highest possible quality. A    possible explanation for this result is that highly-specialized firms may be    more traditional in nature, and so may be embedded in long-term relationships    with suppliers at the wholesale market, and/or they may lack the infrastructure    (such as trucks) or scale necessary to buy from the growing region. In either    case, this would be an indication of impediments to what might be competitiveness-enhancing    adjustments to their strategies by these retailers.</font></p>     <p><a name="box05"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v46n1/a09box05.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><a name="box06"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v46n1/a09box06.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>6. Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tests of hypotheses regarding the relationship    between retailers scale, scope, and specialization and their procurement strategies    for fresh produce largely supported hypotheses. Scale and scope were positively    correlated with reliance on procurement strategies that were patterned on centralized    procurement, purchases from the growing area, and formal institutions to govern    procurement of tomatoes. Firms purchasing lettuce directly from the growing    regions had a significantly higher scale and lesser degree of specialization    than those purchasing from wholesale markets, despite there being no difference    in their organization or governance methods.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Decomposing the procurement strategy provided    further insight into the effects of scale, scope, and specialization on specific    aspects of the strategy. Overall, the effects of scale on procurement strategy    decisions were as hypothesized. Scope was shown to have similar effects as scale,    being associated with an increase in purchases from the growing region and greater    reliance on formal relations. Specialization, on the other hand, was shown to    be negatively correlated with these practices.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The significance of these results lies in the    insight they provide into the diverse procurement strategies employed by retailers    in S&atilde;o Paulos fresh product markets and their affirmation of the relevance    of these diverse strategies to the economic vitality of these heterogeneous    actors. The significance of scale, scope, and specialization in various aspects    of retailers procurement strategies is supportive of the argument that the    divergence of small retailers procurement strategies from large firms strategies    is not necessarily an indication of their being less efficient. Instead, the    existence of diverse procurement strategies among firms can be argued to exist    on efficiency grounds. This result is consistent with the findings of other    research on retail strategies in Brazil, such as Farina <I>et al (</I>cited    previously), which show the importance of diverse merchandising strategies to    accommodate the great heterogeneity of demand among consumers in metropolitan    S&atilde;o Paulo (which is also present in the majority of large urban markets    worldwide). Two important extensions to this research would be to: 1) undertake    further analysis with a larger sample, enabling econometric testing for interaction    among the variables and procurement strategy components, and 2) using measures    of firm performance to test for the relative efficiency of different strategies    holding scale, scope, and specialization constant. It would also be worthwhile    to undertake further research on how other factors, such as the location of    a retail establishment and its clientele, affect is procurement strategies.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>7.

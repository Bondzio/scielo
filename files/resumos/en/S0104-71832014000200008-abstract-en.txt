In this article I analyze the public narratives of violence and grief in the implementation of a reparatory policy related to the political persecutions during the 1964-1985 military government in Brazil. The public and itinerant sessions in which the petitions for economic repair and amnesty policy were analyzed on the bases of the 10559 law, and which came to be known as the 'Caravans da Anistia', were the scenario of the ethnographic research for the reflections on role of the narratives and testimonies brought about in such context. I sustain that the 'Caravanas' constitute a peculiar political scene and an arena for the enunciation and hearing of narratives about the violence suffered by the people involved, in a discursive chain in which the positions of speaker and listener alternate uninterruptedly. Such narratives and testimonies are granted diverse roles; they can be taken as arguments in the struggle for the reparations targeted, as the revelation of some personal grief that had never been spoken out so far or, still, as a form of refreshing the victims' engagements and the claims for some other forms of reparation.

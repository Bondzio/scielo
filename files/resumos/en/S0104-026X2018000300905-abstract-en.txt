Abstract: The present paper looks at the historical background of the rise of feminism and women&#8217;s movement and doing gender in India. Not only in India but all over the world there has been a close link between feminism and the women&#8217;s movement, each inspiring and enriching the other. In the Indian context, while the women&#8217;s movement is a much earlier phenomenon, the term Feminism is a modern one. Feminism comprises a number of social, cultural and political movements, theories and moral philosophies concerned with gender inequalities and equal rights for women. In the pre-independence era, the women&#8217;s movement began as a social reform movement in the 19th century. At this time, the western idea of liberty, equality and fraternity was being imbibed by our educated elite through the study of English and the contact with west. This western liberalism was extended to the women&#8217;s question and was translated into a social reform movement. In the post-Independence period during the first few decades, the major concern was for overall economic growth. This was immediately followed by another decade, which witnessed an increased concern for equity and poverty alleviation. Gender issues were subsumed in poverty related concerns and there were no such specific programs, which aimed at women. In the post-independence period, the women&#8217;s movement has concerned itself with a large number of issues such as dowry, women&#8217;s work, price rise, land rights, political participation of women, Dalit women and marginalized women&#8217;s right, growing fundamentalism, women&#8217;s representation in the media etc. and a large number of Non-Government organizations have taken up this issue. Women&#8217;s studies and now Gender studies is also an off shoot of the long history of women&#8217;s movement in India. Various women&#8217;s studies Centres have been set up and today again these are at the brink of disappearing from the radar and there is a struggle which is now going on. Though a lot needs to be achieved and there are various impediments in making this reality available to a large section of women, the women&#8217;s movement has brought women&#8217;s issues center stage and made them more visible.

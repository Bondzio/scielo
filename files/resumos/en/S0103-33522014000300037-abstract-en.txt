The article discusses different approaches to the connections between the right to abortion and the concept of autonomy. It starts froma brief presentation of the main axes in liberal arguments for the right to abortion. Then it discusses the displacements produced on those arguments by feminist approaches that either broaden or oppose liberal framings. At this point, the discussion underlines critical approaches to restricted comprehensions of choices, focusing on the contexts in which those choices take place and its implications. It also underlines feminist critics to the abstract notion of individual in liberalism, discussing their meanings and their limits in the debate about the "ethics of care". Finally, a brief conclusion brings together the value of autonomy and the meaning of life, redefined once feminist arguments based on women's experiences have been considered.

This work describes the conclusion of the dissertation in Education, finished in 1997. The object of the dissertation was the professional who deals with children under six years in Brazilian pre-schools. The results of the research presented in this work led to the conclusion that the image continually reinforced of this professional was naturally a born educator, passive, patient, loving, who knows how to act with common sense, is guided by heart, to detriment of professional formation. The undervaluing of this professional in terms of salary, the inferiority in relation to other colleagues, the links of this work with domestic labour and private life, as well as the deficiencies of training appear as the results of this image based on widely divulged gender determinations and mythification of this professional who is unable to free herself from the myths linking mother and child.

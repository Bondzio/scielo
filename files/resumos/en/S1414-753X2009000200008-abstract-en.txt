ABSTRACT The biological station of Los Tuxtlas belongs to the National Autonomous University of Mexico and, although it is not a private protected area, it shares similarities and risks with this conservation scheme. These days, given the tendency towards more participatory and inclusive conservation models, questions are raised about the way that private areas can contribute to biodiversity conservation in a more socially fair manner. With this in mind, we analyzed the differences between two central actors in the Biological Station of Los Tuxtlas: the academics who work in the area and the farmers of the neighboring communities of Balzapote and Laguna Escondida. The analysis of 29 interviews shows a very academically successful station, but with little connection with the community. This situation entails environmental and social costs, and proposes the necessity to incorporate a more interdisciplinary vision of conservation in the station's work

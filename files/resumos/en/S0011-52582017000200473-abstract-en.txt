ABSTRACT This article&#8217;s main objective is to examine the academic cooperation networks and international mobility channels established by the Ford Foundation in Latin America, to have served as platforms for showcasing social scientists from the region in the United States. Our interest is in understanding how the interactions and links between various Latin American authors and several &#8220;diplomats&#8221; from this charitable institution were fostered in order to develop institutional and intellectual activities in the United States. The article places a particular focus on studying the origins of the Latin American Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, established in Washington in 1977 by means of Abraham F. Lowenthal&#8217;s personal efforts to manage and mediate. A historical focus is also employed to temporally and spatially analyze the author&#8217;s career path and his intellectual and personal ties developed with Fernando H. Cardoso, Albert O. Hirschman, Guillermo O&#8217;Donnell, and Kalman Silvert.

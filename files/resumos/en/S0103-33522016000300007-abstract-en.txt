Abstract In this article we undertake a genealogy of the conflict resolution field and its spread in different areas, identifying its speeches and practices. We specifically sought to show that the formation of this field is bonded to a process of reconfiguration of the political and economic capitalist system since the war periods in the end of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century until most recently &#8220;consensual post-democracy&#8221; period. Particularly in this period, we reflected on the possibility that the meaning of such discourses and practices is, above all, to empty the broad political debate through an appeal for consensus that limits or prevents the exercise of reflection and discussion for politicization of issues that affect the collective life.

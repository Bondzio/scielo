Abstract The sacred and the utile are found closely associated in the &#8220;Xango de Pernambuco&#8221;. The process ofinicialization largely coincides with the search of cure, while the sacrifices are both good to pray and to eat. Thus there isn&#8217;t a radical separation between the sacred and the profane, what a literal interpretation of the Durkheim&#8217;s sociology of religion could intend. However, in the religious experience of Xang√¥, there is a moment when the sacred means more than all the functional analysis, becoming, this way, the more-than-sacred, what appears in the party and in the static trance. So it&#8217;s from this transcendent experience, involving the emotional communion of the cult group that emerges a closer identity of each faithful people.

This study evaluates the consumption characteristics of sugar and products containing sugar based on data from the Brazilian Family Budget Surveys carried out in 2002/03 and 2008/09. The methodological approach consists in estimating the income elasticities, as proposed by Hoffmann (1983, 2010), to capture changes in elasticities as income varies. The results show a significant reduction in per capita consumption and expenditure with crystal and refined sugar in the period, while the consumption of sugar through products containing sugar has increased. In addition, the income elasticity estimated for industrial products was much higher than for sugar, suggesting that there is a growing preference for industrial products as income increases.

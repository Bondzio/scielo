Abstract Based on ethnographic research among the Wajãpi (Tupi speaking people, Amapá State, Brazil), this article takes a different tack to central issues in the ethnology of lowland South America: it examines Amerindian perspectivism and shamanism through the lens of quotidian relations of non-shamans with non-human beings, in particular with plants. This line of inquiry raises questions about how the world of others can be apprehended outside of the famous shamanic vertex, exploring other knowledge devices, such as the "logic of the sensible", imaginative capacity, and the existence of passages between natures, all of which enable communication in a general sense - a condition I call a "rarefied shamanism".

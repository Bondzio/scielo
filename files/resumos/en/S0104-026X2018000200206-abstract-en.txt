Abstract: In the search for women&#8217;s writings that talked about the female body, we found Maria Teresa Horta&#8217;s poetry. In her poems, the lyrical-I gives voice to a feminine body so as to untie it from the patriarchal domain. Therefore, there is a feminine voice and writing that derive from a bodily immanence initially manifested inspeech - as in Luce Irigaray&#8217;s concept of speaking as a woman - and concretized in the writing - as in Hélène Cixous&#8217; understanding of female writing. The theoretical path herein taken for the literary analysis of that writing is based on the feminism of difference. For Hélène Cixous and Luce Irigaray, theorists of the feminism of difference, by means of the empowerment of her language a woman subverts phalogocentrism and empowers herself, thus promoting a new possibility of articulating the woman in art and culture. Under such perspective, Horta&#8217;s poetry becomes libertarian, as it talks about a body what writes itself.

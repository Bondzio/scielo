Abstract This work deals with the predominance of a neoliberal strategy of the development in Brazil of the 1990's with a double objective. From one side, we're looking for demonstrating that the relation of business groups organized with implementation of that strategy has been less consensual than part of the pertinent literature suggests and, on the other hand, we suggest that, for understanding how and why it was adopted in Brazil it is necessary also to look at the state. To accomplish the first objective, based in a case study and at a historical analysis, we're searching the confirmation of the hypothesis according to the existing one, in the early 1990's, a national strategy of development being consistent with a conscience, in part of the academic circles, of the limits of that neoliberal alternative, in which refers to the stability and to the sustained economical growth. The second, based on an empirical survey and a bibliographical analysis, we're looking for the confirmation of the hypothesis that the presence of an state elite subjectively oriented can help to explain the predominance of a development strategy wisely supported in Washington Consensus. Our results suggest that, to understand how and why a neoliberal strategy of development could rule Brazil in the 1990's, considering the presence of an state-owned elite committed with the guiding principles of that strategy be a necessary condition.

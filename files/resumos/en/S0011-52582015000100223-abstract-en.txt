This article analyzes the treatment of the homo-parental family in the Brazilian and Spanish television. It highlights the cross-disciplinary aspects of family, society and fiction through a sample of programs &#8211; Hospital Central (Telecinco, 2000-2012) and P&#225;ginas da Vida (Rede Globo, 2006-2007) &#8211; analyzing, in both cases, how homo-parental families were portrayed and text-analysis of content. A methodological support technique was also applied through a survey with homosexual collectives in both countries in order to obtain consumption and perceptions related data. The findings ratify the representation articulated between desire and tradition in relationships, and the way these programs tend to avoid homosexual stereotypes. It was possible to notice the daring narrative in the Spanish series, along with a non-superficial approach of the couple formed by two women, while in the Brazil, the portrayal of the love between two men displayed limitations in its approach to the dimensions of affection-love and paternal-filial relations. Lastly, elements for a new line of cross-boundary investigation are outlined: the homo-parental family on television.

Abstract Despite the significant improvements in water quality surveillance, irregular settlements and poor sanitation conditions have increased the impact and risk of health grievances over the past few decades. The aim of this study is to assess the development of the Drinking Water Quality Surveillance Program in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, by measuring the compliance with water sampling and 2014 analysis plans such as the residual free chlorine, turbidity and total coliforms / Escherichia coli tests (Health Ministry Ordinance, No. 2.914/11). Results have shown variation between counties and regions. The Middle Paraiba Region has shown the best results and the North and Northwest regions presented the worst ones. Since 2009, there has been improvements in the conducted quantitative analyses. These analyses indicate better program implementations, mainly focused on the test to measure the number of Coliforms / E. coli. An action plan based on intersectoral approach with the aim to assure high-quality access to the entire population was proposed to overcome the current problems in the program.

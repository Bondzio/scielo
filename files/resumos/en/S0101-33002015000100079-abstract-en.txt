ABSTRACTIn the recent years, Brazilian&#8217;s business outcome has being deteriorating, with a growing deficit for the so-called petrol account. In an effort to subsidize the discussion of this issue, this study proposed to investigate the petrol account, as well as its relation with Brazilian&#8217;s trade balance between 2000 and 2014. The results allowed the suggestion that the relation discussed has not been stable during the long term period analyzed, while the most significant influence of the balance of petroleum account on the Brazilian commercial balance has been verified after 2007, in the aftermath of the international economic crisis, and has been intensified in the recent years. After this period, the volatile behavior of petroleum account, embodied in the worsening of its deficit, in a way, has been absorbed by the country&#8217;s commercial balance, in a transferring way.

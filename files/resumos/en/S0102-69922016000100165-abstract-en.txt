This article aims at analyzing some current topics in letters exchanged between the authors José Enrique Rodó (1871-1917) and Miguel de Unamuno (1864-1936). In these letters, we can see an intellectual project, that proposed to outline an exchange of ideas and relations between Spain and Latin America. Among the topics discussed, we can see: the debates of their books, the construction of a collective spirit in order to get an approach between the former Motherland and the former daughterland; their essayistic productions; political and historical conditions that Spain and Uruguay were going through; positivism and idealism, and finally, religion and science. All these elements have been discussed by the authors and will be resumed in the text in order to highlight, from his writings, an intellectual and spiritual alliance between the countries involved in the colonization process.

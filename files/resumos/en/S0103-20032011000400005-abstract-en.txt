This study evaluates the effects of trade facilitation upon bilateral trade pattern between a set of countries including Brazil and some of its major partners. Variables associated to trade facilitation are used to construct three indexes of facilitation for each country of the sample: two indexes of import facilitation and one for facilitating exports. The relation of these indexes with the pattern of bilateral trade is estimated using a gravity model constructed with bilateral trade data within the countries. The results indicate that the degree of facilitation when considering the countries either as importer or exporter is an important determinant of the international trade pattern.

ABSTRACT: This article proposes a cross-reading of two French authors, Serge Moscovici and Pierre Bourdieu. They have contributed greatly to introducing new concepts and new theories into the social sciences, in an attempt to identify possible complementarities that they, or even their most direct followers, have rarely examined. Particular emphasis is given to the themes introduced by the philosophy and sociology of science, on which both took positions potentially more convergent than divergent. Its integration will be all the more necessary as the acceleration of current scientific and technological output presents new challenges to social reflexivity.

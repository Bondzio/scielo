Abstract I analize the representations on citizenship, gender and body in the autobiography of Mar√≠a Rosa Oliver. On doing so, I am raising the reformulation of the normative concept &#8211;traditional&#8211; of citizenship based on the contributions of Hannah Arendt and Judith Butter, which allow to link citizenship to intersubjectivity. The choice of sources &#8211;&#8220;the writings of the intimacy&#8221;&#8211; is not due to a heterodox will in the field of historical methodology, but mainly to the idea that those writings question, in the same way, the complex tension between fiction and non-fiction, which is a central problem for the historical analysis already pointed out by Barthes (1994) and Joan Scott (2014) among others. There, it can be read the complex links between the every day and the political, the singular and the collective, history and sociology. This specifity is given by a claim of truth, referential illusion and/or the search of more or less explicit correspondence as appropriate &#8211;between the narrative and the facts related. One of the paradoxical effects of that search is the staging of the ever-elusive character of the language, of the inevitable discursive mediation of any representation.

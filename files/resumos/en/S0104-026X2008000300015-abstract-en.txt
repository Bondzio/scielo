The quilombola political project has gone through centuries in History in order to consolidate itself as a constitutional right. The quilombo has been increased by means of support of other parts of the Brazilian population, becoming itself part of a national political project aimed at building a democratic society. The contradictions concerning both the legislation and its effective application, however, mean a great challenge nowadays, once the quilombo incorporation within the judicial order has not been sufficient to alter both the practice of expropriation and land control, and along with that practice the precarious situation in which black groups live is evident nowadays. The state action that protects the so called quilombola communities has spread itself and can be considered as innovative practice at present, although it still demonstrates strong inefficiency, requiring a reinforced action as to political participation on part of the black social movements in Brazil.

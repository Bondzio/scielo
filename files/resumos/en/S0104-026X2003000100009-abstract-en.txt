Small Claims Criminal Courts, though created to deal with minimal offenses, are now found to be judging mostly cases of domestic violence.The male paradigm on which the creation of such courts was based causes a theoretical deficit for not having taken into account feminist criminology and gender. As a consequence of this deficit, court decisions reflect the banalisation of domestic violence and contribute to a massive shelving of suits with a consequent growing dissatisfaction on the part of the victims, all of them women.

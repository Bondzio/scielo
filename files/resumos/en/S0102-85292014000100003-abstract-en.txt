In this text we discuss current approaches to the assumptions embedded in views of the new developmentalism. We further expose the scope and limits of that approach using a structural perspective with the purpose of identifying intervening variables that imply the formation or upgrading of the idea of ??development in a South-South context. Regarding the new developmentalism, in the core of the argument we highlight a combination of economic practices exercised through the national state which focus on the state's own internal capabilities. Our argument analyzes current development actions from a superstructural perspective, offering a critical reading - a reading in safe surroundings - of what is thought to be national development.

This article aims to identify and analyze different issues and interfaces between anthropological studies on gender and sexuality, and social movements for women's rights and for rights for sexual diversity in Brazil. I argue that these studies, especially on the last two decades, have enlarged their issues, towards corporeality, self and subjectivity, agency, feelings and affects. Always reinforcing gender relations as different positions in power and hierarchy, the concept of gender is understood in the mode of becoming or becoming otherwise, no more identities, but identifications, proposing a rupture of dichotomies as heterosexuality and homosexuality, masculinity and femininity. These studies reveal the political challenges between the fight for human rights of women and sexual diversity and the fight for cultural diversity, as well as political effects from different choices of anthropological methodologies.

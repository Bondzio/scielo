This article discusses access to free television time for political campaigning (HGPE, Horário Gratuito de Propaganda Eleitoral) in local elections in several municipalities of the state of São Paulo. Empirical evidence reveals the existence of two different modes for local electoral campaigns in municipalities with similar characteristics (using social, economic, political and demographic criteria): the São Paulo state electorate can be divided between those who have access to television HGPE in making voting decisions and those who do not have access to this source of political information. Although the state's capital has provided this "electronic space" for mayoral races since 1985, other municipalities of the Greater São Paulo do not supply this resource; therefore, voters living in "ABCD" region as well as in the adjacent municipalities of Guarulhos and Osasco watch the televised electoral propaganda for candidates from the capital city. This article presents results from the research project "São Paulo Global Village", which sought to explain the factors that created this situation; it covers all municipalities that provide "electronic campaigning" for mayoral races.

This essay proposes a reading of Gloria Anzaldua's "La consciencia de la mestiza/towards a new consciousness", interwoven with a dialogue that looks at possible points linking modalities of thinking Chicana and Latin American identities, given Latin American and Caribbean obsession with identity, which has generated both fictional and theoretical works (as well as those that, like Anzaldua's, conflate the two genres) that resist polarization (even while incorporating it), through the recogniztion of a complex, multi-faceted culture in which the texts of the colonized/colonizing, oppressor/oppressed, dominant culture/dominated culture are inextricable.

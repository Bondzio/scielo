Abstract This review presents the book by the Canadian political scientist Christopher Alcantara entitled Negotiating the deal: comprehensive land claims agreements in Canada. Based on the theory of rational choice institutionalism, the study investigates four empirical cases of indigenous land claims recognition processes in Canada, seeking to develop an explanatory model to understand why some indigenous groups obtain territorial treaties while others do not. Similarly, the author list factors that influence the pace of the process, making it more or less expeditious. The book presents itself as a major example of empirical research in the field of indigenous politics, an underexploited area of Brazilian political science.

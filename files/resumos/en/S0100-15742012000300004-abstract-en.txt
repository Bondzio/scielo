My purpose, in this paper, is to deconstruct the links between curriculum and teaching/learning processes what I consider of paramount importance for difference to emerge from the curriculum. After analyzing critical and technical perspectives of curriculum theory and the curriculum policy that defined National Curriculum Guidelines in Brazil, I argue that the centrality on knowledge as main category of curriculum studies has been reducing education to teaching/learning processes. I defend that the responsibility of curriculum theory and policy is to block the hypertrophy of knowledge as central in curriculum. This implies to redefine curriculum as capable of instituting meanings, as cultural enunciation, as an undecidable space where subjects become subjects by creation acts.

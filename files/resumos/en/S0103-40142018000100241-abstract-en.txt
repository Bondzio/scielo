Abstract Ancient tillage, by Raduan Nassar, is a tillage in several fields of the archaic. In this paper, the author shows aspects of this tillage in the field of the Portuguese language, in which Raduan digs for words and lays the bed for their flow; in the field of earth, of a nature prior to human labor, where the character digs the space for his body; of the character within himself, his own body and his memories; in the interior of family intimacy, of paternal discourse, of the mother's womb, of fraternal love; and in the field of Literature, in the "text of the elders", in the ancestral pages of the West. All these tillages intertwine to settle the author's accounts with his own history.

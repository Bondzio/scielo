<p>This article offers an analysis of the polemic between neo-republicanism and
					Isaiah Berlin on the concept of liberty. Neo-republican theory argues that
					Berlin's concept of liberty allows arbitrary power to emerge, and that the
					characteristically negative association between intervention and liberty in his
					argument should be dispelled. This article points out that the concept of
					liberty in Berlin does not preclude intervention to prevent oppression. One
					theme present in Berlin's argument is that interference by Law is an instrument
					that assures the exercise of both negative and positive liberty. Taking as its
					point of departure the ideas of negative liberty and positive liberty, the
					article argues that, on the basis of Berlin's work, these notions are facets of
					a broader concept that involves primarily the freedom to choose among
					alternatives. It highlights the fact that the two lines of thought converge in
					seeing the exercise of freedom as subject to no ultimate ends.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>“Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep.”</em> (Isaiah
				Berlin)</p></blockquote>
<p>This article examines the polemic between neo-republican theory and Isaiah Berlin's ideas
			on the concept of liberty, and proposes a revision of the neo-republican critique of
			Berlin's argument. It emphasizes that, in Berlin's argument, freedom of choice is the
			central value in the concept of liberty, and that this idea should inform thinking about
			the tensions and complementarities between the extremes of negative and positive
			liberty. It then points out that the concept of liberty is constructed as the contrary
			to that of oppression, and the notion of intervention figures as a guarantee of freedom.
			Taking freedom of choice as its basis, it sets out the reasons why Berlin's thinking
			gave precedence to the notion of negative liberty. It also addresses the issue of final
			purposes in the concept of liberty and indicates areas of congruence between Isaiah
			Berlin's and the neo-republicans' arguments in that both deny the value of an ultimate
			end that justifies the exercise of liberty.</p>

<a name="idp3243072"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The two concepts of liberty and their leading critics</p>
<p>In 1958, Isaiah Berlin gave his inaugural lecture at Oxford under the title
					<em>Two concepts of liberty</em>. That same year, the lecture was
				published as an essay that triggered heated debate. In 1969, the essay was published
				in the book <em>Four essays on liberty</em>, the new edition of the text
				accompanied by a number of notes absent from the original edition, together with a
				long introduction in which the author endeavoured to answer a number of criticisms.
				The essay was originally written during the Cold War, and the imprint of that
				conflict was made clear in the text itself. Berlin described his purpose as to
				inquire into questions raised in the midst of “... the open war that is being fought
				between two systems of ideas which return different and conflicting answers to what
				has long been the central question of politics – the question of obedience and
				coercion” (<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN, 1969a</a></sup>, p.121). The two
				views of liberty – negative and positive – were associated, respectively, with the
				liberal democratic and communist worlds.</p>
<p>The essay had enormous impact and was discussed by numerous theoreticians.
				Illustrative of those from the left was the critique formulated by <sup><a href="#B22">C. B. Macpherson(1973)</a></sup>, according to whom the
				central value of the concept of negative liberty was the absence of interference:
				negative liberty demanded only a space free from interference by State, Church,
				trade unions, groups etc, and disregarded the fundamental consideration that liberty
				is subjects' ability to act according to their desires. For that capacity to
				materialize, resources are necessary. Macpherson argued that, as poverty does not
				constitute an interference, Berlin's concept of liberty ultimately did not consider
				it an obstacle. He saw Berlin's argument as relegating the endeavour to overcome
				misery and poverty to secondary importance, which thus entailed endorsing a policy
				of minimum government intervention, as advocated by <em>laissez-faire</em>
				thinkers or liberals like Hayek and Robert Nozick. A second critique, levelled by
				Gerald <sup><a href="#B21">MacCallum (1967)</a></sup>, had considerable
				impact in the Anglo-Saxon world, and even Berlin responded to it when his essay was
				republished. According to MacCallum, Berlin seeks to attribute validity to one of
				the extremes of liberty (in this case, negative liberty), which ultimately creates
				distinctions which are never clear. That imprecision results from the operation of
				dividing liberty. MacCallum sees liberty as a single concept: it resides in acting
				to do or to refrain from doing something, always against some constraint,
				interference or impediment.</p>
<p>In spite of the critiques, Berlin's formulation remained one of the most influential
				in political theory. The brunt of the attack, however, was to come from neither the
				Marxist left nor the neoliberals (many of whom saw little commitment to liberalism
				in its value pluralism), but from neo-republicanism, a theoretical current that
				emerged in the early 1990s and whose main exponents are Phillip Pettit and Quentin
				Skinner. This school of thought has established itself as one of the most important
				in contemporary political theory, seeking to mesh a normative political theory with
				research in the field of the history of ideas. Its point of departure was the
				critique of Berlin's conception. Phillip Pettit begins his classic
					<em>Republicanism</em> with a discussion of the concept of liberty
				before the division proposed by Berlin<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>]</sup>; meanwhile, in the field of the history of ideas, Skinner
				sought to restore a meaning of liberty contrary to Berlin's argument (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup><sup>[<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>]</sup>, pp. 08‐09).</p>
<p>Neo-republicanism intended to distance itself both from the neo-liberalism prevailing
				in most western countries and from Marxist thinking. Its chief authors also
				contested aspects of classical republicanism. Participation in public affairs was
				not regarded as the highest form of liberty: engagement in the public sphere was
				essential not because it was the proper dimension of liberty, but because it
				fostered liberty as freedom from domination (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT,
					2002a</a></sup>, pp. 08‐09). The question of glory, of seeking after action that
				transcends its time and attains perpetuity, which constituted a central value in
				classical republicanism, was abandoned by the neo-republicans in favour of
				participation by citizens aspiring to liberty so as not to be dominated; civic
				virtue demanded by the republic was an ordinary, civilised passion (<sup><a href="#B39">VIROLI, 2002</a></sup>, p. 13). Neo-republicanism
				reinstated the importance of the separation of powers as a barrier to tyranny by the
				majority, repudiating any sympathy for a populist ideal of State with the people as
				its incontestable master (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup>, p.
				09 and <sup><a href="#B39">VIROLI, 2002</a></sup>, p. 06).</p>

<p>Isaiah Berlin's concept of liberty<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>]</sup>
				comprises two poles: negative liberty and positive liberty. The concept of positive
				liberty involves the idea of citizens taking action for their own reasons and not
				from external causes; it is a liberty to do something (<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN, 1969a</a></sup>, p. 131‐134). Negative liberty, meanwhile, has to
				do with the sphere where citizens are free of any kind of interference from other
				individuals or collective subjects (<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN,
					1969a</a></sup>, p. 122‐123). It is important to point out that although these two
				liberties are different, they are not logically opposed; the conflict has arisen as
				a result of the course of History.</p>
<blockquote><p>The freedom which consists in being one's own master, and the freedom which
					consists in not being prevented from choosing as I do by other man, may, on the
					face of it, seem concepts at no great logical distance from each other – no more
					than negative and positive ways of saying much the same thing. Yet the
					'positive' and 'negative' notions of freedom historically developed in divergent
					directions not always by logically reputable steps, until, in the end, they came
					into direct conflict with each other. (<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN,
						1969a</a></sup>, pp. 131-132)</p></blockquote>
<p>Let us look at the critique that neo-republican theory makes of Berlin's argument.
				The neo-republican definition states that liberty grows out of a situation where
				citizens are not subject to arbitrary interference and can hold to their choices and
				actions among alternatives without fearing for their safety (<sup><a href="#B8">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup>, p. 51‐52). The need for intervention stems from
				the possibility that asymmetric powers in society – such as those of employers over
				their workers or husbands over wives – may undermine citizens' safety (<sup><a href="#B8">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup>, p. 119). Such intervention would
				represent no loss of liberty. Contemporary neo-republican theory admits interference
				as a mechanism for guaranteeing liberty and sustains that, in that way, it is
				undoing the opposition set up by Berlin, where interference is regarded as entailing
				a reduction in the sphere of liberty (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT,
					2002a</a></sup>, Ch. 1 and 2 and <sup><a href="#B24">Pettit,
					2001</a></sup>, Ch. 6). Neo-republican thinking distinguishes itself from Berlin's
				approach in that the evil to be averted is domination (<em>dominum</em>),
				characterised by a master-servant relationship. In that kind of relationship, the
				master can intervene arbitrarily in underlings' choices without having to take their
				opinions into consideration. Pettit stresses that domination can occur without the
				need for intervention, that threat and fear can lead subjects to restrict their
				choices in the endeavour to satisfy the dominator, who can force certain behaviour
				on them without the need to weigh their interests (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup>, Ch. 1, 2 and 3 and <sup><a href="#B37">SKINNER, 2008</a></sup><sup>[<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>]</sup>, p.
				409).</p>
<p>In his <em>Introduction </em>(1969b) to the book containing the text
					<em>Two concepts of liberty</em>, Berlin rebuts a number of criticisms,
				while emphasising other points in the light of writings published after his famous
						essay<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>]</sup>. First, Berlin
				confirms that the questions posed by the two polar concepts are not logically remote
				from one another, but that they occasion different responses<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>]</sup>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me say once again that 'positive' and 'negative' liberty, in the sense in
					which I use these terms, start at no great logical distance from each other. The
					questions 'Who is master?' and 'Over what area am I master?' cannot be kept
					wholly distinct. I wish to determine myself, and not be directed by others, no
					matter how wise and benevolent; my conduct derives an irreplaceable value from
					the sole fact that it is my own, and not imposed upon me. (<sup><a href="#B3">BERLIN, 1969b</a></sup>, p. xliii)</p></blockquote>
<p>The definition of positive liberty has two extremely important values to Berlin's
				argument. In the first place, is the idea of the agent's autonomy, the "wish to be
				somebody". Individuals are subjects, not slaves with no liberty to choose their
				behaviour; not disallowed as autonomous agents, but able to make free use of their
				faculties. As an agent, I am capable "of conceiving goals and policies of my own and
				realizing them"(<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN, 1969a</a></sup>, p. 131).
				Secondly, and bound up with this, is the idea that subjects aspire to setting their
				own goals without being forced to do so by others, for their choice of conduct to be
				a freely selected act, not something imposed by a sage (<sup><a href="#B7">BERLIN, 1997b</a></sup><sup>[<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>]</sup>, p. 110‐111). Both components are inseparable from the idea of
				freedom of choice. If personal autonomy is valuable, then there should exist a range
				of options to choose among, because that would signal recognition of individuals'
				ability to set their own goals (<sup><a href="#B13">CROWDER, 2004,
					p</a></sup>, p. 83‐86). The autonomy of the subject present in Berlin's concept of
				liberty entails no sense of moral perfectionism; rather it corresponds to a minimum
				status that subjects must hold, one which enables them to seek the ends they deem
				desirable.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wish to be somebody, not nobody; a doer – deciding, not being decided for,
					self-directed and not acted upon by external nature or by other men as if I were
					a thing, or an animal, or a slave incapable of playing a human role […]. (<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN, 1969a</a></sup>, p. 131)</p></blockquote>
<p>As the idea of positive liberty has changed over the course of history, so these
				values have been suppressed. The idea of subjects' autonomy was modified by the
				theoreticians of positive liberty in favour of a benevolent, but authoritarian,
				Higher Self that would lead individuals to true liberty, while preventing them from
				deciding how to conduct their lives (<sup><a href="#B3">BERLIN,
					1969b</a></sup>, p. xliv). "I must do for men (or with them) what they cannot do
				for themselves, and I cannot ask their permission or consent, because they are in no
				condition to know what is best for them (<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN,
					1969a</a></sup>, p. 151). At that point, in Berlin's view, the theoreticians of
				positive liberty betrayed the concept of liberty: "what had begun as doctrine of
				freedom turned into a doctrine of authority and, at times, of oppression and became
				the favoured weapon of despotism, a phenomenon all too familiar in our own day"
					(<sup><a href="#B3">BERLIN, 1969b</a></sup>, p. xliv). Key here is that
				Berlin is not criticising positive liberty as a whole, but its transformation into
				an authoritarian doctrine (<sup><a href="#B12">CROWDER, 2002, p</a></sup>,
				p. 88). What vanished with this distortion was subjects' autonomous use of their
				freedom of choice; rewriting Berlin's metaphor, from then on there would exist a
				higher Self that would show subjects which door they must go through.</p>
<p>In his Introduction, he emphatically rejects the possibility that the concept of
				liberty is identical to inner liberty, which should be understood as follows:
				individuals faced with arbitrary constraints choose to withdraw to their most
				secluded dimension, the mind (<sup><a href="#B3">BERLIN, 1969b</a></sup>,
				p. xxxix). Examining the example of the slave accommodating to the desires of an
				arbitrary master, Berlin concludes that the slave is not free. That is because
				liberty has nothing to do with citizens' withdrawing to some inner citadel where
				they can entertain their desires at will: removing the wish to act does not increase
				liberty. Liberty, in either its positive or negative sense, cannot be made to emerge
				by extinguishing desires and choices out of fear of clashing with authority.</p>
<blockquote><p>For if to be free – negatively – is simply not to be prevented by other persons
					from doing whatever one wishes, then one of the ways of attaining such freedom
					is by extinguishing one's wishes. I offered criticisms of this definition, and
					of this entire line of thought in the text, without realizing that it was
					inconsistent with the formulation with which I began. If degrees of freedom were
					a function of the satisfaction of desires, I could increase freedom as
					effectively by eliminating desires as by satisfying them; I could render men
					(including myself) free by conditioning them into losing the original desires
					which I have decided not to satisfy. Instead of resisting or removing the
					pressures that bear down upon me, I can 'internalize' them. This is what
					Epictetus achieves when he claims that he, a slave, is freer than his master. By
					ignoring obstacles, forgetting, 'rising above' them, becoming unconscious of
					them, I can attain peace and serenity, a noble detachment from the fears and
					hatreds that beset other men – freedom in one sense indeed, but not in the sense
					in which I wish to speak of it. (<sup><a href="#B3">BERLIN,
						1969b</a></sup>, p. xxxviii).</p></blockquote>
<p>Berlin's intention in using the slave example was to draw a distinction between his
				and the Stoic concept of liberty. His view is that, when citizens accommodate their
				desires to a narrow field of opportunities in response to some external constraint,
				and do so in order to adjust to that situation, they may gain in serenity or
				rationality, but this is not liberty. In other words, Berlin's argument points to
				oppressive domination exerted without any need for intervention, requiring merely
				that subjects submit to the discretionary will of another agent. To put it more
				clearly, no intervention is needed for liberty to be lost. In that light, the
				absence of intervention does not constitute liberty. This idea was repeated in
				several of his essays<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>On the second aspect. Berlin is emphatic in asserting that freedom of choice can be
				constrained as the result of intervention, whether or not it is deliberate:</p>
<blockquote><p>The criterion of oppression is the part that I believe to be played by other
					human beings, directly or indirectly, with or without the intention of doing so,
					in frustrating my wishes. By being free in this sense I mean not being
					interfered with by others. The wider the area of non-interference the wider my
					freedom. (<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN, 1969a</a></sup>, p.123).</p></blockquote>
<p>Here it is fundamental to underline that Berlin's famous idea – that the greater the
				area of non-interference, the greater the liberty – is associated with the viewpoint
				that for individuals to be free is for them to enjoy a sphere where they can make
				their choices without any interference, regardless of whether or not it is
				intentional, that might shape their will in a manner contrary to their desires.
				Enjoying a sphere free of interference, but in which they are oppressed, does not
				permit them to act freely. As will now be seen, when correctly understood, Berlin's
				argument does admit a certain level of intervention, providing it is designed to
				assure freedom of choice. The idea of oppression in Berlin resides in subjects'
				perceiving that their desires are frustrated by an action that disregards their
				freedom of choice. It may be suggested here that Berlin's idea of oppression is very
				close to the neo-republican idea of arbitrariness. The second clause in Pettit's
				characterisation of an arbitrary act of domination requires that an agent have the
				capacity to interfere in someone else's life without taking into account the
				interests and opinions of the person affected by that action; the action can be
				guided by the agent's judgement alone (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT,
					2002a</a></sup>, p.55).</p>
<p>The third aspect involves the theme of intervention. As noted earlier, criticism from
				the left considered Berlin a theoretician whose definition of liberty entailed a
				minimum-State policy. However, such a view corresponds to a rather narrow
				understanding of his concept (<sup><a href="#B13">CROWDER, 2004</a></sup>
				and <sup><a href="#B15">GRAY, 2000b</a></sup>). In Berlin's argument,
				intervention can serve as an instrument to assure freedom of choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>The bloodstained story of economic individualism and unrestrained capitalist
					competition does not, I should have thought, today need stressing. Nevertheless,
					in view of astonishing opinions which some of my critics have imputed to me, I
					should, perhaps, have been wise to underline certain parts of my argument. I
					should have made even clearer that the evils of unrestricted
						<em>laissez-faire</em>, and of the social and legal systems that
					permitted and encouraged it, led to brutal violations of 'negative' liberty – of
					basic human rights (always a 'negative' notion: a wall against oppressors)
					including that of free expression or association, without which there may exist
					justice and fraternity and even happiness of a kind, but not democracy. (...)
						<em>The case for intervention, by the state or other effective agencies,
						to secure conditions for both positive, and at least a minimum degree of
						negative, liberty for individuals is overwhelmingly strong</em>. (<sup><a href="#B3">BERLIN, 1969b</a></sup>, pp. xlv-xlvi, my
					emphasis).</p></blockquote>
<p>Berlin emphasises that liberty does not mean a laissez-faire model with no agencies
				capable of assuring certain rights, as barriers to prevent oppressors from blocking
				the exercise of liberty, whether intentionally or otherwise. The concept of liberty,
				as both negative liberty and positive liberty, requires some degree of intervention,
				without which liberty will wither and die. Even while recognising that, in most
				passages, Berlin uses the term liberty <sup>[<sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup>]</sup> to refer indifferently to rights and to freedom of
				participation in public affairs, it can be seen from the passage above that he
				conceives the idea that law, in the sense of obligation, intervention, should be
				used to assure liberty, in both the positive sense (freedom) and the negative sense
				(rights). The idea of influencing citizens with the sanction of law has no relation
				to the approach of "obliging citizens to be free" (an idea attributed to Rousseau),
				but is intended simply to protect the sphere within which they can made their
				choices freely. In the passage cited above, the intervention that Berlin describes
				as necessary to exercising liberty embodies the notion of protection, but not action
				endowed with substantive content to force individuals to act "freely".</p>
<p>Discussing T. H. Green's 1881 essay, Berlin writes that in that context – in the late
					19<sup>th</sup> century – the relation between employers and employees, which
				was notably free from intervention, gave workers only formal negative liberty, with
				no possibility of enjoying it in practice, because they were subject to their
				employers' will. In that situation, negative liberty is a "hollow gain", because the
				workers' will is subject to another's arbitrary will (BERLIN, 1969b, p. xlix, note
				1). Berlin argued that mixing "social Darwinism" with a lack of interference
				resulted in a loss of liberty for the socially disadvantaged<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup>]</sup>. Berlin's argument neither
				stipulates that liberty and social equality are in permanent conflict, nor that
				these two values must be compatible<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup>]</sup>. In certain circumstances, intervention designed to reinforce
				social equality can be an instrument for assuring liberty. However, it is not
				difficult to find a number of experiments in western political theory where the two
				terms are in opposing camps. Whether or not they are compatible will depend on what
				citizens understand to be the values governing the good life; in that respect,
				different outlooks inform different conceptions of justice, which may occasionally
				enter into conflict with liberty<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup>]</sup>. Berlin's argument does not consider it feasible to lay down a
				normative rule on the relations between liberty and equality, because his value
				pluralism entails the possibility of conflict emerging among the diverse notions of
				good, and thus precludes the possibility of harmony among them.</p>
<p>Liberty that may require intervention is an issue that logically raises the concern
				expressed by neo-republican theory that its thinking differentiate itself from the
				approach advocated by liberalism. This distinction is present in both past and
				present western political thinking<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup>]</sup>. Neo-republican thought characterises liberal political theory
				as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>But liberalism has been associated over the two hundred years of its development,
					and in most of its influential varieties, with the negative conception of
					freedom as the absence of interference, and with the assumption that there is
					nothing inherently oppressive about some people having power over others,
					provided they do not exercise that power and are not likely to exercise it.
						(<sup><a href="#B26">PETTIT, 2002b</a></sup>, p. 08-09).</p></blockquote>
<p><sup><a href="#B39">Viroli (2002)</a></sup><sup>[<sup><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup>]</sup> notes that the liberalism of Constant and Berlin
				makes no mention of liberty as the absence of personal dependence, because their
				concern is only with situations where arbitrary interference occurs (VIROLI, p. 38).
				Neo-republicanism holds that the law makes citizens free not because it expresses
				their will, but because it is a universal, abstract command that protects citizens
				from the arbitrary acts of others. Republicanism was seen to run counter to populism
				inspired in Rousseau, because it argues that the people are not the master, with the
				State merely serving the will of the people; in Pettit's terms, the people is the
				trustor, and the State, the trustee, of that will (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup>, p. 09 and <sup><a href="#B39">VIROLI, p.
					2002</a></sup>, p. 52). The key points of that relationship were held to be: the
				requirements of universality and common interest must be above the will of the
				majority; power must be dispersed throughout society and not concentrated in a
				single body; and, lastly, the exercise of power must be subject to constitutional
				controls (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup>, Ch. 04).</p>
<p>Later, in this book <em>Republicanism</em> (2002a), Pettit distinguished
				among currents of thinking that address the concept of liberty. Instead of dividing
				them into two as previously done, he proposed differentiating three approaches:
					<em>non-limitation</em>, <em>non-domination</em> and
					<em>non-interference</em>. Pettit distinguished Berlin's argument from
				the Hobbesian utilitarian approach. He felt Berlin gave just as much importance to a
				diversity of options as to protecting subjects' agency (<sup><a href="#B30">PETTIT, 2011</a></sup>, p. 715)<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup>]</sup>. Berlin's argument, however, he saw as favouring a
				strategy of adaptation, of accommodation by agents confronted by the will, whether
				manifest or not, of a stronger agent. Why did Berlin's argument not give emphasis to
				the issue of non-domination and interference? According to Pettit, this was because,
				in Berlin's argument, the only alternative would be to reinforce the positive
				dimension of liberty. With this tripartite division, Pettit seems to have managed to
				assimilate the criticisms levelled at him for the narrowness of his characterisation
				of liberalism and of Berlin's argument (<sup><a href="#B13">CROWDER,
					2004</a></sup>, Ch. 04; <sup><a href="#B14">GRAY, 2000a</a></sup>, Ch. 01
				and <sup><a href="#B20">LARMORE, 2004)</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As observed earlier, Berlin's concept of liberty embodies a rejection of oppression;
				it acknowledges that oppression can occur intentionally or otherwise, it just has to
				be perceived by the citizen; and, lastly, it requires intervention whenever this is
				necessary for liberty to be exercised in either its negative or positive dimension.
				In the same regard, there is no refusal of the idea of positive liberty as an
				integral part of the concept of liberty; subjects' autonomy is a central value for
				them to enjoy freedom of choice, and is fundamental in the concept developed by
				Berlin. The criticisms that neo-republican theory levelled at Berlin's argument can
				thus be considered refutable. If the concept of liberty is compatible with the idea
				of intervention, then it is important to investigate the relationship between
				liberty and end purposes in Berlin and in the neo-republicans.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="idp3388592"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The end purpose of liberty</p>
<p>Berlin's argument distinguishes between the concept of liberty and the idea of ends.
				Here it will be shown how his argument effects that separation and then the same
				process will be traced in the neo-republican argument. In order to analyse that
				distinction, it must first be understood how Berlin criticised the notion that there
				are ultimate purposes justifying freedom of action. In that connection, his
				criticism of the notion of historical inevitability will be examined.</p>
<p>Berlin's essay, <em>Two concepts of liberty</em>, revisited ideas already
				present in Benjamin Constant's 1816 text, <em>The Liberty of Ancients Compared
					with that of Moderns</em>, while at the same time deviating from them in one
				important aspect, the role of History. To Constant, the liberty of the moderns
				rested not on some hypothetical state of nature, but on History. That was where
				conflicts were staged, ancient institutions were supplanted by new ones, grounded in
				other principles in step with the march of History. Constant regarded one of the
				Jacobins' mistakes as having been to endeavour to impose institutions that
				disregarded individual liberty. That movement rested on the will of political
				actors, but not on the march of History, a mismatch that resulted in institutions at
				odds with the spirit of their time. To Constant, as to the doctrinarians, History
				plays the role of an authority that legitimates the principles underpinning the
				liberty of the moderns (<sup><a href="#B23">MANENT, 1994, p</a></sup>, p.
				85).</p>
<p>Berlin refused to ground the concept of liberty in History for two main reasons. The
				first was that metaphysical or scientistic views see History as accomplishing a
				theological or rational principle which at once explains events and offers a
				rationale for actions suited to realising that idea. In touching on the theme of
				historical inevitability (<sup><a href="#B4">BERLIN, 1969c</a></sup>),
				Berlin criticises theories that approach human phenomena on a perspective intended
				to discover forces working inexorably on political actors. On such an approach,
				scientists should properly occupy themselves with identifying the driving force that
				conditions actors, to whom one can attribute mistakes, "their ignorance" or "their
				rationality", always in terms of supposed laws.</p>
<p>Such a procedure would reduce the scope of liberty, because the more this principle
				is revealed, whether by scientific methods or not, the less possibility there is of
				agents' choosing. The laws of History point to a meaning whose value agents cannot
				choose or judge; the role of knowledge is then to keep actors from taking directions
				at odds with the principle; never to point towards other possibilities or different
				values (<sup><a href="#B4">BERLIN, 1969c</a></sup>, pp. 57‐58 and <sup><a href="#B16">HANLEY, 2007, p</a></sup>, pp. 166‐167).</p>
<p>Analysing Berlin's argument on liberty involves highlighting his examination of the
				Counter-Enlightenment and the Romantic Will. According to those principles, Berlin
				stresses, to defy the universal laws was an act of liberty, even though such an
				action might be irrational. Each culture expresses its own view and is at liberty to
				do so, and the values expressed in each culture's way of life are incommensurable
					(<sup><a href="#B8">BERLIN, 2001a</a></sup><sup>[<sup><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup>]</sup> and 1990). One of the aspects Berlin highlights
				most emphatically when he analyses these phenomena is the right of such movements to
				have the use of freedom of choice, as opposed to schools of thought which assert
				that human behaviour is determined by purportedly universal laws.</p>
<p>As regards the second reason, Berlin sees History and politics as fields of conflict
				among diverse values. Politics is unavoidable to the extent that various conflicting
				purposes are struggling to be achieved, and none can claim primacy over the others;
				their values are incommensurable (<sup><a href="#B7">BERLIN,
					1997b</a></sup>, p. 65). A conception of History or Reason with a single principle
				at its core would consider conflicts to be the result of false consciousness or
				ignorance, leaving individuals no choice of alternative. When Berlin analyses this
				conception of History, he is addressing the problem of liberty as well. The
				existence of inexorable processes reduces "the area of liberty"; in other words, it
				curbs freedom of choice.</p>
<blockquote><p>The more we know, the farther the area of human freedom, and consequently of
					responsibility, is narrowed. For the omniscient being, who sees why nothing can
					be otherwise than as it is, the notions of responsibility or guilt, of right and
					wrong, are empty; they are a mere measure of ignorance, of adolescent illusion,
					and the perception of this is the first sign of moral and intellectual maturity.
						(<sup><a href="#B4">BERLIN, 1969c</a></sup>, pp. 58-59)</p></blockquote>
<p>Given Berlin's criticism of this conception of History, now his concept of liberty
				can be examined in greater depth. If History is no longer the authority underpinning
				the liberty of the moderns as compared with the ancients, other values have to be
				constructed. To Berlin, the need to draw a distinction between positive and negative
				liberty arises not from their formal aspects, but from the conflicts between these
				two models. More specifically, the differentiation arises when positive liberty
				entails the existence of a standard against which reasons for action are considered
				legitimate. In other words, individuals are then considered free only when acting in
				accordance with a standard, which may be reason, history, religion or various other
				ends. Not all actions would be considered autonomous. With these values, Berlin
				argues, the theoreticians of positive liberty justify interventions designed to
				ensure that individuals conform to such a standard (<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN, 1969a</a></sup>, p. 236).</p>
<p>Berlin's analysis of the role of knowledge shows that his concept of liberty is more
				complex than a simple reading of negative liberty as the absence of intervention
				might suggest:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Knowledge will only render us freer if in fact there is freedom of choice
						– if on the basis of our knowledge we can behave differently from the way in
						which we would have behaved without it – can, not must or do – if, that is
						to say, we can and do behave differently on the basis of our new knowledge,
						but need not</em>. Where there is no antecedent freedom – and no
					possibility of it – it cannot be increased. Our new knowledge will increase our
					rationality, our grasp of truth will deepen our understanding, add to our power,
					inner harmony, wisdom, effectiveness, but not, necessarily, to our liberty. If
					we are free to choose, then an increase in our knowledge may tell us what are
					the limits of this freedom and what expands or contracts it. (<sup><a href="#B7">BERLIN, 1997b</a></sup>, pp. 102-103, emphasis
					added).</p></blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that knowledge cannot determine the content of free action. Knowledge
				can be a means to reveal options, but should not fix the only model of free action.
				To Berlin, the individual is always limited by belonging to a specific community and
				language, to national customs and habits, and his thinking is extremely critical of
				the principles of the enlightenment, with their abstract, rational concept of the
				individual (<sup><a href="#B8">BERLIN, 2001a</a></sup>). None of these
				limitations, however, invalidates the idea of defining the concept of liberty in
				terms of freedom of choice. In Berlin's argument, it is contradictory to define
				liberty as something beyond freedom of choice, because if a purpose is fixed for
				free action, then we are only free when acting in accordance with that purpose; that
				is, we are not free. In political debate, advocates of positive liberty argued that
				individuals can be coerced into acting for purposes at odds with their wishes,
				because it is the specific content of that purpose that in fact endows action with
				liberty. The logic of positive liberty can admit interventionary tutelage of
				individuals (<sup><a href="#B13">CROWDER, 2004</a></sup>, Ch. 04).</p>
<p>This is the aspect that Berlin criticised:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once I take this view, I am in a position to ignore the actual wishes of men or
					societies, to bully, oppress, torture them in the name, and on behalf, of their
					'real' selves, in the secure knowledge that whatever is the true goal of man
					(happiness, performance of duty, wisdom, a just society, self-fulfilment) must
					be identical with his freedom – the free choice of his 'true', albeit often
					submerged and inarticulate, self. (<sup><a href="#B2">BERLIN,
						1969a</a></sup>, p.133)</p></blockquote>
<p>Berlin's concept of liberty can thus be seen to point to a tension between these two
				dimensions, in that positive liberty entails establishing an end to which liberty is
				directed, as it is only a means to that end. Individuals are free only if they make
				a certain specific choice. Berlin argued that liberty should have no end other than
				itself, that is, to choose among options. Intervention, as deployed in Berlin's
				argument, must be directed to assuring freedom of choice.</p>
<p>In response to liberal theory, the neo-republicans formulated the concept of liberty
				as freedom from domination. Their argument endeavours to show that there is no
				unsurmountable conflict between, one the one hand, liberty anchored in common values
				and, on the other, citizens as individuals. In other words, citizens' liberty is not
				constrained by values common to the whole society.</p>
<p>In two studies of Machiavelli (<sup><a href="#B34">SKINNER, 1984</a></sup>;
					<sup><a href="#B35">1993</a></sup>), Quentin Skinner distanced himself
				from the contextualism of the Cambridge school that characterised his work on the
				foundations of modern political thought. His examination of Machiavelli's thinking
				sought a concept of liberty different from Isaiah Berlin's.</p>
<p>In his analysis of the importance of Machiavelli and the 16<sup>th</sup>-century
				English republicans, Skinner highlights ideas such as the common good and
					<em>virtu</em>, which came to denote an ability to realise certain
				contents, which involve both individual and public liberty. Intervention not only
				protects, but also leads to certain ends, which should be shared by society.</p>
<p>In his reading of Machiavelli's work, Skinner points out that free action is not
				constructed as counter to the idea of the common good; on the contrary, it requires
				citizens to be able to act in accordance with that kind of goal. The neo-republicans
				argued that the common good required for free action could not be realised by the
				action of self-interested citizens who, by some fortuitous mechanism (the "invisible
				hand"), ultimately produces a virtuous result. To Skinner, if that were the
				mechanism for producing the common good, the result would simply be corruption.</p>
<blockquote><p>Contemporary theories of social freedom, analysing the concept of individual
					liberty in terms of 'background' rights, have come to rely heavily on the
					doctrine of the invisible hand. If we all pursue our own enlightened
					self-interest, we are assured, the outcome will in fact be the greatest good of
					the community as a whole. From the point of view of the republican tradition,
					however, this is simply another way of describing corruption, the overcoming of
					which is said to be a necessary condition of maximising our own individual
					liberty. For the republican writers, accordingly, the deepest and most troubling
					question still remains: how can naturally self-interested citizens be persuaded
					to act virtuously, such that they can hope to maximise a freedom which, left to
					themselves, they will infallibly throw away? (<sup><a href="#B35">SKINNER, 1993</a></sup>, pp. 304-305).</p></blockquote>
<p>The mechanisms that lead citizens to contribute to the common good are the laws,
				intentionally constructed for that purpose, and the norms current among the members
				of the society<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup>]</sup>. The law not
				only protects citizens against despotism, as assured by negative liberty, it also
				leads them towards certain ends and protects a space in which a number of diverging
				opinions can emerge.</p>
<blockquote><p>To a theorist such as Machiavelli, by contrast, the law preserves our liberty not
					merely by coercing others, but also by directly coercing each one of us into
					acting in a particular way. The law is also used, that is, to force us out of
					our habitual patterns of self-interested behaviour, to force us into discharging
					the full range of our civic duties, and thereby to ensure that the free state on
					which our own liberty depends is itself maintained free of servitude. (<sup><a href="#B35">SKINNER, 1993</a></sup>, p. 305)</p></blockquote>
<p>To the neo-republicans, intervention compatible with the exercise of liberty would be
				such as reflected goods that were common to all. Such goods have no end in
				themselves and, in relation to them, citizens are at liberty to set the means and
				the ends they wish to attain. In that respect, such goods are instrumental, and the
				neo-republicans argue that such goods cannot be achieved by political institutions
				in isolation, but require citizens' support; to that end, civic virtue and
				participation are required of them as prior conditions for citizens to enjoy liberty
				to attain their own particular ends (<sup><a href="#B26">PETTIT,
					2002b</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B36">SKINNER, 1999</a></sup>).
				Neo-republican thinking places more emphasis on 'republican civilisation' than
				virtue as such, thus indicating that citizens are not required to take heroic
				action, but to adhere to standards of solidarity that benefit everyone<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup>]</sup>. On that approach, there is no
				heroic dimension; liberty-as-non-domination is encouragement to seek not glory, but
				safety (<sup><a href="#B36">SKINNER, 1999</a></sup>, p. 302)<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>In the neo-republican argument, the notion of common good that guides intervention is
				intended to be only a neutral value; liberty-as-non-domination affords citizens the
				security necessary for them, autonomously, to pursue whatever means and ends they
				are interested in. Liberty-as-non-domination affords citizens security, because the
				interference that the concept requires rests on law which is an expression of the
				common good. Given that the laws express a common interest, citizens are free to act
				according to their judgment and wishes without being subject to the will of other
				citizens. Contemporary republican thinking thus separates the concept of liberty
				from any relationship with a <em>telos</em>. Liberty embodies no ultimate
				end, except whatever end a citizen establishes. Accordingly, liberty is a means, not
				an end in itself, an instrument that citizens can use to avail themselves of a space
				where they are permitted to pursue their specific ends.</p>
<p>The relationship that neo-republican thinking establishes between the common good and
				liberty-as-non-domination is designed to respond to the criticisms levelled at
				liberalism by the communitarianists (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT,
					2002a</a></sup>, p. 124)<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup>]</sup>. The
				communitarianists regard the common good as a substantive conception of the good
				life formulated by the community. That common good, instead of consenting to a
				standard given by peoples' preferences, provides a standard on which those
				preferences are evaluated. From that perspective, liberty corresponds to
				self-determination, which citizens make use of from the moment they find they are
				secure from arbitrary domination (<sup><a href="#B38">TAYLOR,
					1979</a></sup>).</p>
<p>According to Pettit, if one espouses the promotion of non-domination, the first task
				to be acknowledged is that the politics required for the task cannot consist in just
				an atomistic project; it must be articulated at the level of individuals overall.
				The degree of non-domination available to a member of an indigenous population in
				Australia or Canada is closely connected with the degree of non-domination obtained
				by other indigenous groups. The enjoyment of that liberty is a collective act, but
				in a sense different from what is understood by the communitarianists: citizens
				enjoy a good that belongs to all equally; if not, that would mean that everyone can
				come to be arbitrarily constrained at any moment. The security that is available to
				all is a collective good, but the pleasure of enjoying certain ends remains tied to
				the group (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup>, pp. 120‐121).
				Liberty-as-non-domination is a community value to the extent that its neutrality
				assures the plurality of goods. The common good present in law that intervenes so as
				to assure non-domination guarantees expression to partial identities, it protects
				them, giving them recognition and a voice. Pettit argues that protecting an ethnic
				minority requires not just the right to file a complaint against discrimination, but
				also the power to organise a group and, in some cases, the right to live under
				government protection (<sup><a href="#B18">LABORDE, 2008</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B29">PETTIT, 2009</a></sup>, p. 50). What is of interest here
				is to underscore that, for neo-republican thinking, the common good that legitimates
				intervention and makes it compatible with liberty is content-neutral; it assures
				that diverse ways of life can find expression without suffering at the hands of
				arbitrary power. This theoretical school stresses that liberty-as-non-domination
				does not involve any idea of ultimate ends for free action and assures citizens free
				choice in determining what constitutes the good life. The interference that may
				occur is justified by the guarantee that it will not be guided by any specific
				content, but will only assure that citizens can make their own choices freely.</p>
<p>To neo-republicans, an institution can be permitted to interfere on the condition
				that it furthers the citizens' interests and does so on criteria shared by all
					(<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup>, p. 42). The instruments
				of a democratic State are means to promoting liberty for its citizens and not ends
				in themselves. Citizens' liberty is different from participation in government; the
				latter is understood as a means to assure the former. This aspect is directly
				connected with the neo-republicans' criticism of the idea of ultimate ends for free
				action.</p>
<p>Citing Berlin's argument in this respect, Pettit argues that the idea that the State
				should make a goal of improving its citizens would result in a despotic institution
				opposed to liberty<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup>]</sup>. To live
				under a free State is to be unconstrained to seek certain specific ends and to have
				autonomy to pursue whatever ends the subject, regarded as autonomous, has chosen
					(<sup><a href="#B34">SKINNER, 1984, p</a></sup>, p. 302). Citizens take
				part in public affairs because they understand that, in that dimension particularly,
				they enjoy liberty. The same approach was taken by the neo-Athenians<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup>]</sup>, but only because it is intended
				to preserve a sphere free of arbitrary interference. The defence of liberty depends
				on sustaining a polity in which citizens participate in view of the need to preserve
				their liberty (<sup><a href="#B25">PETTIT, 2002a</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B34">SKINNER, 1984)</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In that respect, in the neo-republican argument, the conception of the common good
				signals the notion that no group has arbitrary power over the others, which affords
				security and leads citizens, through laws, to contribute to that common good, which
				is, above all else, in the interest of all of them.</p>
<p>From Berlin, neo-republican thought inherited the idea that liberty should involve no
				ultimate end as justification of free action, and that the diverse ends that exist
				in society should be available to citizens<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup>]</sup>. Neo-republicans reject the introduction of ends intended
				to improve citizens or any intervention in which the values of one group, whether or
				not it is a majority in society, predominate over others. At the same time, the
				certainty afforded to citizens by neo-republican theory that they will be able to
				act freely is completely compatible with Berlin's argument that the autonomy of the
				subject requires an area free from oppressive interference. Pettit's 'arbitrariness'
				or Berlin's 'oppression' emerge when free action is forced to pursue an end other
				than that of assuring citizens the security necessary so that they can choose freely
				among diverse ends.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="idp3476096"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Freedom of choice</p>
<p>Having highlighted the dissociation between free action and ends, I would now like to
				examine MacCallum's criticism (MacCallum, 1967) of Berlin's argument, as well as to
				reinforce the core idea of Berlin's concept. MacCallum regards liberty as always
				characterised by a threefold relationship in which an agent (X) is (or is not) free
				from a barrier (Y) to doing (or not doing) something (Z). His intention in this was,
				by establishing a tripartite conception, to dissolve any distinction between
				positive liberty and negative liberty.</p>
<p>McCallum's approach starts from the same mistaken reading as the 'neo-republicans'.
				That is to say it understands Berlin's concept of liberty as divided between two
				models, positive liberty and negative liberty, thus obscuring its core idea. Such an
				interpretation fails to perceive that Berlin's concept of liberty resides
				fundamentally in the notion of choice.</p>
<p>On this point, Berlin's conception of liberty emphatically rejects the idea of an
				end, which is present in McCallum<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup>]</sup>. Berlin writes: "A man struggling against his chains or a
				people against enslavement need not consciously aim at any definite further state. A
				man need not know how he will use his freedom; he just wants to remove the yoke. So
				do classes and nations" (<sup><a href="#B3">BERLIN, 1969b</a></sup>, note
				I, p. xliii). In Berlin's argument, liberty is the act of choosing among options;
				performing an action without the agent's enjoying options does not represent
				liberty. It would be absurd to postulate a free agent with only one alternative:
				"Action is choice; choice is free commitment to this or that way of behaving,
				living, and so on; the possibilities are never fewer than two: to do or not to do;
				be or not be" (<sup><a href="#B7">BERLIN, 1997b</a></sup>, p. 96).</p>
<p>According to <sup><a href="#B38">Taylor(1979)</a></sup>, positive liberty is
				an exercise-concept, whereas negative liberty is an opportunity-concept. The concept
				of liberty formulated by Berlin allows a subject who refrains from acting out of a
				reluctance to infringe internalised standards, but who has a range of options, to be
				considered free (TAYLOR, pp. 177‐178). The emphasis on the idea of opportunity,
				which Taylor criticises, occurs because the agent's freedom of choice is central to
				Berlin's argument; with it, agents can fill their field of action with their values
				and ends. Having opportunities to act means agents' enjoying a diversity of options,
				which is as important as the action itself, and its materialisation is the end point
				of a process. Having the means, such as knowledge or money, but not having options
				and thus being able to apply the means in only one way, does not constitute free
				action. In Berlin's argument, action is present jointly with the idea of
				opportunities; they are not to be found separately. In that regard, central to
				Berlin's formulation of the concept of liberty is the presence of opportunity to
				choose among various ends, and the inseparability of that choice from action.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To be free is to be able to make an unforced choice; and choice entails
						competing possibilities – at the very least two 'open', unimpeded
						alternatives</em>. And this, in its turn, may well depend on external
					circumstances which leave only some paths unblocked. When we speak of the extent
					of freedom enjoyed by a man or a society, we have in mind, it seems to me, the
					width or extent of the paths before them, the number of open doors, as it were,
					and the extent to which they are open. (<sup><a href="#B7">BERLIN,
						1997b</a></sup>, p.110, my emphasis).</p></blockquote>
<p>In Berlin, the very definition of the extent of liberty is directly connected with
				the possibility of making choices, some of which are only potential, that is,
				subjects will not realise them, but Berlin argues that these possibilities should be
				within their reach: "The extent of my social or political freedom consists in the
				absence of obstacles not merely to my actual, but to my potential choices – to my
				acting in this or that way if I choose to do so" (<sup><a href="#B3">BERLIN, 1969b</a></sup>, p. xl). The point that confused his critics was that they
				failed to perceive that negative and positive liberty are defined by choice among
				diverse ends. Both dimensions of liberty are important as means to assure
						choice<sup>[<sup><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>It may be asked: why do so many readings of Berlin limit themselves to the idea of
				non-intervention alone? Any emphasis that his argument may give to the idea of
				negative liberty stems from the fact that ultimate ends are absent from that
				definition. Negative liberty does not require the idea of an end to justify the
				existence of a sphere free of arbitrary interferences, whereas positive liberty
				formally stresses the autonomy of the subject, thus rejecting the idea of an
				ultimate end that might justify any tutelage of the subject. The historical
				political debate, however, furnished positive liberty with the idea that free action
				would only be truly free if guided by an end, be it the market, social justice,
				history, equality or whatever. Berlin did not deny that positive liberty is
				necessary to enjoy liberty; the problem arises when its advocates postulate the
				suppression of freedom of choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp3496240"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Conclusion</p>
<p>The core component of Isaiah Berlin's concept of liberty is freedom of choice; to act
				is to have the opportunity to choose among several ends. Positive liberty and
				negative liberty are different aspects of this same principle, and historically they
				have come into conflict. The former speaks of the autonomy of the subject in
				choosing who is to govern public affairs, so that they assure freedom of choice.
				Negative liberty, meanwhile, has to do with the right to do or not to do, a sphere
				in which citizens are protected by the law. As shown here, interference should be
				used in situations where choice is threatened, but such interference should not be
				subordinated to an end. These two postulates are distinct and, historically, will
				come into conflict whenever the theoreticians of positive liberty endeavour to
				establish a model in which liberty is subject; that is, it is a means. In this way,
				Berlin pointed to a violation of the core idea of the concept of liberty, the
				opportunity to choose among various ends.</p>
<p>Submission to oppressive interference, whether the latter is intentional or not,
				violates the exercise of liberty. That idea was present in Berlin's argument, and is
				exemplified by the slave adjusting to the master's wishes. Republican theory sought
				to build a significant part of its concept of liberty on a critique of arbitrary
				domination. Intervention was regarded as a morally legitimate mechanism, providing
				its goal was to prevent arbitrary domination; such a structure would be controlled
				by law and by a participatory society. The concept of liberty-as-non-domination
				precludes any ideas of ultimate ends, following Berlin's formulation in this regard.
				A republican society, however, requires citizens who are moved by principles of
				common good, which could not be the result of an invisible hand leading
				self-interested citizens. In that respect, neo-republican theory qualifies
				intervention in a manner that had not been formulated by Berlin. In that theory, the
				model of free action requires not only protection against arbitrary power, but also
				citizens capable of establishing a dialogue with others, of voicing their ideas and
				being receptive to the values of other citizens. The communication dimension was
				entirely missing from Berlin's argument, concerned as he was to emphasise the
				plurality of conceptions of good in society and, as a consequence, the conflict.</p>Translated by Peter Lenny</div>

						Review</em>, Nº 64, in 1955), p. 282. <sup><a href="#B31">Pitkin (1988)</a></sup> draws a distinction between <em>liberty</em>
					and <em>freedom</em>, relating <em>liberty</em> to being free
					from oppression, to enjoying a space for action free from outside control, while
						<em>freedom</em> has to do with the possibility of participating in
					public affairs. The meaning of the term <em>liberty</em> is associated
					with the idea of legal rights that assure individuals that they will not suffer
					interference; accordingly, it is closer to the term <em>right</em>. As
					she points out, Berlin often uses the two terms interchangeably, disregarding
					this difference. At times, however, he does distinguish between them; whenever
					that happens, it will be highlighted here. Although Berlin's argument is
					semantically not very precise, whenever it involves an intervention sanctioned
					by law, that intervention is meant to protect a sphere within which individuals
					are free to make their choices. See Berlin, 1969b, pp. xlv-xlvi. This idea will
					be discussed later.</p>

					exclusively and restrictively to his famous <em>Two concepts of

					argument more broadly, so that it can be analysed in all its complexity. In that
					respect, it is a mistake to leave aside a number of other writings on the same
					subject. On the other hand, the Introduction – which was written 11 years after
					publication of the famous essay – should be considered as a complementary text,
					which at the same time reformulates various aspects and responds to the

					<sup><a href="#B33">Silva (2008)</a></sup>, p. 172, argues that
					ultimately McCallum's efforts corroborate the meaning of Berlin's conclusions,
					because there is only one type of liberty after all: negative liberty. Silva's
					error consists in failing to perceive the fundamental difference between
					Berlin's and McCallum's concepts. McCallum's concept of liberty show no
					similarity at all to Berlin's, because McCallum presupposes the existence of an
					end, while Berlin's rejects, radically, the idea that an end is a necessity for
					free action. In Berlin's argument, positive liberty becomes corrupt when it
					comes to depend on the idea of an end. On this difference, see <sup><a href="#B14">Gray, 2000a</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B15">2000b</a></sup> and <sup><a href="#B13">Crowder,

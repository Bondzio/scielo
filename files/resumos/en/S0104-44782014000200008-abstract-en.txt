The article analyzes the emergence, in recent decades, of a new international liberalism of technocratic nature, which contrasts with the classical liberalism created by critical philosopher Immanuel Kant. The new liberalism, which coincides with the process of financial globalization, reverses the emancipatory element of Kantian liberalism to present itself as an instance of power ratification. As a result, the new liberals are incapable of critically analyzing events such as the Great Recession.I propose principles for a critical foreign policy for Brazil, in contrast to the new technocratic liberalis. In empirical terms, I investigate the evolution of the globalization of finance from the perspective of power, focusing on the financial crises in the developing world and the 2008 Great Recession. I argue that 1) the new liberalism contradicts the classical liberalism; 2) the new liberalism legitimates interests of hegemonic actors towards financial liberalization and unrestrained deregulation, which are the roots of the Great Recession, 3) Brazilian foreign policy must bring back elements from classical liberalism in the context of crisis generated by the Great Recession.

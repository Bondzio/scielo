The imposition of the neoliberal model in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as the recent return to economic growth in the region are mainly due to the massive exploitation of natural resources geared to exports and which, to a large extent, are controlled by transnational capital. As a result, a growing number of conflicts, social movements and sociopolitical consensus building have emerged and developed in the continent on local, national and regional levels. These efforts are part of a new cycle of social protest that arose in the second half of the 1990s. The main features that represent the current makeup of the collective organization and action of today's social movements can be glimpsed in those experiences. In this sense, the defense of natural resources as a common good has been expressed in the social reaction against the devastation of the environment, the destruction of habitats and the forced displacement of peoples. It has also been raised in questions regarding the impact and the model of private appropriation of these resources and the benefits derived from exploiting them. In the field of social movements, the articulation of these processes has meant linking the cycle of resistance to the construction of alternatives and the positing of liberating horizons.

Abstract This paper analyzes the apprenticeship of sex work, observing the initiation in the activity and the development of skills, from an approach developed by Jean Lave, around the apprenticeship of social practices. The reconsideration of the data from a previous research and the return to the field in the Bohemian zone, a red light district of Belo Horizonte, with a focus on situated learning brought new contributions: it highlighted the interaction of novices with the environment in order to adapt their practices, as well as the importance of stories told among sex workers for learning ways of working, talking, behaving and dealing with customers. To think about continuities and differences in the modes of action of sex workers and the connections between the different contexts through which they transit also pointed out the socio-historical transformations of the practice of sex work in the Bohemian zone itself.

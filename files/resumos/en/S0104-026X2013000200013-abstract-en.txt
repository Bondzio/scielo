This paper analyses the importance of language in the translation of knowledge produced in the field of feminist studies and gender relations, considering the assimilation of the contents of this production by distinct audiences in the process of gender training, particularly by those who are not familiar with academic parlance. In this perspective, we seek to analyze two distinct strands in the editorial line sustained by the Nucleus of Interdisciplinary Women's Studies - NEIM/UFBA: on the one hand, Coleção Bahianas, edited according to the canons of "academic liturgy", and, on the other, the so-called "educative materials", which sustain extension activities that have "making oneself understood" as their guiding principle.

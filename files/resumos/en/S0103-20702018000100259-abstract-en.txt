Abstract This article focuses on the reality of underprivileged students who aim to enter Higher Education through their participation on a tuition-free &#8220;prep course&#8221; organized within the city of Sao Paulo. Firstly, the text evidences the internalization of dispositions, among these students, towards the prolongation of their educational trajectories through their taking part in the selection processes for accessing public Higher Education. Secondly, nevertheless, I argue that key aspects of their socialization and schooling trajectories lead to inadequacies and barriers between their incorporated dispositions and the exigences of such modes of selection.

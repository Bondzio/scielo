<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This work evaluates the economic efficiency of    productive resource utilization in the cultivation of soybeans in the state    of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The study area comprises the state’s main soybean    producing counties. Economic efficiency was estimated for a sample of 151 soybean    producers through the production frontier function. The producers in the state’s    northern region are operating near the established production frontier, signaling    a favorable tendency in resource reallocation and achieving efficiency.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><B>Key words:</b> Production frontier, economic    efficiency, soybean</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>1. Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The task of a professional agriculture business    manager implies adapting and/or changing existing management theory and practice    to improve an agribusiness’s economic results by successfully modifying its    agricultural practices. The agricultural professional must broaden his knowledge    and control of the production unit’s structure and functioning. Hence, analysis    of the technical and economic efficiencies of rural enterprise activity is becoming    increasingly important to these professionals.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Estimation of an enterprise’s level of economic    efficiency may help decision making directed to improve current performance    and determine the direction of new technological development intended to increase    production rationally. Furthermore, efficiency estimates draw attention to recognition    disparities between the production potential of a new technology and the actual    level of production.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The development of a new Brazilian institutional    environment in the 1990s increased economic competitiveness by facilitating    the linkage of the nation’s product and service markets and brought more efficient    production units. This efficiency came from lowered costs, rationalized production    scale, technological availability, and improved logistics (storage, production    transportation, and flow). In this setting, Brazilian agriculture found a new    challenge: to improve agricultural competitiveness through greater production    efficiency (which has become a professional business activity).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The soybean complex, according to Coelho (1996),    has assumed an important role in the Brazilian economy due to increased export    sales. This growth has had direct and indirect effects on the rest of the economy    and generated substantial income in states where soybeans are intensely cultivated.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The state of Mato Grosso do Sul is Brazil’s fifth    greatest soybean producer, contributing approximately 8.9% of Brazil’s total    production. The state producers produce 2.8 millions of tons of soybeans annually    and have achieved an average yield of 2.6 thousand kg per hectare, which compares    favorably with the national average of 2.4 thousand kg per ha. However, because    of high production costs and the great distance to market, the state’s soybean    producers’ profit margins are low. Because of the large amount of soybeans produced    for sale into the export market, international prices determine the prices received    by Mato Grosso do Sul’s soybean producers, and foreign producers provide important    competition. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Due to the restricted range of return that this    agricultural activity has yielded in recent years, market competition, and an    increase in production costs, production and investment decisions based on accurate,    complete information and business vision are fundamental to the maintenance    of soybean producers. The present work was designed to provide updated information    for use by soybean producers and other interested parties. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This study has as its general goal the evaluation    of the economic efficiency in the use of soybean productive resources in Mato    Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Specifically, we intend to estimate the soybean production    frontier and to identify the economic efficiency of the use of productive factors    by the state’s producers.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>2. Methodology</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>2.1. Efficiency measurements</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To analyze productive resource management, the    indicators of interest are the technical, allocation, and economic efficiencies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An economically efficient production process    is understood as one in which factor costs are minimized (allocation efficiency)    and production occurs on the technological frontier (technical efficiency).    The measure of economic efficiency is a combination of technical and allocation    efficiencies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From this vies, the technical efficiency measure    quantifies how near an enterprise is to maximum production when using the optimal    resource combination. Technical efficiency considers the relation between inputs    and final products, that is, deals with the physical production process.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The allocation efficiency measure quantifies    how near an enterprise is to using the optimal combination of production inputs    when the goal is maximum profit. Allocation efficiency exists when resources    are best allocated by an enterprise according to market prices and production    necessities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Studies about efficiency and frontier measurements    began with the work of Farrell (1957). He gave definitions for both technical    and allocation efficiencies, starting from the deterministic frontiers concept.    To define his concept of efficiency, the author considered an enterprise that    uses two inputs <I>x<SUB>1</sub></I> and <I>x<SUB>2</sub></I> in the production    of one product <I>y</I>. The technology was summarized by a linearly homogenous    production function, <I>y = f(x<SUB>1</SUB>, x<SUB>2</SUB>)</I>. This function    can be written as <I>1 = f(x<SUB>1</SUB>/y, x<SUB>2</SUB>/y)</I>, that is, the    technological frontier can be represented by a unitary SS’ isoquantum, as shown    in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. By definition, enterprises that operate on    the isoquantum are efficient as none is below SS’.</font></p>     ]]></body>

The cost at point C is the same as that at allocationally efficient    point D and lower than at point B. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, OC/AO measures the total efficiency    or economic efficiency (E<SUB>E</SUB>), which is given by the product of the    technical and allocation efficiencies. Hence, we have:</font></p> <table width="100%" align=center>   <tr>      <td width=95% align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n1/a03fr01.gif"></td>     <td wifth=5% align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="2">(1)</font></td>   </tr> </table>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Efficiency analysis provides technical and economic    indicators of the degree of efficiency with which an enterprise uses its inputs    in the production process. Hence, an efficient production unit is one that achieves    maximum production with the resources it uses.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The maximum possible productivity of a production    unit using a specific input combination and production technology is defined    as its production frontier. However, not all enterprises present the same efficiency    in the transformation of inputs into products, which permits the possibility    of less efficient enterprises. Some authors consider that a production unit’s    distance below the production frontier as an inefficiency measure.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>2.2 Empiric model of the frontier function</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Efficiency studies that begin with an estimate    of the production function, especially the production frontier function, are    becoming more accepted and more sophisticated. Bravo-Ureta and Rieger (1990)    measured the economic efficiency of dairy production of many farms in the United    States. Ali and Chaudhry (1990) analyzed production efficiency in different    Pakistani agricultural regions. Neff, Garcia and Nelson (1993) estimated the    technical efficiency of a group of grain producers in the state of Illinois,    United States. Bravo-Ureta and Pinheiro (1997) estimated the technical, allocational,    and economic efficiency of small agricultural producers in the Dominican Republic’s,    Dajabon region.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Brazil, Tupy (1996) estimated the economic    efficiency of a sample of poultry producers. Ferreira (1998), by means of a    homotetic-ray function, analyzed the efficiency and the scale economies of poultry    production in Minas Gerais. Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o (1998) estimated the technical    efficiency of a sample of producers representative of Brazilian commercial agriculture.    Ferreira, Becker, and Waquil (1999) analyzed the technical efficiency of rural    establishments that have dairy production as their main activity. Gomes and    Alves (2000) measured the technical efficiency of a sample of dairy producers    from the states of Minas Gerais and S&atilde;o Paulo.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The production frontier function used in this    study is obtained from a homotetic-ray frontier function, which allows variable    returns to the producer’s scale. The function coefficients were estimated using    the Ordinary Least Square method (OLS) and are based on the usual suppositions    regarding error term and model specifications. Factors that effectively participate    in the soybean production process were used as explanatory variables.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The empiric model of the production frontier    function adjusted in this study can be specified as:</font></p> <table width="100%" align=center>   <tr>      <td width=95% align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n1/a03fr02.gif"></td>     <td wifth=5% align="right"><font face="Verdana" size="2">(2)</font></td>   </tr> </table>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">being:</font></p> <table width="100%" align=center>   <tr>      <td width=95% align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n1/a03fr03.gif"></td>     <td wifth=5% align="right">            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">(3</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">)</font></p>     </td>   </tr> </table>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">being that Y is the value of soybean production;    T’lnT is the cost of land weighed by its participation in total cost; M’lnM    is the cost of machinery and equipment including depreciation, maintenance,    and other use costs weighed by its participation in total cost; S’lnS is the    expense for seed weighed by its participation in the total cost; I’lnI is the    expense for fertilizers and pesticides weighed by its participation in the total    cost; O’lnO the stable and eventual labor expense weighted by its participation    in total cost; <font face="Symbol">b</font><SUB>0</SUB> = lnA and <font face="Symbol">e</font>*    = ln <font face="Symbol">e</font>= E(ln<font face="Symbol">e</font>), so that    the property of the error term maintains an average equal to zero.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The model’s variables were estimated as follows:</font></p> <OL TYPE="a"><font face="Verdana" size="2">       <LI>          <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">production value (Y) – defined by the sum        of the quantity of soybeans produced on the property multiplied by the respective        unitary price in Brazilian <I>reais</I> paid in the studied region;</font></p>   </LI>       ]]></body>

Large properties predominate in the state’s north, and small and medium    size properties predominate in its south.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The following statistical criteria were among    those used when calculating the equations through OLS: the adjustment degrees    measured by the coefficient of determination (R<SUP>2</SUP>) and the coefficient    of determination corrected for degrees of freedom (<IMG SRC="/img/revistas/resr/v41n1/Image140.gif" align="absbottom"><SUP>2</SUP>);    the significance of each equation’s regression parameter estimations (Student’s    &quot;t&quot; test ), and the significance of the regression equation (test    &quot;F&quot;).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The statistical selection criteria, the regression    coefficient signals’ coherence with economic principles, and the importance    of each variable in the productive process were observed for inconsistencies.    Knowing that highly correlated explicative variables may cause multi-colinearity    problems, we examined these variables using correlation coefficient calculus.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following the same procedure adopted by Ferreira    (1998) and Gomes (1999), we considered that the soybean producer was economically    efficient if the economic efficiency (E<SUB>E</SUB>) measurement was between    0.9 and 1. The .1 interval was intended to allow for data collecting errors.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the standard residue matrix, the production    frontier of each region and of the state was measured. To construct the probabilistic    frontier, the highest residual standard value was added to the functions estimated    by the OLS for each adopted criterion. After the estimation of each production    frontier, economic efficiency (E<SUB>E</SUB>) levels were calculated. Economic    efficiency was related with each observation, as shown in expression (5).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In this study, the stratification of efficiency    levels with 0.09 intervals was used in the result presentations. This stratification    was based on similar studies conducted by Ferreira (1998) and Gomes (1999).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>2.3 Study area and source of data</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This study includes the main soybean producing    counties in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil: Dourados, Itapor&atilde;, Laguna Carap&atilde;,    Ponta Por&atilde;, Amambai, Aral Moreira, Rio Brilhante, Maracaju, Sidrol&acirc;ndia,    S&atilde;o Gabriel do Oeste, Costa Rica and Chapad&atilde;o do Sul.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The data were collected directly from the state’s    soybean producers by means of structured and semi-structured questionnaires.    This survey was realized by a group of researchers from Embrapa Pecu&aacute;ria    Oeste, Dourados–MS, from October 1996 to September 1997. The sample was made    up of 151 soybean producers that conducted their activities as entrepreneurs    and used &quot;cr&eacute;dito rural&quot; to finance their agricultural activities.    The 151 producers were selected at random with each county contributing approximately    10% of the total number. The producers were considered by producing region (north    or south) and the state as a whole.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>3. Results and Discussion</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>3.1. Characterization of the interviewed soybean    producers</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most of the interviewed soybean producers, 72.85%,    were from the state’s south region. They controlled 50.13% of the total soybean    production area included in our study and each cultivated 262.98 ha on average.    The state’s north contains 27.15% of the interviewed soybean producers. These    producers control 49.87% of the soybean production area addressed by our study    soybean producing area and each cultivates 701.78 ha on average. As these data    indicate, Mato Grosso do Sul’s small and medium sized soybean properties are    located in the state’s south while large properties with large areas under soybean    cultivation predominate in the state’s north (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).    </font></p>     <p><a name="tab1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n1/p03t01.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>3.2 Production frontier function for the soybean    producing areas</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the production frontier function for the    regions of Mato Grosso do Sul was estimated, the coefficients of determination    (R<SUP>2</SUP>) were 0.9786 for the south region, 0.9905 for the north region,    and 0.9834 for the state. This means that 97.86%, 99.05% and 98.34% of the observed    soybean production value variations are explained by the production factors    considered for the north and south producing regions and for the entire state    respectively The corrected coefficients of determination (<IMG SRC="/img/revistas/resr/v41n1/Image140.gif" align="absbottom"><SUP>2</SUP>)    were 0.9776, 0.9891, and 0.9828 respectively (<a href="#tab3">Table 2</a>).</font></p>     <p><a name="tab2"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n1/p03t02.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the analysis of the set of explicative variables,    the F value was significant at 1% in all the three estimates. This demonstrates    that land cost (T’lnT), machinery and equipment cost (M’lnM), seed cost (S’lnS),    chemical inputs cost (I’lnI), and operational service costs (O’lnO) significantly    influence the values observed for soybean production in the state and the two    regions</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The land cost (T’lnT) variable in the south region    and state estimations had a negative coefficient, indicating that as more land    is opened for soybean cultivation, total production value decreases. This may    be related to the extensive utilization of this factor by these sample producers.    Although land use was found to be a statistically significant variable in the    determination of economic efficiency, this result implies that less land can    be cultivated with soybeans without compromising economic return in the state    as a whole or in its south region.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Verifying the soybean production frontier function    of the south region and of the state, the significance level of the production    explicative variables was inferior to 1%. This highlights these variables’ degree    of importance to the value of soybean production in the south region and the    entire state (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the north region, the test t indicates that    the costs of land (T’lnT) and seed (S’lnS) were not significant while machinery    and equipment costs (M’lnM), chemical input cost (I’lnI), and operational service    costs were statistically significant. This result suggests that these last three    variables are more important to the economic efficiency of soybean cultivation    than land and seed costs in the state’s north.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The t-test values and estimated coefficients    for the cost of machinery and equipment (M’lnM) and the cost of seed (S’lnS)    in the state’s north region were negative. This result indicates that these    factors are intensely used by the soybean producers. We point out that this    region is composed of large properties on which soybean cultivation is a totally    mechanized process.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>3.3 Economic efficiency per soybean producing    region</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The results from this study’s economic efficiency    estimates are summarized in <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. The mean economic efficiency    level of Mato Grosso do Sul’s soybean producers was 0.8028. The state’s north    region achieved the best efficiency level, 0.8705, while the south region’s    level was 8% lower, at 0.8059.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab3"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n1/p03t03.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For Charnes and Cooper (1990), enterprise inefficiency    consists of its failing to reach an &quot;efficiency frontier,&quot; that is,    the enterprise’s production (output) is not optimized given the productive inputs.    Thus, due to the .1 interval for data collecting errors, the average economic    inefficiency level of the soybean producers in Mato Grosso do Sul was between    0.0972 and 0.1972, that is, between 9.27% and 19.27% (0.90 – 0.8028; 1 – 0.8028).    In the north region, inefficiency was between 2.95% and 12.95%; in the south    region it was between 9.41% and 19.41%. These results indicate that to be considered    economically efficient the state’s soybean producers need to increase production    volume between 9.27% and 19.27% using the same level of inputs. To be considered    efficient, the south region’s producers should increase output from 9.41% to    19.41% using the same inputs. The north region’s producers, being nearer to    this study’s adopted production frontier, need only to increase production between    2.95% and 12.95%.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was expected that Mato Grosso do Sul’s soybean    producers would obtain better levels of economic efficiency and operate very    near or at their efficiency frontier. However, our results (<a href="#tab3">Table    3</a>) indicate that the producers are operating below optimal economic efficiency,    combining their production resources in a less than optimal manner.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We verified that none of our sample soybean producers    achieved the maximum efficiency level. A mean efficiency level of 0.8152 (0.80    –| 0.89 range) was achieved by 56.29% of the state’s soybean producers, while    the others (43.71%) achieved a mean level of 0.7868. The north region’s soybean    producers achieved a mean efficiency level of 0.8705, in the 0.80 –| 0.89 range.    In the south region, 67.27% of the studied producers are in the 0.80 –| 0.89    range with an average of 0.8155, while the others (32.73%) achieved a mean efficiency    of 0.7860.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The differences observed between the two regions    may be due to farm size, land ownership regime, labor, mechanization, management,    and/or production technology. It is important to note that small and medium    size properties with a mean area of 262.98 ha predominate in the south region    while large soybean properties with a mean area 701.78 ha predominate in the    north region. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>, we notice that    the higher frequency concentration of soybean producers in Mato Grosso do Sul    (56.29%) are in the 0.80 –| 0.89 efficiency range. Therefore, if the economic    efficiency of Mato Grosso do Sul’s soybean producers does not improve, future    growth of soybean production in the state may be negatively stimulated, as new    producers avoid cultivation of a crop with apparently low economic attractiveness.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>4. Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In general, the studied soybean producers in    Mato Grosso do Sul proved to be inefficient in the application of their productive    resources; however, those from the state’s north region were operating nearer    to the established efficiency frontier. This signalizes more favorable resource    reallocation in the north state, possibly due to the economic efficiency improvements    they have achieved through scale: the larger properties were concentrated in    the state’s north. The differences observed between regions may also be due    to land ownership regime, labor, mechanization, other technological advantages,    and/or management. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mean economic efficiency level achieved by    the studied soybean producers was 80.28%. At first glance, this level is not    low but indicates that additional productivity gain and/or production cost reduction    may be obtained through more efficient utilization of productive resources.    This would move these producers to their production frontier.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was expected that Mato Grosso do Sul’s soybean    producers would achieve better economic efficiency levels, that is, that they    would operate very close to or on the production frontier established by this    study. However, our results indicate that partial economic inefficiency in these    producers’ productive processes has limited their ability to take advantage    of available technology and obtain better economic results.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The verification of economic inefficiency among    the studied soybean producers suggests that efforts should be made to improve    performance in this segment. To be effective, these efforts will require that    the producers have complete and current technical and economic information.    If an improvement in economic efficiency does not occur, this segment’s low    economic attractiveness may lead to negative production stimulation over the    long term result.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the attempt to improve Brazilian agricultural    production, the determination of a production frontier that denotes rural agricultural    producer economic efficiency would be of great utility for rural extension services    and agricultural researchers. It would serve as a benchmark identifying those    producers that are producing efficiently and those that need assistance.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the business perspective of this study,    our results indicate that public policy in Mato Grosso do Sul should be directing    the transference of technology to the state’s soybean producers. This would    be the most effective measure that government agencies could use to improve    soybean production efficiency and insure the continued viability of this agricultural    segment in Mato Grosso do Sul. The technology to improve soybean production    efficiency is available; it just needs to be the field. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a research suggestion, we believe that an    efficiency analysis of all segments of the soybean productive chain would be    worthwhile. Thus, other instruments to estimate the cost, profit, and production    frontiers should be tested and used to measure the economic efficiency of rural    enterprises.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">ALI, M.; CHAUDHRY, M.A. Inter-regional farm efficiency    in Pakistan’s Punjab: a frontier production function study. <B>Journal of Agricultural    Economics</B>, Cambridge, v.41,n.1, p.62-74, Jan. 1990.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&#160;<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="javascript: window.open('/scielo.php?script=sci_nlinks&ref=000116&pid=S0103-2003200300010000300001&lng=','','width=640,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=1,menubar=yes,');">Links</a>&#160;]<!-- end-ref --><!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BRAVO-URETA, B.E.; PINHEIRO, E.

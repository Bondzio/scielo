The study analyses whether a new form of admittance to the University of Brasilia, the Serial Evaluation Program - SEP -, has helped minimize the reproduction of social stratification in higher education. The research was grounded in information obtained by questionnaires administered to samples of students who entered the university through the traditional examination method and by the SEP, in higher prestige departments (Law, Engineering and Medicine). Data were analyzed and compared by means of descriptive statistics. The results show that the social stratification that exists in Brazilian society is reflected in university admissions. SEP, the new form to select candidates to the university, maintains the social stratification for admittance into high prestige departments, constituting a new and quicker form of entrance for candidates belonging to the higher social strata.

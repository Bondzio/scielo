The focus in one hand is on the amalgam between social notoriety (genealogic, family, professional, intellectual) and political reputation (assignments, jobs, leaderships, attributes and deeds), on the other hand, the tensions arising from inherited responsibilities, the division of family&#8217;s political work, the enrollment in various fields, the compatibility of different grammars, among others. From the biographical and autobiographical production on the character are explored: 1) the connections between the &#8220;vocation&#8221; to represent (in the various meanings of the expression) and the &#8220;art&#8221; of writing, 2) the social, ideological and political uses of the collective credit production work over a political personality; 3) the management of his own image and native theorizing about political profession present in the memories of a politician. The treatment of these dimensions reveals the outlines of a mosaic of legitimate competencies for political and intellectual consecration.

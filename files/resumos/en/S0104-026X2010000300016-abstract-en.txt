This work analyzes how the quilombola women of the Guapor√© Valley, through their daily activities and their ways of life, construct their knowledge about the environment, promoting the sustainable development. The discussion related to the construction of women's knowledge about the forest and the rivers will be done through dialogues contained in interviews describing their experiences within the forest as rubber extractors, nut collectors, fishers, and healers, revealing how they use natural resources, preserving the environment.

The Uruguayan political left, embodied as the current Frente Amplio, has created an important political space for the recovery of the country&#8217;s historical &#8220;institutional matrix&#8221;. Based on this consideration, it is possible to understand it as a political space that has given continuity to the main efforts regarding the economic modernization and the establishment of the State, developed in the country by the historical Colorado Party since the beginning of the 20th century. This seems to be its main contribution to the process of the country&#8217;s political redemocratization, soon after the civic-military governments from the 1970s and 1980s. What is presented here intends to give an answer to a question concerning the current Uruguayan citizenship: can the current Frente Amplio be seen as the Colorado Party of the 21st century?

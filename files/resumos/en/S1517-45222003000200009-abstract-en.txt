The institutional crisis in Argentina in December 19-20, 2001 was preceded by a decade of social protests. Differently from other times, during those years the actions were gradually spread all over the country's territory, integrating new subjects, a new protest repertoire, new aesthetics and new demands. This work approaches such change processes in Argentina within great changes in Latin America seen both from institutional orders and from social resistance and movements in which the rural worlds were significant scenarios. Both new-type governments - which insist in keeping neoliberal policies - and movements of peasants, natives and those who demand the preservation of natural resources, are building scenarios that challenge us to think of new ruralities and reflect about the conceptual tools we should use to approach all those processes. The case of changes in Argentinean agriculture is the proper scenario to understand multiple resistance by actors in "rururban" spaces (agrarian worlds and small towns). Based on whole-country data, the several collective actions carried out in 1999 are shown and a deeper reflection is made on some struggles. The final reflections attempt to articulate social protests in the 1990s in Argentina and the 2001 rebellions as well as later crises. We also resume the idea that rural sociology has to assume and move reflectively on such transition moments - both socioculturally and epistemologically.

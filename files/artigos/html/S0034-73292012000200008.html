This way, how can we characterize a   zone that, in spite of its flourishing democracy and dense economic ties,   remain involved in territorial disputes for whose resolution the use of force   has not yet been discarded? This article contends that existing classifications   of zones of peace are not adequate to explain this unusual coexistence. Thus,   its main purpose is to develop a new analytical category of regional peace for   assessing this phenomenon: the hybrid peace. It aims to research the evolution   of security systems in South America during the previous century and build a   new, threefold classification of peace zones: negative peace zones, hybrid   peace zones, and positive peace zones.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Keywords:</b> democracy; hybrid peace; South America; zones of peace. </font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">O fato de os pa&iacute;ses   sul-americanos possu&iacute;rem regimes predominantemente democr&aacute;ticos e apresentarem   uma interdepend&ecirc;ncia cada vez maior n&atilde;o evitou que houvesse tens&otilde;es militares   entre Col&ocirc;mbia e Venezuela ou que ressurgissem conflitos de fronteira entre   Chile e Peru.

Every country in this region is democratic and economic growth has   averaged 5.5% from 2003 through 2008. This unprecedented regional scenario   stands in stark contrasts to the recent past of military regimes, chronic   economic crisis, and widespread social exclusion. Until the 1980s, every single   Latin American country faced unresolved border disputes which often triggered   militarized crises and war preparations (Holsti 1996, 150-157; Kacowicz 1998,   67-89; Miller 2007, 317-336).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> Notwithstanding, regional peace   prevailed in virtue of a normative consensus among countries for the peaceful   settlement of disputes (Kacowicz 2005, 71-124). Regional peace was much   improved by the 1980s democratization process, which allowed South American   countries, particularly in the Southern Cone, to peacefully resolve their   still-pending boundary disputes and to increase political, economic, and   military cooperation (Kacowicz 1998, 81-83). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, it is remarkable the resilience of the   past as there has been an increase in interstate tensions involving both Andean   and Southern Cone nations over the last five years. For instance, Colombia,   Ecuador and Venezuela have been involved in mutual confrontations which have   escalated to the point of threat of armed conflict, the break of diplomatic   relations and even the mobilization of troops to bordering areas (McDermott   2009). In addition, the Southern Cone has also been involved in interstate   disputes, as showcased by the renewed quarrel over the demarcation of maritime   boundaries between Chile and Peru in 2005 (Horna 2009). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This way, how can we define a region that, in spite of   its flourishing democracy and deep economic ties, remains involved in boundary   disputes for whose resolution the use of force has not yet been discarded?   Conventional approaches to zones of peace are based on the traditional, broad   classification of areas of negative and positive peace (Galtung 1975). This   dichotomous classification has been subsequently reformulated to better capture   different gradations of negative and positive peace (Holsti 1996, 157-158;   Kacowicz 1998, 8-11; Miller 2007, 44-48; Oelsner 2007, 263-265). Essentially,   the main criterion for distinguishing between zones of negative and of positive   peace is the possibility of the use of force by states (Miller 2007, 42-43).   Normally, traditional classifications of zones of peace contemplated two main   situations regarding the regional use of force. While in zones of negative   peace the use of force is possible and, depending on the gradation of the   negative peace, even imminent, in zones of positive peace, the use of force is   very unlikely. Regions of negative peace are characterized by distrust, arms   races, and military competition. Under negative peace there are preparations   and contingency plans for war. Furthermore, these zones are characterized by   the predominance of nondemocratic regimes and by a low level of economic   relations (Martin 2006, 124-144). Even though peace has still been maintained   in that kind of context, its quality has been actually low, since war has never   been completely ruled out (Kacowicz 1998, 67-81). Conversely, zones of positive   peace are defined by the presence of confidence and trust. States do not   prepare for an armed conflict with neighboring countries, nor do they expect   other states in the zone to do so. This context is mostly associated by the   presence of democratic rule and strong economic relations between countries   (Doyle 1997; Oneal and Russett 1997). Although the impact of democracy and   economic relations on the emergence of a zone of positive peace is still   unclear, the presence of these two factors has had a positive impact on the   quality of the peace, making these zones free from the use of force (Kacowicz   1998, 98-99).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This article contends that the resurgence of   interstate disputes in the region poses an important challenge to mainstream   literature which understands zones of peace largely in dichotomous terms.   Certainly, the dichotomous classification - and its subsequent reformulations -   has limitations when explaining this coexistence of factors. In other words,   the concepts of positive and negative peace are not accurate enough for   describing the foundations of the zone of peace, particularly in the Andean   sub-region of South America. To characterize the latter as a zone of positive   peace entails a major shortcoming, since in the areas of positive peace the   threat, display, or use of force is ruled out as a mean to resolve disputes   between states. The latter does not seem to be the case in this region, where   Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela experienced many militarized crises during the   last years. Likewise, it would be inaccurate to define this region as a zone of   negative peace, because democracy and strong economic relations, which are   variables generally not present in zones of negative peace, have contributed   decisively to improving the quality of peace in the Andean area by making war   and other kinds of armed conflict very unlikely. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this sense, the main limitation of these   conceptualizations is that the criterion "possibility of use of force,"   although useful to differentiate zones of negative peace from zones of positive   peace, cannot account for a "third" situation: for those zones where the use of   force is not discharged by states to resolve disputes (as in the zones of   negative peace), but where the <i>actual</i> use of force is very unlikely (as in zones of positive peace). This particular   coexistence of factors cannot be properly accounted by the dual character of   the "use of force" standard used by mainstream views on zones of peace. Since   they have established only two possibilities, the use of force is still   possible in zones of negative peace and unlikely in positive ones. This dual   criterion cannot explain the enduring overlap of militarized crises and peace.   In order to clarify this singular blend of factors, a more detailed   classification of the full spectrum of "uses of force," which is possible to   expect between states, is needed. A more nuanced conceptualization of the   varieties of the "use of force," going beyond the dual norm, would be crucial   to establish an extended categorization of zones of peace, which could account   for the security dynamics in that third situation common to the Andean region. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main purpose of this article is to address this   conceptual vacuum by way of developing a new analytical category of regional   peace: the hybrid peace. Hybrid peace refers to the coexistence between key   dimensions of both negative and positive peace. It is due to this coexistence   that the security dynamics of hybrid peace are conceptually different from   those found in zones of negative peace or positive peace. For instance, while   war is not improbable in zones of negative peace, it is very unlikely in zones   of both positive and hybrid peace. However, the factor that distinguishes the   latter zones from the ones of positive peace is the possibility to expect the   occurrence of militarized crises, since disputes have not yet disappeared from   zones of hybrid peace. The type of force expected in these zones is related to   their peace foundations. In this way, hybrid zones exist because of the   persistence of unresolved disputes in the context of democratic renaissance,   growing economic relations and a renovated set of regional institutions for the   peaceful settlement of disputes. These peace foundations account for   distinctive security dynamics that consist in the event of militarized crises   contained by the restricting effect of the above-mentioned conditions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The structure of the article follows logically from   the preceding argument. The first section provides a review of the traditional   approaches to the South American peace zone and its shortcomings to explain the   current condition of the security in the region. The second part will identify   the main dimensions involved in the classification of zones of peace in order   to introduce the concept of hybrid peace. The final part will examine the   evolution of security in South America during the previous century, taking into   account the newly-introduced typology of peace zones: negative, hybrid, and   positive. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Approaches to regional peace</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The study of peace zones in South America emerged in   the early 1990s and was largely influenced by the traditional distinction   between zones of negative and positive peace. The first authors to analyze this   region based on this perspective were Holsti (1996) and Kacowicz (1998). This   dichotomous classification has been progressively expanded in order to capture   historical and contemporary variations of peace in different regions (Holsti   1996, 157-161; Kacowicz 1998, 29-65; Miller 2007, 41-48; Oelsner 2007, 262-265)   (see <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>). For instance, Holsti defines South America as a non-war zone or   as a negative peace for most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Holsti 1996, 157).   Similarly, Kacowicz agrees with the concept of negative peace, yet derives two   subtypes from the positive peace type, that is, the stable peace and the   security community (Kacowicz 1998, 60). Finally, more recent studies have   developed a newly-expanded typology. Miller provides a further analytical   division of positive peace (normal peace and high-level peace), whereas in the   case of the negative peace he suggests the types of cold war and cold peace   (Miller 2007, 44-47). Oelsner divides negative peace into fragile, unstable,   cold, or conditional peace; and derives stable peace and security community   from positive peace (Oelsner 2007, 263-264). </font></p>       <p><a name="tab01" id="tab01"></a></p>       <p>&nbsp;</p>       <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rbpi/v55n2/a08tab01.jpg"></p>       <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main criterion used by those authors for   distinguishing among types of positive and negative peace is the likelihood in   the use of force to resolve interstate disputes. For example, the concept of   cold peace (a negative peace subcategory for Miller and Oelsner, which is the   closest to the positive peace) is defined as a situation in which states have   not yet ruled out the possibility of using force against neighbors.   Consequently, military planning and weapons acquisitions continue to be driven   by the potentiality of a war with neighbors (Oelsner 2007, 264; Miller 2007,   45-46). In this sense, the main distinction between cold peace and the other   subtypes of negative peace is that the security dilemma is more intense in the   latter case - either because states have recently been at war, or because   the imminence of war is far more acute than in cases of cold peace. Yet, war   has not been ruled out completely within the category of cold peace. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the idea of an emerging security community,   or of stable peace, is a close depiction of the Southern Cone peace zone   (Hurrell 1998, 137-154), it would not be accurate to include the Andean region   in such a type, since their countries maintain border disputes, have broken   diplomatic relations and still maintain conflict scenarios with their   neighbors. Nevertheless, defining the Andean region as a zone of negative peace   underestimates the impact of democracy, strong economic relations, and a   normative consensus for the peaceful settlement of disputes, on the likelihood   of the use of force against neighboring countries. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These conceptualizations' main drawback is that the   values of the criterion "possibility of use of force" (imminent/likely for the   case of negative peace and unlikely/very unlikely for the case of positive   peace) cannot account for those situations where states do not discharge the   use of force to resolve disputes; but where the effective use of force is unlikely   or, more precisely, only limited to the threat or display of military force.   This lack of complexity for distinguishing zones of peace underestimates the   positive impact that democracy, economic relations, and regional institutions   have on the possibility of the use of force by states.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In other words, the Andean region's categorization as   a zone of negative peace minimizes the crucial impact that democracy, economic   relations, and institutions have in restricting the use of force, exclusively,   for militarized crises. In this sense, the incorporation of a third category of   peace, the hybrid one, would require an expanded conceptualization of the   criterion "use of force." This clarification should include not only a   classification of the different uses of force expected between states, but also   an analysis on how they are related to different peace foundations. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A widely well-known classification of conflict between   states is the Armed Conflict Dataset of the Uppsala Conflict Data Program. This   dataset distinguishes between three types of conflicts - war, intermediate   armed conflict, and minor armed conflict. "War" involves at least   1,000 battle-related deaths per year; "intermediate conflict" has between   25 and 1,000 deaths per year and a cumulative total for the entire   conflict of at least 1,000 deaths, but fewer than 1,000 in any given year;   and "minor armed conflict" has at least 25 deaths per year and fewer than   1,000 deaths accumulated during the course of the conflict. The   incorporation of the category "militarized interstate crisis" to this   classification is relevant since the logic of the use of force in zones of   hybrid peace is usually restricted to that kind of dynamics. Militarized   interstate disputes are "cases of conflict in which the threat, display or use   of military force short of war by one member state is explicitly directed   towards the government, official representatives, official forces, property, or   territory of another state. Disputes are composed of incidents that range in   intensity from threats to use of force to actual combat short of war" (Jones   1996). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The expected level of conflict in zones of peace is   related to their foundations. Zones of negative peace are featured by weak   peace foundations, which make the use of military force in their entire   spectrum from war to militarized crisis more likely. Conversely, the   foundations of zones of positive peace encourage a peaceful settlement of   disputes. In zones of hybrid peace, countries do not discard the possibility of   a military conflict, the political discourse can be belligerent, force can be   displayed via troops mobilization to borders, and arms purchases are made based   on a possible confrontation with neighboring countries (Hirst 2003; Kahhat   2008). Although neither diplomatic crisis nor permanent references to the   possibility of war can be dismissed, in these zones countries never resort to   war or to an intermediate/minor armed conflict to resolve a dispute (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>)   since democracy, economic relations, and regional institutions limit that   possibility. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The foundations of peace zones </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conditions that encourage or prevent the use of force   among states in a given region have been extensively studied by the zones of   peace approach. Although realism and liberalism have their own explanations on   the sources of peace and conflict, some authors have argued that the   combination of both theories is a promising way to deal with peace foundations   (Kacowicz 1998; Miller 2007). In this way, these authors dismiss both realist   and liberal approaches as they considered them ill-suited to account for the   persistence of peace in South America. Kacowicz argues that "conventional   theories of international relations do not provide a comprehensive explanation   for the phenomenon of peace zones" (1998, 2). Miller contented that traditional   approaches could be worked in tandem for explaining the different gradations of   regional peace. For instance, the presence of realist variables (such as   balance of power strategies or the persistence of territorial or ideological   conflicts) and the absence of those linked to liberalism (democratic regimes,   high levels of commercial trade, or regional institutions to process conflicts)   are generally associated with zones of negative peace (Miller 2007, 21-23).   This approach would be used to connect five different types of peace   foundations with different uses of force expected in each zone of peace (<a href="#tab02">Table 2</a>).</font></p>       <p><a name="tab02" id="tab02"></a></p>       <p>&nbsp;</p>       <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rbpi/v55n2/a08tab02.jpg"></p>       <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Satisfaction   with the status quo</i>: the satisfaction with the status quo refers to   the degree of agreement that the states have toward the set of diplomatic,   political, military, and economic rules that govern a system or subsystem. The   existence of unresolved territorial or ideological disputes between states is   usually referred as the most important source of state dissatisfaction with the   status quo. Satisfaction is <i>passive</i> when there are unresolved territorial conflicts or disagreement over the rules   governing the system. Satisfaction that comes from passivity is common in situations   of negative or hybrid peace. States are <i>actively</i> satisfied with the status quo when there are no territorial or ideological   disputes or, if they exist, they are irrelevant to interstate relations. When   satisfaction is active, countries would not militarize their bilateral   relations. Positive peace, or any of its subcategories, only exists when all   states are actively satisfied with the status quo     (Kacowicz 1998, 47-50).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Security   dynamics</i>: it refers to the predominant interaction between states in   the area of military security (Buzan, Waever, and De Wilde 1998, 49-70). In   zones of negative peace, states are normally immersed in a logic of "internal   or external balance of power," that is, when they attempt to maintain, via   domestic buildup or external alliances, their relative military capabilities   vis-&agrave;-vis other states. Military competence or the outbreak of arms races is   common in those cases. In zones of hybrid peace, on the contrary, states opt   for "general deterrence" as their principal defense strategy. It refers to a   policy of regulating an adversarial relationship between two states through the   maintenance of a satisfactory level of forces aimed at raising the cost of an   eventual military aggression from a neighboring country. This kind of strategy   is implemented when state actors perceive that war is unlikely and,   consequently, the maintenance of a classic balance of military power is not   economically feasible or worthy. Therefore, countries in zones of peace   renounce to maintain their relative military capacities vis-&agrave;-vis other states   (Schweller 2004). Finally, the main security dynamics in zones of positive   peace is <i>military     cooperation</i>. In these zones, the use of force is no longer an   option; on the contrary, military cooperation is the predominant security   relation between states. In addition, states begin to practice different forms   of military integration.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Type   of regime</i>: theories about peace zones define democracy as a factor   that improves the quality of the peace (Kacowicz 1997; Miller 2007). Some   studies focus on democratic norms and argue that a liberal democratic culture   can make leaders become used to negotiation and compromise (Russet 1993, 1996).   Additionally democracy can promote peace because democratic leaders try to   eliminate conflict hypotheses in order   to reduce domestic military power (Buzan and Weaver 2003, 325-327).   Other studies focus on political structures; democratic governments face   institutionalized constraints that hamper their capacity to mobilize the   state's resources for war without the consent of a broad number of actors   (Russett 1993, 30). A recent strand of neoclassical realism sustains that   democracy promotes peace through means not contemplated by the mainstream   literature on democratic peace. Related to this, democracy generates a wealth   of information about a state's motivations because of its transparency during   its policymaking process (Kidd 1997). This implies that if a state has peaceful   or aggressive intentions towards their neighbors, the democratic process will   reveal it. This democratic feature may contribute to an early intervention of   other states and regional institutions that will prevent conflicts from   escalating and/or appease the aggressor.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Economic   relations</i>: liberals suggest a positive link between the expansion of   economic relations between states, mainly trade and investment, and peace. A   series of works suggested that high level of commercial exchange reduces the   incidence of militarized disputes (Doyle 1997; Mansfield and Pollins 2001; Russett   and Oneal 2001). A recent strand of the interdependence approach argues that   the level of direct foreign investment between states is an important variable   to explain regional peace; the greater the volume of trade and investment   between two countries, the more interest these countries will have in avoiding   conflict (Rosecrance and Thompson 2003). The level of economic relations does   not seem to have been an important variable to explain the maintenance of   negative peace in South America, since peace persists in a context of a low   level of economic exchanges (Martin 2006). Nevertheless, the increase of both   bilateral trade and investment are factors that have contributed to the   consolidation of hybrid and positive peace zones through the formation of a dense   interrelated network of social and economic actors whose main interest is the   maintenance and expansion of economic relations, which demands a predictable   and peaceful context. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Type   of regional norms</i>: According to Kacowicz (2005, 166) "the normative   framework has been relevant in the maintenance of long peace in South America."   Norms contribute to the formation of identities and interests; the   institutionalization of these norms improves communication between states,   reducing uncertainty about intentions and increasing the capacity of   governments to make credible, binding commitments to one another (Keohane   1984). Kacowicz (2005) identified five types of international norms that have   favored regional peace in South America: 1) common interests and values,   2) sovereignty and equality of states, 3) <i>uti possidetis</i> and territorial integrity,   4) peaceful settlement of international disputes, and 5) arms   control, collective security, and Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs). In Latin   America, these rules "have been formalized in an intricate network of formal   institutions that have regulated the relations of Latin American nations"   (Kacowicz 2005, 63). Negative peace has persisted in South America due to the   pacifying effect that this set of rules has had over the behavior of states. In   the past 20 years, the amount of norms in this region has expanded   considerably, especially those related to the peaceful settlement of   international disputes and those who foster the building of regional defense   institutions. The presence of new regional institutions and their capacity to   prevent and resolve interstate disputes is a distinguishing feature of hybrid   peace zones and of positive peace ones.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although zones of negative peace were maintained in   South America despite the absence of democracy during most part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, its rapid diffusion in the 1980s substantially improved the quality of   peace (Kacowicz 1998, 2005). It is precisely for this reason that democracy is   a variable that contributes to explain the consolidation of hybrid and positive   peace zones. Certainly, positive peace has lasted in the Southern Cone because   democratic regimes have been able to settle border disputes. However, zones of   hybrid peace show that territorial or ideological disputes endure, even in a   militarized fashion, but that the actual use of military force is unlikely to   resolve it. Democracy does not necessarily guarantee the resolution of boundary   issues, but it does reveal state's intentions and it certainly encourages   governments to support new regional institutions of conflict resolution while   forcing leaders to be more sensitive to the interests of both citizens and   economic groups, which are increasingly favored by the expansion of trade and   investment relations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the South American zone of negative peace, armed   conflict was usually a possible alternative and, in many cases, it was even   imminent when it came to resolving conflicts. Regional peace was maintained   mainly by the presence of norms of peaceful settlement of disputes (Kacowicz   1998, 2005). Admittedly, peace prevailed during most part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in spite of the poor economic relations or the complete absence of   these among states and despite the predominance of nondemocratic rules (Martin   2006, 117-148). The existence of unresolved disputes favored the maintenance of   conflict hypotheses and of military deployment oriented to an eventual war with   neighboring countries.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the hybrid zone of peace, states uphold different   kinds of territorial and ideological disputes, they may consider the   possibility of using force and they deploy and organize their armed forces'   missions in the light of a potential conflict with neighbor countries.   Militarized crises have not yet disappeared and when they break out countries   can mobilize troops to their borders and their leaders' speech can be   bellicose. Nevertheless, the use of military force in zones of hybrid peace is   unlikely. This is due to the combined effect of three factors that prevent a   military escalation from taking place. The first factor is that the   predisposition of democratic leaders towards negotiation and compromise has   favored not only the adherence to new regional institutions of conflict   settlement, but also a greater willingness to bilateral negotiation with their   neighbors. Moreover, democratic politics reveals states intentions and leaders   motivations because of the ample circulation of information about military   doctrine, deployment, and weapons acquisitions, which can foster an early   involvement of regional institutions. The second element is the increasing   level of economic relations, which strengthens the interest of domestic groups   in maintaining and deepening the status quo. Finally, the third reason is the   fact that the framework of norms that foster the preservation of peace is not   only present but its importance has been enhanced by the creation of new   political and defense regional institutions such as Union of South American   Nations (UNASUR) and the South American Defense Council (SADC). This reinforced   institutional framework contributes to build confidence and certainty, and   favors communications between governments. The interaction of these three   factors have prevented the escalation of conflicts in these zones and have   limited the use of force to the level of display of military force in the   course of a militarized crises. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The resolution of territorial or ideological disputes,   or its irrelevance in bilateral relations, is the aspect that defines the   pathway from hybrid to positive peace. In the latter, countries abandon the   idea of military conflict with their neighbors and, therefore, security   relations are no longer based on military balance or deterrence. Subsequently,   security relations start to shift towards cooperation and emerging processes of   military integration. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The prevalence of Negative Peace in South America,   1900-1980</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">South America was plagued with military conflicts   during the 19<sup>th</sup> century (Centeno 2002). However, during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the amount of wars and disputes decreased; there were only two   interstate wars, Bolivia-Paraguay in 1932-1935 and Peru-Ecuador in 1941 (Holsti   1996, 154). Since 1941 there have been no interstate wars among countries in   the region, although minor armed conflicts between Peru and Ecuador did take place   in 1981 and 1995. Nonetheless, all the countries in the region faced unresolved   territorial disputes during this period. As a result, states did not rule out   the possibility of using force against neighboring countries, revealing the   existence of an intense security dilemma. Consequently, arms races, arms   competitions, and informal alliances were common in this period (Holsti 1996,   154-157). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The scarcity of wars during the 20<sup>th</sup> century led South America to be defined as "the most peaceful region in the   world" (Holsti 1996, 155). The main cause of this "long regional peace" was the   shared normative consensus for the peaceful settlement of international   disputes that prevailed among South American nations (Kacowicz 1998, 2005).   Holsti (1996, 156) argues that "no other region of the world has as many   bilateral and multilateral documents, treaties and charters imposing   obligations for the peaceful settlement of disputes."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In spite of this normative consensus, the probability   of a war among the most powerful South American countries was not only high   but, to a large extent, imminent throughout this period. Argentina and Brazil   experienced an intense rivalry during most part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.   The competition became more intense during the Second World War, when both   countries were on the brink of a war, and later escalated during the 1960s and   1970s, when these countries were immersed in a nuclear arms race. Similarly,   Argentina and Chile sustained a prolonged border dispute that nearly provoked a   war in 1978. War was also imminent in the cases of Chile-Peru (1975),   Ecuador-Peru (1935, 1991), and Colombia-Nicaragua (1979).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critics have contended the liberal theories' arguments   on negative peace. Democracy and economic relations have been mostly absent in   South America during a great part of the 20<sup>th</sup> century yet peace   still prevailed in this region (Kacowicz 1998; Martin 2006; Dominguez 2003).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, democratization and increasing economic   relations, during the 1990s, were factors that positively contributed to the   transformation of negative zones of peace into areas of hybrid peace. Countries   of the latter zones have displayed a degree of compromise and confidence   towards their neighbors greater to the levels present in zones of negative   peace. This is because democratic leaders are both more willing to negotiate   with their counterparts and are more predisposed to create or join regional   institutions for conflict resolution. Similarly, they are also more likely to   pay attention to the voice of economic and social actors, either for economic   interests or electoral reasons, who generally favor the maintenance of peace. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Hybrid peace in South America, 1990-2010</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zones of hybrid peace are characterized by the   simultaneous presence of: 1) unresolved disputes that may become   militarized, yet without escalating to an intermediate armed conflict or war;   2) democracies that maintain dense economic relations with their neighbor   countries; and 3) regional norms and institutions (both old and new) that   help to resolve disputes peacefully. The most relevant cases of hybrid peace in   South America are Chile-Peru since 1990 and Colombia-Venezuela since 1991.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The return of full democratic regimes to the   above-mentioned countries is a key indicator of the formation of a zone of   hybrid peace. The emergence of democracy, in those countries, was linked to a   sustained increase in trade and financial relations. Both factors have enhanced   the quality of the existing peace. Trade involving Venezuela and Colombia   increased 100% between 1990 and 2000 and 300% between 2000 and 2008 (IADB   2011). Colombia is currently the second largest market for exports from   Venezuela and vice versa. Moreover, the first section of a gas pipeline, which   supplies Colombian gas to western Venezuela, was inaugurated in October 2007.   This kind of energetic interconnection suggests a long-term commitment of   governments in what concerns regional stability (Rosecrance and Thompson 2003,   384-390). Similarly, in the period 1993-2005 the total exports from Peru to the   world quadrupled. In this same period, exports to Chile increased eleven times   (Fairlie, Queija, and Rasmussen 2007, 113). Similarly, trade between Chile and   Peru rose from US$ 648 million in 2001 to US$ 2,950 million   in 2008 (IADB 2011a). Currently, Peru is the second destination of foreign   investments from Chile with an accumulated amount of   US$ 9,999 million by 2010 (Government of Chile 2011). Similarly,   Chile is the main destination of Peruvian foreign investments with an   accumulated amount of US$ 3,000 million (Peru 21 2010).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Certainly, it is possible to expect an increase in the   trade between both Chile-Peru and Colombia-Venezuela due to tariff advantages,   low transportation costs and the complementary nature of their economies. This   positive expectation about future commerce is an extraordinary incentive for   keeping regional peace (Copeland 1998).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zones of hybrid peace are also characterized by a   renewed process of regional institutional building fostered by the   predisposition for negotiation by democratic regimes. In this way, the Southern   Cone has undergone a process of institutional strengthening for the prevention   and resolution of conflicts led by Brazil through initiatives such as UNASUR   and SADC. Although the mere existence of those institutions does not guarantee   the resolution of conflicts, it can contribute to the development and   institutionalization of new dynamics that facilitate their prevention and   management. The new SADC plan for the years 2010-2011 envisages different   actions for conflict prevention and for the reduction of regional uncertainty:   1) establishing a mechanism for consultation and providing instant   information about situations that put regional peace at risk;   2) developing a common methodology for measuring UNASUR defense spending;   3) devising common procedures for the implementation of   confidence-building measures (SADC 2010). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In terms of conflict management, UNASUR and the SADC   are institutional settings for regional negotiation in which members can be   quickly summoned. Additionally it has the flexibility to deal with a wide range   of defense-related issues. These features have come more apparent since the   attempt to deploy US troops in Colombian bases in March 2009. Neighboring   nations were concerned that Colombian bases would be used as a platform to   increase US military control over the region. The rest of the countries made   clear their vehement opposition to the decision of Colombia to expand   cooperation with the US. As a reaction to that future deployment, South   American Presidents and defense and foreign relations ministers quickly   cancelled prior commitments and within a few days organized two consecutive   meetings. The first in Argentina included all the UNASUR presidents, while the   second, in Ecuador, called the defense and foreign affairs ministers of the   SADC. The final document of the meeting includes a rejection of foreign   military threats to the sovereignty of the member nations. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These dynamics contributed not only to the   de-escalation of the crisis, but also to the establishment of a system of   defense consultation, discussion and negotiation, which could become precedent   in dealing with crises to come. UNASUR and SADC intervention was critical for   the release of the secret agreement that Colombia had signed with its northern   partner affording the later use of its bases. The disclosure of the agreement   considerably reduced the level of regional tension since it revealed that the   US troops would not be operating outside of Colombia. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, the process of democratization, the growing   economic relations, and the regional institutional framework have failed to   resolve territorial disputes or to dismiss the organization and deployment of   the armed forces in the light of a potential military conflict with neighbor   countries. Nonetheless, the presence of these factors should not be neglected   since their existence and interaction can prevent armed conflicts and limit the   escalation of militarized crises in at least two different ways. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, democratic leaders are more inclined both to   negotiate with counterparts and to accept and participate in regional   institutions, which are key actors for resolving conflicts. As a case in point,   South American leaders have established, for the first time in its history, a   regional institution (UNASUR) that plays a crucial role in de-escalation of the   frequent crises between Colombia and Venezuela/Ecuador. Leaders' predisposition   to negotiation was demonstrated in the various crises faced by Colombia and   Venezuela. The bellicose rhetoric that the presidents showed during the various   crises was promptly followed by a natural willingness to negotiate. The latest   crisis broke out in July 2010 when President Uribe denounced the presence of   camps of Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia   (FARC), the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, on Venezuelan soil. After a   few days of diplomatic skirmishes, the UNASUR intervened successfully. On July   22, the president of both countries signed the Declaration of Santa Marta in   which they promised to "re-launch bilateral relations restoring diplomatic   relations between both countries based on a transparent and direct dialogue,   favoring diplomatic pathways" (Smink 2010). Similarly, democratic leaders'   predisposition to negotiation is also confirmed by the Chile and Peru decisions   to submit their maritime dispute to the International Court of Justice in The   Hague. Both countries declared that they are willing to accept the Court's   ruling regardless of its outcome (Salazar 2010).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Secondly, democracy favors hybrid peace because it   reveals the military intentions of neighboring states. In particular, the   electoral process, and the interaction between the executive and legislative   and bureaucratic politics can disclose plenty of information about the military   posture of a state (Kydd 1997, 128-139). In other words, in a democracy, it is   difficult to hide preparations for a military action because the democratic   process would reveal it. Certainly, there is no guarantee that a democracy will   always have peaceful intentions. But even in the worst-case scenario, the main   effect of this kind of regime would be to act as an early prevention mechanism   that will foster the intervention of regional institutions to impede the   conflict outbreak or its escalation. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hybrid peace's conditions not only limit the   escalation of militarized crisis, but also restrict defense relations   exclusively to the realm of general deterrence. This kind of strategy has been   implemented by South American countries such as Colombia or Peru since they   have not balanced the weapons acquisitions of Venezuela and Chile. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chilean purchases triple those of Peru. Furthermore,   the type of weaponry incorporated by Chile gives this country a clear relative   military advantage over Peru. Chile acquired 316 Leopard tanks,   2 submarines, 8 frigates, and 42 F-16 fighter jets. Peru's   response to Chile's purchases was the acquisition of two used frigates from   Italy, the modernization of its military aircraft, and the acquisition of   anti-tank missiles. The same pattern can be observed in the case of Colombia   and Venezuela. Venezuela's purchase of 24 Su-30 aircraft and   last-generation missiles and submarines did not provoke an equivalent response   of Colombia, who decided to buy used Kfir aircraft adapted for counter-insurgency   missions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This lack of response by Peru and Colombia, vis-&agrave;-vis   the significant weapon acquisitions of Chile and Venezuela, reveals that   changes in relative military capacities are no longer perceived as a security   problem in zones of hybrid peace. However, the fact that the acquisition of   Chile and Venezuela did not provoke any equivalent response from Peru and   Colombia should not be perceived as an indicator of these countries accepting   their military weakness, but rather as a rational response to a regional   context in which war, and intermediate and minor armed conflicts are unlikely.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The emergence of positive peace</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The evolution of positive peace in the Southern Cone   has had three main phases. During the first one, states launched a process of   negotiation to resolve boundary disputes. The second was primarily economic and   was characterized by the signature of trade agreements and the substantial   increase in economic relations, especially in trade and investment. Finally,   states began a process of military cooperation that eventually led to the   elimination of conflict hypotheses.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The positive peace zone began to take shape in the   Southern Cone when Argentina, Brazil, and Chile resolved their border disputes   (Buzan and Weaver 2003, 322-327). The return of democracy in the mid-1980s   fostered and strengthened the process of cooperation between Argentina and   Brazil (Kacowicz 1998, 81-89, 117-121). Relations between Argentina and Chile   followed a similar path. The resolution of the pending border issues fosters a   significant increase in economic relations (Fuentes 1996). Trade between the   two countries grew systematically after the treaty was signed in 1984.   Argentina became the main destination for foreign investment from Chile with a   total amount of US$ 15,900 million between 1990 and 2010. This   represents 28% of Chile's total investments abroad (Government of Chile 2011a). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The positive foundations of peace in the Southern Cone   became evident with the so-called "gas crisis" of 2004, when Argentina had to   cut down its gas shipments to Chile. In some months, the shipments were reduced   to almost zero because Argentina privileged the supply of gas to its own   growing domestic demand. This affected significantly the activity level of   Chile's economy, heavily dependent on Argentinean gas. However, the conflict   was negotiated and resolved in a political way; relations between both   countries were not altered and militarized discourse, common in the recent past   and foreseeable for the kind of issue at stake, was absent during the entire   crisis.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a matter of fact, security relations between   countries in the Southern Cone have improved substantially since the 1980s.   Democracy has had a favorable impact on the security situation in this zone.   The challenges faced by new democracies in Argentina (1983) and in Brazil   (1985) contributed to creating a sense of common vulnerability, especially in   regard to the power of the armed forces (Buzan and Weaver 2003, 325). Both   countries used to maintain reciprocal conflict hypothesis by the mid-1980s,   which was seen by the newly-democratic authorities as a source of domestic and   economic power for the military. In this sense, the deepening of economic,   political, and military relations were perceived by the democratic leaders as a   strategy to reduce military power and assert civilian control. In this way,   Argentina eliminated its conflict hypothesis with Brazil at the end of the   1980s and Brazil followed that measure in 1996, beginning a process of   relocation of military units from its Argentinean border to the Amazon (Zirker   and Martins 2000). In this connection, the CBMs, such as joint maneuvers or   officer exchanges, have increased considerably since 1995. Moreover, Argentina   and Brazil established the Argentine-Brazilian Mechanism for Coordination of   Security and Defense (MCSD). The MCSD is a forum for policy coordination on   security matters which includes a Mechanism of Strategic Analysis whereby   national agendas of international security are put forth and debated (Flemes 2005). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Relations between Argentina and Chile also experienced   significant progress in the realm of defense. Between 2002 and 2008,   45 joint military exercises were carried out. In 2001, both states   developed a common methodology to measure defense expenditures with support   from the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA). This initiative was   unprecedented worldwide and it had a great impact at the regional level. In   what concerns the bilateral level, there is a mechanism of annual conferences   between the ministers of defense and foreign affairs of Chile and Argentina. It   is also important to consider the experience of the Standing Committee on   Security. This committee was founded in 1996 and is composed of senior   officials from the ministries of defense and foreign affairs who have held two   meetings per year since it was first launched (Flemes 2005). The natural   consequence of this military relation was the creation of a binational force:   the Cruz del Sur (Southern Cross), which has 1,500 troops participating in   United Nations peacekeeping missions (Briones and Alvarez 2008).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The resolution of the main border conflicts, the   increasing level of economic exchange, the impact of democracy on   civil-military relations, and the presence of new regional institutions for   resolving conflicts contribute to create a context where militarized crises or   the use of force are unlikely - in other words, a zone of positive peace. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Concluding remarks </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Interstate disputes have returned to South America.   However, the regional context of this new generation of boundary disputes is   very different from the one that existed when negative peace prevailed. In that   period, the only limit to military escalation was the presence of a tradition   of peaceful settlement of disputes. In zones of hybrid peace the limits have   increased. Democracy has fostered the creation and support of all South   American countries to new regional institutions of conflict resolution such as   UNASUR and the SADC. Democracy has also allowed these countries to know and   understand their neighbors' intentions, especially concerning the use of force.   Furthermore, the existence of strong trade and investments relations in the   present and a high expectation of continuity in the future have strengthened   domestic groups whose main interest is the maintenance and deepening of the   status quo. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This classical triad of democracy, trade, and   institutions operates as a set of breaks that are activated when a dispute   emerges. Owing to this, they significantly raise the costs of using force. The   low probability of war in zones of positive or hybrid peace explains the lack   of interest by Peru, Colombia, or Argentina in purchasing arms in response to   the interest of their neighbors in doing so. This is a rational calculation based   on the assumption that relative military advantages cannot be exploited in such   contexts. For this reason, the phenomenon of an arms race can only take place   in a zone of negative peace, where states seek to maintain military balance   with their adversaries, where war is still likely.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The probability of the use of force in zones of   negative, hybrid, and positive peace is an indicator that the security dilemma   is not a homogeneous phenomenon. The type of peace that prevails in each region   produces different intensity in this dilemma. In areas of negative peace, the   dilemma is intense and the use of force remains an option for states. In hybrid   zones, the dilemma is moderated. Conflicts persist but the effect of the triad   gives greater certainty about the extent of the use of force. In cases of   positive peace, the security dilemma is attenuated. States have abandoned the   option of using force as a means to resolve disputes with neighboring nations.   In such cases, arms purchases, regardless of their size or destructive   potential, will not cause concern among members of the zone due to the strong   network of political, economic, and security relations that make the outbreak   of a military conflict very unlikely. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bibliographic references</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BRIONES, Briones &amp; Rodrigo &Aacute;lvarez V (2008) <i>&iquest;Construyendo   Confianzas?

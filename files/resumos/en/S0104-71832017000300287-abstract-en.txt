Abstract: In this work, I intend to evaluate the research of the students was built from the experience of teaching method adopted in the course Teaching Laboratory in Social Sciences, as they collectively operated its pragmatic interpretations of the texts adopted conforming fieldwork as interlocution experience. Also I try to analyze their influence on the construction of suffering and pain speeches, observed during the course, for students narrating experiences of physical punishment of children and their families present in the polls, the paradoxical relationship with the school, its challenges, and consequences. The question I want to answer, is the extent to which schools are able to conform meaning of codes of social life for these children without involving dramatic family costs? In this sense, we evaluate what these point of view the costs of teachers/researchers on visits to parents, the image that set the same in these tense encounters.

There is an ongoing debate on whether processes of direct democracy, such as the popular initiative, plebiscite and referendum are helpful in the political decision making process. On the one hand, there are authors arguing that these institutions slow the political game down, turn it more expensive, confusing and illegitimate; others defend the contrary position, arguing these mechanisms are fundamental to the citizen and the quality of democracy. The present study examines the following seven issues of this matter, based on theoretical consideration and empirical research: 1. Democratic minimalism and maximalism; 2. Competition between majority and minority; 3. Competition between representative institutions and processes of direct democracy. 4. Competence of citizens; 5. Side effects of processes of direct democracy; 6. Size of electorate; 7. Costs of processes of direct democracy. The analysis is based on a review of national and international literature. The study shows that processes of direct democracy can be complementary to institutions of representative democracy. The well functioning of popular initiatives, plebiscites and referendums does not only depend on their regulation, but also on the performance of the other political institutions as well as the socio-economical situation of a country. The study allows to deepen the debate on processes of direct democracy in Brazil.

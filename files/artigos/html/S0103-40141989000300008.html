No discussion of the weakening of the    liberal international economic order (the trend towards trade protection, chronic    instability in currency and financial markets) can disregard the extreme pressures    to export, to compress imports, and to conserve foreign exchange that shape    the economic policies of the heavily indebted LDC nations. No analysis of the    scope and limitations of monetary policy in the developed countries (and especially    in the United States) will be complete unless it takes into account the consequences    for the major banks of a sovereign debt exposure which remains even now very    large in relation to shareholders' equity, and which still frequently appears    in bank accounts at an unrealistically optimistic valuation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> However, serious literature on the debt    issue has tended to isolate specific facets of the problem, no doubt reflecting    the academic background or the policy concerns of individual authors. <i>Economists    </i>have written extensively about the "adjustment" process by which    the economies of indebted countries are expected to adapt to the abrupt reversal    of net capital flows. Some of the implication for long-run development strategy    have been studied, and a great deal has been written about short-term macro-economic    policy, especially concentrating on fiscal balance and export promotion. Much    of this literature treats the individual indebted country as the unit of analysis.    Of course international economists, also consider the 'problem of aggregation'    that arises when a large number of countries simultaneously attempt the same    policy switch (perhaps competing against each other for a relatively fixed supply    of external assistance).<a name="1not"></a><a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i>Political scientists    </i>have also contributed to the case-by-case approach, notably by discussing    the political constraints on 'adjustment' in individual countries, and sometimes    by speculating on the longer term political consequences of protracted austerity.<a name="2not"></a><a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>     Perhaps the most interesting result of their discussion has been a negative    finding  it has proved harder than expected to identify clear political constraints    to even the harshest forms of economic adjustment; there is as yet no strong    correlation between protracted austerity and political authoritarianism; popular    protest against economic hardship has been less widespread and less effective    than anyone would have dared to predict five years ago.<a name="3not"></a><a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>  But these    are very tentative results and in any case they are muffled by the intricate    particularities of each national experience.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> From the other <i>site financial analysts    </i>have examined the predicament of the creditor banks, carefully considering    not only the accounting and regulatory framework, but also the diverse interests    and rival bargaining strategies of different types of bank  large versus small;    American v. European v. Japanese; official v. commercial and so forth. Although    these writers often display a great deal of sophistication and ingenuity in    their treatment of the technical aspects of the problem, they may overstate    the scope for devising 'solution' to the underlying conflicts of interest by    resort to financial wizardy. They tend to rely on traditional banking concepts    like "insolvency versus iliquidity' which assume a framework of commercial    law that can perhaps be applied unambiguously to corporate debtors in advanced    capitalist markets, but which may obscure more than it illuminates when transferred    to the international arena and applied to sovereign debt.<a name="4not"></a><a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Some international aspects of the debt    crisis have also received considerable attention,<a name="5not"></a><a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>  although this    has been focused on a limited range of relatively precise issues especially    those of interest to policy-makers and advisers in the principal bureaucratic    agencies affected (such as the IMF, the World Bank, the Bank for International    Settlements, UNCTAD, GATT, and the UN Economic Commission for Latin America    and the Caribbean and so on).<a name="6not"></a><a href="#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>  In the first few years after the debt    crisis broke (August 1982) much of this literature rested on the assumption    that these agencies were faced with a short-term emergency. Provided the parties    concerned worked together on correctly designed remedial measures, it was assumed    that there would shortly be a return to something like the status quo ante.    The alternative was thought to be some very dramatic and destructive upheaval     a danger to be averted at all costs, but not in truth a very likely outcome    or one worthy of precise analysis. Authors working within    this framework naturally tended to exaggerate the wisdom, autonomy and leverage    of the agencies with which they were associated. Only recently has this outlook    been reconsidered as it became apparent that there was a third alternative between    the return to normalcy and a catastrophic breakdown  namely a protracted, gruelling    and inconclusive tussle between debtors and creditors, which mediating agencies    would have no more than a limited capacity to ameliorate.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Finally there have been a succession    of declaratory statements and programmatic documents, claiming to address the    many ramifications of the debt issue. The Cartagena Group of Latin American    leaders set up in 1984 has produced one set of position papers, and keynote    speeches at Annual Meeting of the Brank/Fund have summarized the 'First World'    response. Few of these statements and documents are of much lasting value. The    most celebrated initiative was the so-called "Baker Plan", launched    in an address to the September 1985 meeting of the Bank/Fund by the then US    Treasury Secretary James Baker III.<a name="7not"></a><a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a>  A brief consideration of the    Baker Plan should suffice to illustrate the limitations of all the declaratory    statements of the kind that have been made to date. Secretary Baker's speech    was regarded as a major shift of ground by the Reagan administration after three    years of 'malign neglect' under his predecessor in the Treasury Donald Regan.    The Baker Plan not only conceded many of the analytical points made by Third    World critics of the Western policy response, it also specified a new strategy    with a definite volume of additional resources to be made available for fifteen    named debtor countries within a relatively short period of time. Even those    critics who considered the whole initiative quite inadequate had to concede    that it seemed like a major step in the right direction. But unlike say the    Marshall Plan or the Alliance for Progress, the Baker Plan in fact created no    institutional framework to guarantee or even to monitor its implementation.    Three-and-a-half years later there is no objective way to assess the results    of the initiative, other than to note that the hope for 'new money' from the    commercial banks never materialized. No one can even say which of the fifteen    debtors was a beneficiary under the plan. It is thus impossible to give a rigorous    answer to such questions as 'was the Baker Plan a success?' or 'was it adequate    to the situation?' let alone 'what lessons can we draw from this experience?'    According to the circunstances almost everything that has been done for the    debtors by the West since October 1985 could be attributed to 'the Baker Plan'     or nothing.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In March 1989    Baker's successor at the US Treasury, Nicholas Brady, opened a new phase of    negotiations by conceding the need for debt reduction (not forgiveness, however).    It is too early to judge the impact of this initiative, but the Brady approach    does implicitly recognise the inadequacies of the Baker plan, and for the first    time it loosens the bonds uniting creditors into a common front.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Economists </i><b>have    written extensively about the 'adjustment' process by which the economies of    indebted countries are expected to adapt to the abrupt reversal of net capital    flows.</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> There are several    aspects of the debt issue that should be of particular interest to students    of international relations. Clearly a narrowly state-centred approach would    fail to account for the major roles played by such non-state actors as the commercial    banks, the international financial institutions, and such 'trans-national' actors    as the fraternity of central bankers, or indeed the networks of public and private    financial institutions within the debtor countries. Indeed, it could be argued    that even adding such non-state actors to the analysis would be inadequate for    the debt problem reflects structural characteristics of the international economic    system that go beyond the scope of all actor-centred interpretations. Capital    flight is a major complication that requires a structural explanation. But in    the 1980s the Latin American debt problem has been punctuated by episodes of    crisis - such as the Mexican rescue packages of August 1982 and July 1986 and    the Brazilian interest moratorium of February 1987  in which the deliberate    actions of governments have come to the fore. If a structural situation gives    rise to manifestly harmful and destabilizing consequences, major actors will    attempt to modify that structure (often, no doubt, with unintended results).    In conditions of national economic crisis or emergency, governments will intervene,    even in areas which in more normal times are the responsibility of private agents.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Thus although a narrowly state-centred    approach would be inadequate for explaining the Latin American debt problem,    it would be equally mistaken to ignore the privileged role of state action in    shaping, precipitating (and conceivably even in resolving) that problem. After    all, Latin American governments chose (or were forced?) to socialize much of    the debt of their private corporations at the same time that they confronted    an acute public external debt squeeze. The major commercial creditors bargain    directly with Latin American presidents and economic cabinets, and their strategies    arc closely monitored (e-ven perhaps supervised) by their home finance ministries    and Central Banks. At least in the 1980s, and at least in Latin America, the    debt crisis has uncovered the last resort character of state involvement in    the international lending process. African experience has been different in    that private capital flows were never so important, and East Asian experience    is also different in that for the most part the last resort role of the state    has remained pretty much hidden behind the activities of private agents. But    an international relations perspective on the power realities uncovered by the    Latin American debt crisis should be of more than purely regional interest.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This article focuses on a few issues,    which frequently arise in international relations, and which reapper in a distinctive    guise in discussions of Latin American debt. The brief historical survey to    follow looks particularly at the relationship between private creditors and    the US government, to identify the circumstances in which the power of Washington    may be enlisted in the cause of sovereign debt collection. In the 1980s the    Reagan administration resisted demands for overt government involvement, and    the bargaining process largely involved the private banks and multilateral financial    institutions dealing 'case by case' with individual debtor nations (although    no doubt there was orchestration by creditor governments in the background).    The next section shows that the result has not been the restorations of voluntary    capital flows, but a protracted deadlock in which the development objectives    of the debtors habe been sacrificed, and the creditor banks have run out of    concessions to offer, while broader American foreign policy interests have been    neglected. Sections 4 and 5 consider several facets of this outcome, discussing    the underlying structural asymmetries between the two sides, and offering an    interpretation of debtor disunity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>It is instructive to compare the    interaction between today's debtor governments and creditor banks with what    took place in earlier eras.</b></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Historical    Background</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> It is instructive to compare the interaction    between today's debtor governments and creditor banks with what took place in    earlier eras. Before the First World War it was fairly standard practice (certainly    in the Caribbean) for creditor banks to enforce their claims against recalcitrant    debtor governments by taking control of the customs house and appropriating    the tax revenue until arrears were cleared. To do this the private bankers required    military backing, which was periodically made available by their own governments.    Problems arose when creditors of more than one nationality induced their respective    governments to enforce their claims. The 1904 Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe    Doctrine inaugurated a period of 'Dollar Diplomay' in Latin America in which    the US government undertook to collect debts on behalf of European creditors,    thereby removing any pretext for extra  continental military intervention.<a name="8not"></a><a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a>     Under this regime debt collecting from theoretically sovereign governments was    functionally rather similar to conventional bankruptcy proceedings. The creditor    had access to sufficient 'legitimate' means of compulsion to seize the assets    of the reneging debtor and to enforce the priority of this claim.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> By the time of    the Great Depression most debtor governments had secured rather more leeway.    The last US Marines were withdrawn from the last Caribbean protectorate in 1934    (under the 'Good Neighbour Policy') and no more would be sent until 196S. In    fact this method has not been used for debt collection since 1917  subsequent    military interventions have all been primarily for reasons of national security.    Theoretically, ever since the defeat of the Kaiser United States ascendancy    in the western hemisphere has been the ultimate guarantee against the use of    force for debt collection by any non-American creditor. But British bondholders    found they had no redress when most of their Latin American paper went into    default in the early 1930s. (This episode marked the virtual eclipse of a British    economic and financial pre-eminence that had existed for over a century.) In    fact American bondholders fared no better during the 1930s since former Assistant    Navy Secretary Franklin Delano Roosevelt was determined not to revert to the    methods of dollar diplomacy that he had practised in his youth. Moreover, creditors    of all nationalities were also hampered by the legal form in which most debts    had been contracted in the interwar period. The only issue for negotiation was    whether or not full debt service would be resumed, and all arrears made good,    in accordance with the original contract. Representatives of the bondholders    were not empowered to vary their terms or to offer any other kind of inducements    to comply, unless they could secure the <i>unanimity </i>of all claimants. Since    many bondholders were private individuals each with a small proportion of the    total debt, this requirement posed an insuperable obstacle to renegotiations.    Since the slump made it a material impossibility for many debtors to meet their    obligations in full the result was total impasse. Only one avenue of escape    from the deadlock was explored before the Second World War. Since 'busted bonds'    (i.e. government bonds on which no interest had been paid or was expected to    be paid) could be purchased on the stock market for a small fraction of their    nominal value, some debtor governments were tempted to buy in and cancel their    debt. But bondholders and the legal establishment in London and New York regarded    such practice as little different from outright theft.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The impasse was broken by the Second    World War, which elevated the claims of US national security above the mere    defence of bondholders property rights. Under the Lend-Lease Act of 1940, and    various bilateral negotiations organized from the White House in the early years    of the Second War, American creditors were in effect compensated or bought-off    by the American taxpayer. This cleared the way for close wartime economic and    security co-operation between the United States and the Latin republics. (Note    that European creditors were not so fortunate     FDR was not an upholder of the Roosevelt Corollary.) It can, in fact, be argued    that from 1940 until 1982 it was die last resort availability of American public    funds that provided the ultimate security to Latin America's creditors.<a name="9not"></a><a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>     If the worst came to the worst Washington would no longer send the Marines to    protect the rights of the lenders but it would (either directly or through such    multilateral agencies as the IMF) interpose the authority of the United States        backed by public funds or public guarantees     to induce debtor governments to offer concessions, and to promote a constructive    collective response from the private creditors. If a debtor government considered    the concessions required were too draconian only two means of escape from this    system were possible     either by delinking from all conventional financial circuits (as in the case    of Haiti under "Papa Doc' after his re-election in 1963), or by an outright    reversal of alliances and full integration into the Soviet bloc (a course adopted    by Cuba, and perhaps attempted, although with less success, by Chile and Nicaragua).    Since the political and economic costs of such a withdrawal were so high, and    since participation was generally not too onerous, this system became so well-entrenched    it came to be viewed as the natural order of things in the hemisphere. So much    so that by the late 1970s most commercial bankers subscribed to the theory that    'sovereign debt' was less risky (and thus required lower margins and less evaluation)    than all but the most highly rated corporate debt.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But in private    financial markets 'confidence' is a volatile commodity. Bankerly discussions    of the risklessness of sovereign debt displayed great sophistication on peripheral    matters combined with a cavalier attitude to the central question, namely the    reliability of their ultimate source of security. The unspoken assumption went    that if anything was seriously wrong the entire western financial system would    be at risk, and not just the balance sheet of individual banks. Therefore a    collective public remedy would be sure to emerge. Little attention was paid    to the marked erosion of US political and military authority in Latin America    since the 1940s; or to the fact that during the 1960s and 1970s sanctions for    non-fulfilment of international contractual obligations had gradually eased;    or to the significance of the fact that sovereign debt was being made available    on a large scale and on relatively easy terms, to a much wider array of borrowers    than in the past. In short 'confidence' rested on complacency and forgetfulness.    The available remedies against default had lost much of their potency from disuse.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Logic of    the Bargaining Process</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 'If you owe the bank a thousand pounds    you are at their mercy; if you owe a million pounds they are at your mercy.'    Five or six digits must be added to this old dictum before it can be applied    to Third World debt in the 1980s. Even then it overstates the shift in bargaining    power from creditor to debtor. In a traditional banking regime a large individual    debtor might turn the tables on his creditors by fleeing the country or otherwise    destroying the collateral. By contrast, in August 1982, when the government    of Mexico ran out of foreign reserves while owing eighty billion dollars to    its bankers, all parties to the transaction could at least feel certain that    Mexico would continue to trade with the United States. Thus at least for this    debtor there could be no question of withdrawal from the western financial system    or the liquidation of the long-term collateral represented by her prospective    foreign exchange earnings. This is why Mexico's 'sovereign debt' was rated so    highly by the commercial bankers, and also why the crisis was instantly classified    as one of temporary illiquidity only. The 'insolvency' of Mexico was assumed    to be unthinkable.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> We now have almost seven years experience    of the bargaining process between the Mexican government and her creditors.    (The Mexican experience serves well to illustrate the underlying logic of the    relationship. As we shall see below, although some other Latin American debtors    may be less tightly integrated into the international financial system, or of    less strategic importance to Washington, the essential principles remain the    same.) Since both sides know that in some form the relationship is sure to continue    there is always some degree of tacit collusion. For example, it is not in the    interests of either side to invoke the word 'default'. 'Arrears of payment'    only become a formal 'default' if one or other of the parties to the transaction    publicly declares so. But debtors have no interest in making any such declaration,    which would almost inevitably trigger various forms of retaliation. So long    as the money due is not being paid they will be willing to use softer language<a name="10not"></a><a href="#not10"><sup>10</sup></a>     that keeps open the option of an eventual resumption of payments.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Since 1982 creditor    banks have also judged it to be in their interest to avoid or postpone any formal    declaration of default. The reason for this is the one indicated by the old    dictum. Too many debtors might turn out to be in default on too much debt, inflicting    more losses than the balance sheets of even the largest and richest banks could    absorb. Since to declare Mexico in default would amount to commercial suicide    by most of America's leading banks, they will prefer some less confrontational    stance under almost any circumstances. This was spectacularly true in 1982,    and I believe it remains the case even now, despite all the efforts made by    the money centre banks to reduce their vulnerability since then. The point    to emphasize is that at least the three largest debtors (Brazil, Mexico and    Argentina) are individually so important that each on its own could seriously    destabilize the US banking system. Moreover the debt crisis is sufficiently    systemic and region-wide to raise the possibility of a 'domino effect' if any    one of these countries was seen to be 'getting away' with default. This is the    reverse of the 'normal' banking relationship, in which each bank expects a small    proportion of its debts to go bad, with consequences that will be exemplary    for other borrowers, but not devastating to the lender.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>But in private    financial markets 'confidence' is a volatile commodity.</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> So what options are left open to Latin    America's creditors if they can neither send the Marines, nor requisition the    assets of non-payers, nor accept their losses and walk away from the area of    business? They are condemned to a protracted and unsatisfying succession of    negotiations, with only a modest range of inducements or punishments at their    disposal. The remaining methods of influence fall into three main categories.    First, there is praise (or condemnation) for particular debtor governments and    for specific political leaders, meted out according to their conduct in negotiations.    This is a surprisingly prominent element in the bargaining process even though    its efficacy may seem doubtful. (Currently Latin American leaders are more likely    to achieve popularity as <i>bêtes noires </i>of the bankers than as their proteges.)    One reason why praise-blame has figured so prominently is that most Latin American    leaders hold a common set of assumptions and liberal values which they share    (or aspire to share) with the leaders of the developed capitalist world. Most    would go to some lengths to avoid being blamed for damaging the world financial    system, or for economic irresponsibility, even if on a narrow calculation of    national self-interest there might seem nothing to lose. Praise and approval    at the Annual Meeting of the Fund and Bank has been seen as a desirable goal    in its own right, and for some it may lead to personal and political advancement,    even if the policies being praised are not generally considered successful by    the populace at home. There are exception of course (President Garcia of Peru    seems to have courted international unpopularity, and so did the late Brazilian    Finance Minister Funaro). Moreover this form of bankerly influence tends to    wane over time, as the intractability of the issues becomes apparent and 'debt    fatigue' sets in.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Second, there    is the offer of financial inducements (or sanctions). Obviously this method    of influence is closely linked (though not reducible) to the first. Committees    of bank creditors (usually in co-ordination with the IMF) have been convened    virtually continuously since 1982 to work out the terms and conditions they    would attach to debt rescheduling agreements. Setting a-side the often intricate    details, the essence of all these negotiations is under what conditions the    creditors will agree to soften the terms of outstanding debt service arrangements,    and how much 'new money' they will add. Compared with the initial terms of the    loan, the creditors will regard any concessions as additional costs. The 'financial    inducement' they can offer is therefore their willingness to commit themselves    to these costs. In principle such inducement is most likely to be offered to    those Third World borrowers whose governments are receiving praise for their    economic policies. It is most likely to be withheld from those whose governments    are under criticism. That, as least, is the theory underlying the "case    by case' approach to debt rescheduling.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>An important    feature of the creditors bargaining stance in the 1980s as compared with the    preceding forty years, is that the cost of any concessions must be borne directly    by the private commercial bankers.</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Over time, however, it has become apparent    that the reality is rather different. Some of the best behaved and most highly    praised debtor governments may not enjoy much bargaining power. Even Colombia    and Venezuela seem recently to have concluded that the effort to behave like    exemplary debtors was not worthwhile, considering the poor response from creditor    banks. Many commercial bankers seem unwilling or unable to discriminate in favour    of the better managed Latin American debtors. Instead they have used the time    made available by such stop-gap measures as the 'Baker Plan' to reduce their    exposure to Latin American risks of all kinds. Such private creditors thus have    less interest than either debtor or creditor governments in 'solving' the debt    problem. They will just turn their backs on it.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Not only have    'model' debtors lacked worthwhile rewards, but in some cases 'bad' debtor behaviour    has extracted concessions from the creditors - at least in the short run  that    might otherwise have been unavailable. Some major debtor governments which seem    on the brink of an uncontrollable crisis (perhaps even caused by their own mismanagement)    may be in a position to frighten their creditors into otherwise undesirable    concessions. Bankers try not to admit this reality (which they call 'moral hazard')    but after seven years of debt crisis this evidence is all too plain. A conspicuous    example of this latter kind was the Mexican rescue package of August 1982, which    precipitated the Third World debt crisis. According to Joseph Kraft, who conducted    extensive interviews with policymakers in Washington and Mexico City, the US    financial community were completely unresponsive to Mexican warnings and appeals    for help before the crisis broke.<a name="11not"></a><a href="#not11"><sup>11</sup></a>    The only way for the Mexicans to secure sufficiently high level attention was    by going over the brink. This element in the bargaining problem has recurred    time after time, most notably in the recent past as the debt situation has deteriorated.    (Examples include Mexico's near default in June 1986, Brazil's suspension of    interest payments in February 1987, and Argentina's apparent use of duress against    the IMF in October 1987. The "Acapulco Pact' of November 1987 can also    be viewed in this light.)</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> An important feature    of the creditors' bargaining stance in the 1980s as compared with the preceding    forty years, is that the cost of any concessions must be borne directly by the    private commercial bankers. Although the international agencies and the US administration    have intervened strenuously at times to encourage flexible rescheduling and    'involuntary lending' there has been a great reluctance to back these recommendations    with public funds. In the end, of course, western taxpayers will be landed with    a substantial proportion of the costs, as commercial bankers make provision    for their bad loans which reduce their liability for taxation.<a name="12not"></a><a href="#not12"><sup>12</sup></a>     But this use of public money confers far less initiative and leadership on the    governments of the western countries than if they were directly and visibly    committeed to underwriting a 'new deal' for the debtors. The creditors    are therefore locked into a much more defensive and reactive stance than was    the case for example under the Marshall Flan or the Alliance for Progress.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The third, and in the long term the    most prowerful, of the methods of influence available to the creditors is the    ability to offer, or to withhold market openness. Here the initiative shifts    from the financial institutions to creditor governments and decisions are taken    not only in response to the debt crisis but also with other (trade, security,    and political) considerations in mind. US policies towards Mexico and the Caribbean    offer examples of the use of market access as an inducement to the debtors to    co-operate (consider especially the Caribbean Basin Initiative, launched in    1983). But in <i>South </i>America restrictions of market access are aggravating    the debt crisis, and in part they are being used to pressurize recalcitrant    debtors. Thus, for example, Mexico could be 'rewarded' by the United States    for its efforts at co-operative debt management with the prospect of a bilateral    free trade agreement that would shelter Mexico from prospective US protectionism.    Argentina, on the other hand, has found its capacity to export (and therefore    to service its debts) severely crippled first by EEC protectionism and then    by aggressive US promotion of competitive agricultural exports. Brazil could    easily slip into a trade war with the United States, one element of which appears    to reflect Washington's frustration o ver Brazil's uncooperative behaviour on    debt servicing.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Summing up, the methods of influence    available to the creditors seems much weaker than in the past. Those methods    most directly available to the financial community seem increasingly ineffective    as the debt problem drags on and grows worse. Stronger inducements are in principle    available to western governments, but these are governed by other powerful considerations    and not just by the requirements of debt management.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now consider the perspective of the    debtors. They need to attract high level attention in the dominant centres of    power. They also need to reassure long-suffering domestic opinion that national    interests and priorities are not being needlessly sacrificed to the unreasonable    demands of foreign bankers. In Latin America there is now a widespread view    that unless debtor governments take forceful action on the debt servicing front    the home economy will suffer indefinite stagnation and disruption, while a major    fraction of domestic savings will be transferred abroad in debt service payments.    (The net transfer of resources from Latin America averaged $30 billion per year    in 1983/85. It was cut to $24 billion in 1986, and to $17 billion in 1987, but    climbed back to $29 billion in 1988. In any case this amounted to 3.5 per cent    of regional GNP, or a fifth of its export earnings since 1982. By comparison    German reparations payments averaged 2.5 per cent of GNP 1925-32.) The result    is that nearly all debtor governments have felt periodically constrained to    mount displays of firm resolve. President Sarney's address to the United Nations    in September 1985, President de La Madrid's dramatic nationwide television broadcast    of February 1986, and President Alfonsin's emotional press conference in November    1987, all provide illustrations of this. However, in each ease the visible results    of these displays of resolve have been relatively modest, and the underlying    crisis has continued to fester.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The essential    problem for debtor governments is that even when they are tempted to take measure    which punish the creditors for their unhelpfulness, the risks of retaliation    and self-harm always appears to be too great. This was what finally persuaded    President de la Madrid to back off from confrontation with the banks in the    middle of 1986 (it was a very finely balanced decision, however). Brazil has    not yet produced a clearcut policy either way. Only Peru has chosen outright    defiance  initially with some success, but with disastrous consequences    over the medium term.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>The third,    and in the long term the most prowerful, of the methods of influence available    to the creditors is the ability to offer, or to withhold market openness.</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here it is worth noting that various    economic analysts have proposed interpretative frameworks intended to indicate    when it is 'rational' for a debtor nation to default on its obligations.<a name="13not"></a><a href="#not13"><sup>13</sup></a>     However, the results have not been very illuminating. This is partly because    the most elegant models seem to require binary choices (namely, either 'unilateral    default' or 'unqualified compliance') whereas Third World diplomacy almost invariably    involves clouding the issue (for example, 'undeclared arrears' and 'tacitly    accepted moratoria'). By the time of President Bush's inauguration the debate    had narrowed to a choice between 'voluntary debt reduction' schemes favoured    by the creditors, versus the "generalized debt relief including some element    of forgiveness' favoured by the most ambitious of the debtor governments. It    is also because in the real world debtor governments rightly consider the consequences    of a unilateral default to be extremely unpredictable. The debt situation is    rather like a tense and reluctant peace. Each government considering whether    to launch a war may be deterred by extreme uncertainty about how all others    will react. The likely strategy is then to prepare for war, but to wait for    someone else to break the peace. If so, the outcome will be determined more    by accident or miscalculation than by any rational cálculos of national self-interest.    Indeed, too much reliance on such 'economic' models of decision-making could    lead the creditors to a dangerous complacency.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In summary then,    the debtors are driven to use strong rhetoric against the demands of the creditors,    but their implied threats are less than fully credible. Most debtor governments    would much prefer to reach a permanent accommodation with the creditors that    would settle the issue once and for all, but many commercial bankers may prefer    a protracted process of disengagement which gives them time to rebuild their    capital and which preserves a united front against the principle of 'forgiveness'.    Thus, so long as creditor governments refuse to step in and assume part of the    risk borne by the commercial banks both sides seem locked into a frustrating    cycle of threats and reconciliations, neither of which overcome the underlying    issues of contention. Optimists used to hope that with the passage of time and    the recovery of the world economy the intensity of these conflicts would gradually    diminish. Less optimistic observers at least assumed that shins in bargaining    strength would occur which would lead to a clear-cut outcome within say five    years. But after almost seven years the alternative hypothesis of endemic tension    seems more plausible. With the passage of time the intractability of the conflict    of interest could become more evident and the prospect of any eventual negotiated    resolution may recede from ciew. If so, frustration could well lead some debtors    to the adoption of apparently suboptimal strategies  that is, what commentators    on the autarchy of the 1930s used to call 'beggar my neighbour' policies, which    in fact beggar oneself. Several of the existing leaders of Latin America have    at some point contemplated such a possibility, only to back away from it. President    Garcia of Peru did not back away, but many in his country now wish he had. For    this course is in fact a gamble (not really a rational calculation of probabilities)    that a desperate act may call forth otherwise unobtainable concessions. Although    the experience of the past few years suggests that the gamble will fail, newly    e-lected leaders in some Latin American countries may well come to office pledged    to take the risk, and perhaps be completely unaware of where it could lead them.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>The Underlying    Asymmetry (They hired the money, didn't they?)</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In the liberal model of 'arms length'    transactions all agents are formally equal, free to choose between alternative    courses of action according to their respective views of self-interest. They    accordingly assume full responsibility for the contracts that they make. That    is the assumption underlying Calvin Coolidge's celebrated rebuff to the recalcitrant    Latin American debtors of the 1920s.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> But most Latin American leaders have    been raised on the 'patron-client' model of reciprocal exchange, in which typical    relationships are hierarchical and mediated through particularistic networks.    The clients must accept a partial surrender of autonomy, in return for which    the patron accepts a responsibility to protect them in times of adversity. Anglo-Saxon    and Latin American perceptions of the debt crisis differ not only because the    former are the creditors and the latter are the debtors, but also because (despite    an assumed framework of common values) there are also important, if unspoken,    social and cultural differences between the two societies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Certainly if we compare the domestic    financial systems of the main Latin American nations with that of the United    States, it is clear that they must operate on very different assumptions. (Actually    most Latin American find it difficult to believe that liberal individualism    provides a truthful account oh how even US institutions actually operate, an    understandable scepticism, but not a topic to be explored in this paper.) When    the debt crisis broke, for example, it was considered quite natural for the    Central Banks in almost all Latin American republics (even in 'Chicago School'    Chile) to take over responsibility for the external debt obligations of troubled    private enterprises (effectively to 'socialize' bad private debt). Since 1982    attempts have been made to 'nationalize' the domestic banking system in Mexico,    El Salvador and Peru, not to mention post-embargo Panama. Even in such financially    sophisticated countries as Brazil, no one is really surprised to find that,    when the government changes, friends and business associates of the outgoing    administration lose their privileged access to the financial system. They may    even face severe audits and the early calling-in of loans, whereas credit becomes    much more generously available to those well-connected with the new incumbents.    With three digit inflation the norm, rather than the exception, in post-1982    Latin America access to good financial intelligence and control over the intermediation    of domestic savings is fr more vital to economic survival than in the developed    OECD economies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> More    generally the idea of equal treatment for all potential clients is not built    into the structure of the Latin American financial system. Insted there is actually    a multiplicity of specialized banking institutions (one for the trade unions,    another for members of the armed forces, another for low income housing, and    so on) with overlapping remits and offering differing degrees of 'favouritism'.    There is usually also an operating assumption that the Central Bank will be    obliged to bail out any subordinate financial intermediaries that run into severe    difficulties, at least <i>unless </i>there is a political decision to the contrary.    (In the United States the presumption is the opposite, although the practice    may be rather mixed as the current experience of the savings and loan associations    and some of the farm credit institutions indicate. At any rate, in the 1980s    American banks have been failing at a rate not seen since the early 1930s. In    Latin America on the other hand, more banks than ever have been 'intervened'    or nationalized.)</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Since this is how the domestic financial    system operates in the typical Latin American republic, it is almost inevitable    that such experiences will be reflected in popular (and even some elite) assumptions    about the international financial system. One such assumption would be that    America's most loyal allies (most reliable clients) are entitled to a degree    of protection from Washington when the international economy turns sour. Another    would be that even if the formal answer from the international community is    'no', surely there must be some particularistic route to special concessions    (for example, Silva Herzog's friendship with Paul Volcker, Simonsen's position    on the board of Citicorp). If at first these expectations are not confirmed    by experience, the inference may be drawn that the crisis has yet to peak. At    a later stage the crisis will still elicit the protective intervention that    <i>must </i>eventually be dispensed by a patron to his distressed clients, for    the underlying relationship to be preserved.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In fact the experience    of the past seven years suggests that neither the Ccolidge approach nor the    'patron-client' model of creditor/debtor relations does full justice tc the    facts. The myth that all debtors receive formal equality of treatment has been    progressively eroded, as when the IMF relaxed its normal criteria to assist    Mexico (summer 1986) or when the US government used financial pressure as a    means of political discipline in Central America. But so far the limits on favouritism    have been extremely narrow, notwithstanding the scale and duration of the debt    crisis. The critical sticking point appears to be that neither private nor public    international creditors can allow themselves to be seen lending to distressed    debtors at less than their own 'cost of funds'. To do so, they maintain, would    undermine the entire rationale of commercial banking practice, and would destroy    the confidence of their depositors. Only a formal guarantee, or subsidy, backed    by taxpayer's funds, would enable them to give ground on this point. But neither    Lend-Lease nor the Alliance for Progress were viewed as acceptable precedents    in Reagan's America, and indeed the US fiscal crisis almost precluded such remedies.    Herein lies the basic asymmetry between the two sides. To some extent it reflects    a difference of doctrine, to some extent an inequality of power. But above all    it expresses a weakening of US authority in the western hemisphere.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>In summary then,    the debtors are driven to use strong rhetoric against the demands of the creditors,    but their implied threats are less than fully credible.</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Despite the 'cost    of funds' limit to concessions the creditors are not entirely locked into a    stance of Coolidge-like inflexibility. In fact <i>before </i>the debt crisis    broke the banks were lending so profitably that there was initially considerable    scope for concessions. But it seems that the final sticking point was reached    in February 1987. Before then a great deal of ingenuity was expended on blurring    the limits. But the possibilities for softening the conflict between two clearly    opposed positions now seem practically exhausted. <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>    shows in stylized form the series of concessions that have typically been made    as debt rescheduling has proceeded.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ea/v3n7/7a08t1.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> LIBOR is London    Inter-Bank Offer Rate, the lowest cost of funds available to the most credit-worthy    banks. If 'margin over LIBOR' fell to zero, banks would be onlending funds at    the cheapest rate they themselves could obtain. (In fact only the most credit-worthy    banks can borrow at LIBOR, whereas the credit ratings of 12 major North American    banks are currently under threat of downgrading because of their heavy exposure    to Argentina, Brazilian and Venezuelan debt.) This would leave no surplus for    administrative overheads. Even for the largest most credit-worthy and most efficient    bank the true 'cost of funds' cannot be far below LIBOR + 7/8 per cent, and    that would now typically involve borrowing short-term money to finance a sixteen-year-long    commitment. Moreover, <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a> does not include the 'involuntary    lending' which banks have been pressured into undertaking since 1982, often    simply so that their creditors can be recorded as current in their interest    payments. (Such 'involuntary lending' began with the Mexican rescue of 1982;    it has become more difficult to organize since the Brazilian interest moratorium    of February 1987.)</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In addition to the gradual softening    of repayment terms by the private creditors shown in the Table there has also    been a softening of the macro-policy conditions required by the public agencies    that are also a party to most reschedulings. Thus IMF 'conditionality' has become    somewhat more flexible, in part because otherwise it was feared that some major    debtors might reach agreements with their commercial creditors bypassing the    Fund altogether. Since the 'Baker Initiative' the Fund and Bank have been engaged    in a major reshaping of their lending operations to take into account the urgency    of the debt crisis. Large increases in capital are envisaged, and other important    operational reforms are in prospect. However, as with the commercial banks,    there are some major 'sticking points' beyond which these official institutions    would begin to undermine their own foundations. Indeed, in the view of many    Latin American observers, these institutions seem near to the limits of their    own capacity for 'adjustment' to the debt crisis.<a name="14not"></a><a href="#not14"><sup>14</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One further source    of flexibility has been the relaxation of monetary policy that took place during    President Reagan's second term, partly in response to the oil price collapse    of 1986 and then the stock market slump of October 1987. For a while this permitted    a considerable decline in the dollar interest rates payable by mos sovereign    debtors, but such relief has not continued into the Bush administration. This    policy shift was not, of course, a-dopted solely or even mainly to grant relief    to Third World debtors. But it bought them some time, and it constituted the    only form of Northern assistance to the South that could be extended without    aid-legislation or other politically impractical initiatives.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the time of writing this paper it    seems that all these methods for easing the financial burdens faced by Third    World debtors are nearing their limits, and still the difficulties of debt servicing    remain as intractable as ever.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Commercial banks    have little more to offer in the form of softer rescheduling terms, 'unless    they go below the cost of funds. The resale value of Third World debt has now    fallen to a low fraction of its face value (see <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>),    so low that further private bank lending (even of an 'involuntary' variety)    becomes a commercial nonsense. A growing number of debtor countries have accumulated    such interest arrears with the IMF that they are barred from further borrowing    by the Fund under any policy conditions and many others have commited themselves    to Fund performance targets that are known to be unrealistic. This is a situation    of weakness that can hardly be allowed to continue if the Fund is to remain    in business. Monetary relaxation in the developed countries must also be reaching    the limits of effectiveness. Fiscal conditions in the North mean that the chances    of a large and far-reaching programme of relief and assistance for distressed    debtors of the Third World still seem to be highly problematical. Many innovative    debt schemes have been canvassed in the course of President Reagan's last year,    and a far-reaching review od debt options has been one of the first foreign    policy priorities of the incoming Bush administration.    But the basic difficulty with all these alternatives is that as a continuing    business US commercial banks will not voluntarily lend on depositors funds below    cost, without some public guarantee that would have to be backed by taxpayers'    funds. The prospective Federal budget deficits of the early 1990s and the US    constitutional structure present almost insuperable obstacles to such an initiative,    even if the administration were in sympathy with this approach, and even if    Congressmen were not preoccupied with the cost of bailing out troubled domestic    financial institutions, such as the savings and loans banks and the farm credit    system.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>But above all    it expresses a weakening of US authority in the western hemisphere.</b></font></p>     <p><a name="tab2"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ea/v3n7/7a08t2.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> At the heart of the matter is the fact    that since the mid-1980s the United States has become a major debtor nation,    and for years to come the US Treasury will be competing with Latin American    sovereign debtors for international dollar borrowings. Admittedly many of the    schemes under consideration envisage the involvement of Japanese and West European    banks and governments, and the use of multilateral agencies such as the IMF    and World Bank to supervise the provision of new loans to Latin America. But    the basic political difficulty remains     without strong US government involvement these schemes are unlikely to go ahead,    both because a Washington guarantee is required to persuade others to assume    their share of the risk, and because US foreign policy and security interests    (and the Monroe mystique) would be affected if non-American governments were    to bypass the United States in her own hemisphere.<a name="15not"></a><a href="#not15"><sup>15</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Most debtors,    on the other hand, believe that on unchanged policies the prospects confronting    them are so grave that 'something will have to give'. Naturally they view the    problem from a self-interested vantage point, and they also view it through    a somewhat different perceptual lens. In practical terms they have to decide    whether to continue making the agreed debt service payments (even though this    may involve indefinite economic stagnation) in conformity to a system of ideas    that they do not wholly share. The underlying a-symmetry is only partly a function    of the limited bargaining power of the debtors. It also reflects the authority    of dominant western economic and financial doctrines. These ideas still hold    sway to some extent in most of Latin America, although without the unchallengeable    ascendancy they have recently enjoyed in New York and London. It is because    these ideas have so far retained most of their international authority that    Latin American debtors have displayed only hesitant, sporadic, and half-hearted    resistance through seven years of massive negative resource transfers. (Imagine    what the response would have been if debtors with identical objective bargaining    power had been steeped in Islamic ideas about usury, or Marxis ideas about the    exploitative nature of market transaction.) Fortunately for the western creditors,    patron-client relationships are non-ideological in character, or to be more    precise the client customarily defers to most of the assumptions of his patron.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Moreover    the Latin American republics confronting these debt problems also have many    other features in common  ties of language, religion, culture, a shared history    of political emancipation, and of peripheral 'dependent' development.</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Another feature    of patron-client relations which serves to maintain hierarchy is that the patron    characteristically keeps his clients divided and in competition with each other    for his favour. In fact most patron-client systems undergo periodic tests of    strength, whereby a dissatisfied or alienated client probes the resolve of the    patron and the loyalty of his other clients. System maintenance therefore requires    periodic episodes of assertive leadership, in which the patron disciplines challengers    and distributes favours to loyal clients. This model captures the essentials    of the 'case-by-case' approach towards Third World debt that has so far predominated    in Washington. Of course if the clients manage to negotiate a united stance    the underlying asymmetry of power may be shifted. But even after the Cartagena    Club and the 'Acapulco Pact' of November 1987,<a name="16not"></a><a href="#not16"><sup>16</sup></a>  a distinguishing    feature of the Latin American response to seven years of 'debt crisis' has been    the persistent disunity of the debtors.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>The Disunity    of the Debtors</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> An outsider with    no knowledge of the customs and traditions of the region would surely conclude    on the basis of structural considerations that Latin American debtors were exceptionally    well-placed to achieve agreement on some collective strategy of self-defence.    The debt crisis struck all countries in the region at the same time; seven years    later they are all, without exception, still under the same shadow; there are    no clearcut examples of successful escape from the problems besetting the rest.    (Chile is often cited, but see <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>.) Moreover successful    debt management is a top priority for all governments in the region. There are    no 'cross-cutting cleavages' so pressing as to over-ride the solidarity generated    by the common predicament (for example, no regional wars, no acute geopolitical    imbalances). Even in Central America, where ideological polarization is most    acute, the presidents of the five Central Banks have always maintained a degree    of co-operation on the debt issue (and of course since August 1987 the presidents    of the five republics have established broader common ground motivated essentially    by the need to tackle common economic problems). Moreover the Latin American    republics confronting these debt problems also have many other features in common     ties of language, religion, culture, a shared history of political emancipation,    and of peripheral 'dependent' development. They are nearly all 'middle income'    countries, with similar deficiencies of domestic savings in relation to the    investment requirements for 'catch up' growth. (Which is why in the 1970s commercial    creditors regarded them all as 'bankable' propositions.) A decade ago they almost    all shared a strong preference for 'sovereign borrowing' rather than private    foreign investment or equity flotations and they all considered it almost 'natural'    to borrow in <i>dollars, </i>at floating rates, mainly from US banks.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> This is a remarkably    constraining list of shared characteristics. Consider the potencial sources    of disunity that it excludes. The region contains no creditor countries (although    several Latin American nations are major oil exporters and some are even members    of OPEC). There are no 'East Asian NICs' (Hong Kong, Taiwan) whose irrepressible    export orientation would undermine debtor unity. Only Cuba and Nicaragua are    under US embargo, and even they have accumulated substantial dollar debt with    non-US banks. There is no ethnic minority with a political or economic orientation    radically different from that of the majority, to sow regional dissension (cf.    the Jewish population in the Middle East, the Afrikaner population in South    Africa, the Chinese traders of South-East Asia). With the arguable exception    of Puerto Rico there is no privileged ally of the dominant creditor power helping    to 'divide and rule' the debtors.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ea/v3n7/7a08f1.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Yet this remarkable list of unifying    factors has not so far been sufficient to produce much effective co-operation    or unity of action among the Latin American debtors. Despite the rhetoric of    the 'Cartagena accord' and, the more ambitious and urgent meeting of efected    heads of state (in Acapulco in November 1987), there is still little prospect    of the 'debtors' cartel' initially feared by many western banks. Why not?<a name="17not"></a><a href="#not17"><sup>17</sup></a>     United action would require an authoritative source of leadership; individual    debtor governments would have to surrender a substantial margin of discretion;    there would need to be a tacit 'insurance scheme' to share the risks of possible    retaliation; all this implies a degree of forward planning that would be regarded    as aggressive by the creditors. Yet the only aim around which the debtors could    unite would be to spur their bankers into    negotiating a more generous and far-reaching co-operative solution. They fear    that overly aggressive action is more likely to jeopardize such a response than    otherwise. Consequently debtor solidarity can only be constructed on a defensive    and reactive basis.<a name="18not"></a><a href="#not18"><sup>18</sup></a>  In large measure the Cartagena and Acapulco    rhetoric is designed to mask this underlying weakness.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Let us consider each of these assertions    more closely. So far two Latin American Chief Executives have volunteered as    leaders of a radical debtors' front. Fidel Castro's offer was of course immediately    discounted, given Cuba's exceptional dependence on soviet aid. President Garcia's    stance has been greeted with widespread admiration in political assemblies outside    Peru, but those who applauded have not had the responsibility for conducting    the economic affairs of their own countries. In practice there are only three    Presidents who can realistically aspire to lead a united Latin American front.    These are the ones responsible for the three largest debtors     Brazil (with a public debt of $115 billion at the end of 1988), Mexico ($97    billion) and just possibly Argentina ($57 billion). Over the past seven years    each of these countries has teetered on the brink of default, only to be pulled    back at the last moment, at least in part by a sense of isolation. Thus the    first flashpoint was Mexico in 1982, the Brazil in 1983, Argentina in 1984,    Mexico again in 1986, and finally Brazil once more in 1987. But the three governments    never acted in concert. On the contrary they have been systematically out of    phase with each other. A collapse in oil prices benefits Brazil, just as it    pushes Mexico into crisis. When Argentina was on the brink of measures that    might have undermined the credit-worthiness of all Latin America debtors, Mexico    actually drew on its own reserves to sponsor a bail-out. (At that time Mexico    was being singled out by the western financial establishment as a model debtor.)    The most plausible leader of a debtors' front is Brazil because it has both    the largest debt, and the most flexible and diversified economy. But in 1987    Brazil's capacity for international leadership was crippled by President Sarney's    economic mismanagement, and by the domestic legitimacy crisis. Despite an appearance    of unity at Acapulco, these underlying obstacles to the emergence of an authoritative    source of leadership for a debtors' front probably remain as intractable as    ever. This explains why the Acapulco Pact contained no precise targets, no deadlines    for compliance, and no monitoring apparatus other than an annual summit. In    early 1989 Venezuela (with a $32 billion external debt) attempted to provide    the leadership unavailable from elsewhere, but the essential obstacles remain.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Even if a source    of leadership emerges, potential followers will tend to hang back, at least    in part from reluctance to surrender any degree of national autonomy. Suppose    that the next president of Brazil persuaded all the debtors to join him in a    common front limiting the negative net transfer of resources to a maximum of    2 1/2 per cent of GNP in each country. Not all debtors are capable of    running trade surpluses as large as that of Brazil; not all have such large    internal markets; nor such diversified patterns of trade. Thus other members    of the united front might find themselves under severe pressure for pursuing    Brazil's lead, long before the crunch came for the Brazilians themselves. The    citizens of each republic would naturallu hold their own government accountable    for the national consequences of a more confrontational debt policy. But by    agreeing to join a common front each government would be forgoing much of the    flexibility needed to mitigate such consequences.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Consequently    debtor solidarity can only be constructed on a defensive and reactive basis.</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In theory an 'insurance scheme' might    meet this objection, but in practice this would be almost impossible to devise    or operate. The consequence of confrontation most feared by all debtors is some    form of retaliation by their creditors. Individual creditors might seek legal    redress (for example, confiscation of assets held in the United States) even    though the creditors as a whole had taken no decision in favour of retaliation.    Different debtors (and different interests within each debtor nation ) face    widely differing degrees of exposure to retaliation. The weakest and most exposed    could be running very considerable risks. The strongest and least exposed are    mos unlikely to underwrite schemes of compensation broad enough to cover the    full range of retaliatory possibilities. Even if such promises were made it    would be unwise for the most vulnerable debtors to assume that they would be    fully and promptly honoured.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The creditors would be unlikely to remain    inactive while the debtors undertook the laborious and time-consuming process    of negotiating a front, delegating authority to certain leaders, and defining    the scope and limits of their mutual commitments. Quite the contrary, we can    assume that bankers in general and US government agencies in particular would    respond to such a development with an active and co-ordinated strategy. Certainly    the Bush administration has decided to include national security and general    foreign policy considerations in its debt review, and perhaps for that reason    Mexico expects relatively favourable treatment even if other Latin American    debtors are disappointed. The 'patron-client' model still shapes international    expectations in 1989. The main aim would surely be to scare off the least resolute.    Probably there would also be an increased emphasis on the distinction between    'insolvency' and 'illiquidity' ('can't pay' and 'won't pay'). Some concessions    might be offered to debtors who, due to what could be classified as 'factors    beyond their control', were unable to continue their debt service payments despite    displaying every evidence of goodwill ('conciliatory' default). As for those    whose inability to pay was a result of deliberately uncooperative policy choices    ('aggressive' default) every effort would surely be made to isolate, demoralize,    and if necessary punish them.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The debt issue can be considered from    many different angles. This article has adopted an international relations perspective,    and has dwelt on the logic of the bargaining process, the underlying asymmetry    of power between debtors and creditors, and the factors explaining Latin America's    failure (so far) to establish a debtor's cartel. It has not attempted to assess    the costs or benefits of alternative responses to the debt crisis, and it has    deliberately steered away rom consideration of the feasibility, or merits of,    alternative policy packages.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Perhaps a 'patron-client'    model may be of heuristic value in thinking about this relationship between    creditor financial institutions and debtor governments. There are some family    resemblances between this approach and the 'dependency' literature that has    been so much in vogue in writings about Latin America. However, the dependency    school tended to attribute extraordinary importance to the power and influence    of multinational corporations, and it downplayed the possibility of discretionary    action by national governments. It also ranged almost without limit across many    different topics, trying to include everything from consumption patterns to    ecological problems within a single (very loose) analytical framework. By contrast    this article has been confined to a single major issue which unquestionably    reflects severe international equalities of power and divergences of interest.    It has emphasized the limiting conditions operating in a specific geographical    region at a given historical moment. Multinational corporations with branches    in Latin America have been conspicuous by their absence from the analysis (indeed    Latin American distrust of the MNCS made an important contribution to the build-up    of sovereign debt in the 1970s). The only corporate enterprises that have received    consideration here are <i>external </i>commercial banks.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 'patron-client'    model still shapes international expectations in 1989.</b></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ea/v3n7/7a08f2.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Although it has been suggested that    Latin American governments currently seem to possess only a very limited room    for manoeuvre in response to the debt crisis, this is a conclusion that must    be reached through open-minded historical and comparative analysis, rather than    by assumption. The 'patron-client' framework seems to be a helpful    interpretative device, but should certainly not be used to imply structural    necessity, or to preclude the possibility of constructive change in the direction    of a more genuine international community.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> One explanation for the limited scale    of concessions received by Latin American debtors since 1982 is that they did    not press their creditors hard enough, and this article has explored some of    the reasons for that. But it has al so argued that times of economic crisis    expose the last resort character of state guarantees for market processes. Why    then have the governments of the creditor nations still not directly stepped    in to take over management of the debt crisis which remains manifestly unresolved    by the private banking system? Many commercial bankers would now welcome such    a development, which since 1984 has been sought with growing insistence by almost    all Latin American leaders, and which also commands some prestigious support    among exporters and within the Western policy-making establishment. In fact    both the Japanese and the French governments have indicated a willingness to    adopt this course, which received the general assent of the major industrial    powers at the Toronto summit of June 1988 in the case of sub-Saharan Africa,    so the real question is not why creditor governments in general hold back, but    why Washington in particular is so averse.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Although it has been argued that US    national security and foreign policy objectives could be jeopardized by further    procrastination over Latin American debt, the US administration has not yet    felt pressed by the same sense of imminent crisis as the Latin American leaders    experience. In contrast to the Alliance for Progress reaction to the Cuban revolution,    and the Lend-Lease reaction to the Second World War, there is not the overriding    sense of urgency required to overcome domestic resistance to a costly new Federal    commitment. The 'case-by-case' or patron-client approach still may serve Us    interests provided the debtors have nowhere else to turn. The alternative of    direct government involvement would require both the repudiation of cherished    doctrines, and a great mobilization of domestic support to overcome constitutional    impediments (not an easy task in the absence of a Pearl Harbor or a cold war).    In any case taxpayer involvement would almost inevitably be channelled through    some multilareal institutions in which non-American (especially Japanese) capital    would have considerable weight. The national security argument is thus two-edged        the risk of Latin American disorder will be weighed against the risk of undermining    Monroeism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Some of these    considerations could be classified-as 'structural' explanations for the intractability    of the Latin American debt problem, a few of the points could even be re-expressed    in the language of dependency theory. On balance however, the interpretation    presented in this article privileges the traditions, perceptions, calculations,    and bargaining power of national governments, a conventional set of considerations    no doubt, but they still seem to possess substantial explanatory power.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>LAURENCE WHITEHEAD    </b>é economista, cientista político e professor em Oxford.

The most crucial problem about all such schemes concerns 'the interests    of the potential owners or underwriters of the facility' (i.e. the Bank and    Fund) because any scheme large enough to ease te overall debt problem would    involve 'a large transfer or risk internationally from private banks to the    underwriting governments or multilateral institutions' (p. 420).    <br>   <a name="not15"></a><a href="#15not"><sup>15</sup></a> In January 1989 the Institute    for International Finance, a Washington-based organization reflecting the view    of the major banks, published <i>The Way Forward for Middle-Income Countries    </i>hoping to influence the debt policies of the Bush administration. The debt    problem has gone on too long for the governments of industrialised countries    to view it as something that can be owrked out just between the debtor countries    and their banks' it argued, calling for creditor governments or the World Bank    to guarantee interest on principal, and for the easing of tax rules and banking    regulations.    <br>   <a name="not16"></a><a href="#16not"><sup>16</sup></a> There is a lengthy history    of joint consultations among Latin American debtor governments with the aim    of establishing common ground. The most substantial effort was made by eight    civilian elected presidents, who met in Acapulco in November 1987 to propose    collective negotiations with the region's creditors on the basis of a halving    of the debt service burden.

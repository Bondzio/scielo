Brazil represents approximately 80% of the total frozen concentrate orange juice (FCOJ) traded in the international market. In addition, Brazil and the United States represent 50% of the total fresh orange produced around the world. Sao Paulo state is responsible by 98% of Brazilian FCOJ exports and by 80% of the national fresh orange production. The economic importance of Sao Paulo's citrus industry has been stimulated researches in order to analyze all aspects related to citrus production system. Fertilizer is a very important input into citrus industry, especially in relation to production costs. Thus, this study has outlined the fertilizer consumed by Sao Paulo's citrus industry in the 70's, 80's and 90's. It was developed models to estimate fertilizer consumption related to orange trees yields. Finally, it was developed a model to estimate an orange tree yield (boxes/tree) in relation to grove age from stochastic yields values estimated to each tree age. The models were well adjusted and meeting all econometrics requisites.

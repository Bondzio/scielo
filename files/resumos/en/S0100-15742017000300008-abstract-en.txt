ABSTRACT This article proposes to reconstruct the institutional debates and initiatives around the constitution of sociology as a &#8220;profession&#8221; in Argentine, from the middle of the past century. To do so, it focuses on the career of sociology of the University of Buenos Aires. This is an institution that, since its inception in 1957, has occupied a central position in the sociology field in Argentina. Based on a broader empirical study (which included reviewing syllabus, course plans and other documents, as well as conducting interviews with relevant actors), the present study examines the various positions taken at different times regarding the relation of this discipline to the world of work.

This article aims to present an alternative concept of recognition able to criticize the importance given to themes as the social production of identities. This proposal aims to think how policies of the institutionalization may be an appropriate response to those who seek to dissociate the debate concerning recognition from culturalists perspectives, opening the dynamics of social struggles beyond the so-called "politics of difference". In his own way, this perspective sees itself attached to the recovery of Hegel's concept of subject and aspects of the Marxist concept of "proletariat" as an operator for producing political subjects.

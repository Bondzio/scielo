ABSTRACT This article aims to address the professional training of teachers from the angle of the sociology of the professions. The representation of teaching as a &#8220;vocation&#8221; and the premises of the natural, feminine tendency to perform an activity &#8220;greater&#8221; than - and superior to - other professions, that of the &#8220;educator&#8221;, has brought a tremendous ambiguity to the training of teachers. Our hypothesis is that the spread of this perspective has contributed to the professional misrepresentation of teaching. Professionalism is a necessary condition for the quality of professional practice because, when anchored in professional habitus, it enables the development of reasonable actions (&#8220;sense of play&#8221;) that, incorporated into the actions experienced in the school field, supports good professional training.

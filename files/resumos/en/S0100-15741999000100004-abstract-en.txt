This paper arguments from a communicational standpoint, that education has constantly used communication technologies. Besides nowadays people in teaching positions can no longer pretend to ignore technology, since technology does exist in everyday's life for those they teach. Thus, teaching now requires a minimum technical proficiency, as well as the search for a new balance: traditional teaching models on one hand; modern, more technology based on teaching techniques on the other. As such, this model turns out to be a new challenge to professionnal teachers and to anyone concerned with education, both from a theoretical and practical point of view.

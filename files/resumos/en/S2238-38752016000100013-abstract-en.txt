Abstract In this interview with British sociologist Huw Beynon, author of Working for Ford, the dynamics of his intellectual trajectory, the institutional development of sociology (of labor, specially), British politics and Marxist tradition are entwined. The author reflects on an extensive involvement in setting up and advancing critical sociology, focused on engaging with its object and extra academic audience. We highlight his practice in adult education and "extra mural" activities with workers, the first expressions of globalization and neoliberalism as a "closure movement" of factories - and the academic and trade union reactions - as well as recent political and cultural responses towards the preservation of labor identity and the reconstruction of the Labour Party around youth membership. The interview with Huw Beynon summarizes a body of work that is as much inseparable of the changes in the world of labor over the past fifty years as is priceless to its sociological understanding.

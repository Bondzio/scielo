Abstract  Abstract: By focusing on the musical styles known as bossa nova and afrobeat, I ask: Given that globalisation/capitalism promotes exchange, borrowing, and imitation, can we make sense of &#8216;authenticity&#8217;? Can we speak of an authentically Brazilian or Nigerian music? If today &#8216;authenticity&#8217; makes little sense, why is talk about &#8216;authenticity&#8217; so pervasive? If we expose &#8216;authenticity&#8217; as reification, do we still need this term? What, then, may &#8216;authenticity&#8217; mean? How can we restrict powerful musical cultures without limiting localities to replicating the past? How can cultures take up each others&#8217; vitality without losing their particularity? Can we imagine a world stage inviting all music? I explore the astonishing but mostly uncharted flows between and within musical traditions. At the same time, I seek to ground those flows in locales. Moving somewhat against the grain of contemporary social theory, I retrieve the need for &#8216;reification&#8217; and &#8216;authenticity&#8217;. If we value a diverse world, we may wish to balance capitalism&#8217;s dominant flows with the desire to situate music-making in specific locales.

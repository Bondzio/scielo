ABSTRACT This article provides a set of indicators to evaluate the infrastructure of public elementary schools which provide primary and lower secondary education in Brazil. It assumes that infrastructure is a complex construct, which justifies its evaluation on multiple dimensions. It uses data of The School Census on basic education and the National Assessment System for Basic Education, from 2013 to 2015. The results show that the infrastructure improved during this period, but the patterns of inequality known in the literature remained. Rural, small, municipal schools in the North and Northeast regions have lower means for all indicators. There are positive associations between indicators of infrastructure and socioeconomic level and the Index of Development of Basic Education.

Abstract The objective of this paper is to suggest the interest students of religion have in examining the hypothesis of the present relevance of gnosis (and of gnosticism) based on the recent works of the writer Harold Bloom. At the same time, we look at the possibilities raised by this author&#8217;s work in confrontation with the works of other authors, some questions from contemporary thought and recent studies on &#8220;new religious movements&#8221; which permit us to consider new developments or reformulations.

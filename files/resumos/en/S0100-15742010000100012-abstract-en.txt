This work focuses on the school as a place for teachers education. It analyses the context of a successful school in the Campo Grande municipal system, in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. The article describes its characteristics, with emphasis on the school management and the school climate. Teachers and managers were interviewed about the school, its organization and management as well as about the way these dimensions affect their work and the studentsâ performance. By examining the interviews, it was possible to build up some of the categories that define the ethos of the school: the fact of it being small, team-work, democratic relationships and commitment to the students. The analysis highlights the professionalism of the management and its prospective vision of the educational task, which encourages the teachers to face up to the challenges and shares with them ways of overcoming the difficulties. It points out the importance of the network of relationships that are established within the context of the school as a way of socializing the profession, constructing a teaching identity and establishing a place were teachers can learn starting with teaching practice.

This study, in the human sciences area, aims to verify if authors of abstracts attempt, in their texts, to understand the features of this discursive genre and if they show self-regulated ability to do so. First, twenty-four abstracts written by master degree students of a federal university were analyzed. In order to better express the results, an instrument of analysis and quantitative considerations was construed. From the twenty-four abstracts analyzed, five were considered compatible with a written production, as they expressed semantic properties of reading and discursive organization; thirteen abstracts did not present the expected features; and, the other six had serious problems, such as plagiarizing the original work. These analyzes were based on the construct of self-regulation of learning and discursive linguistic theories.

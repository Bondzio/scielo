In this article I discuss the subjectivity of the storytellers from the Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay border , where I do ethnographic research since 1997. Initially I dedicate to analyzing the role that narrative performances have in the construction of subjectivity, based on the observation that most of the storytellers narrated events are about rupture or breakage of everyday normality. In this sense, the "conflict" concept is adopted as a key element to reflect about the storytellersÂ´s life trajectories. Secondly, I do a survey of the conflict situations, under different contexts, presents in the personal narratives of the storytellers. Finally, I consider the importance of narrative performances in organizing the experience of becoming a person in this border zone.

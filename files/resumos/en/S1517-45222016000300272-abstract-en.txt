Abstract In this article, we examine the role of digital media in youth participation and subcultures through two interrelated case studies: protest rap and illegal graffiti. The internet and other digital technologies not only have given voice to these groups, supporting alternative formats and channels of expression and communication, but also contributed to aggregate individual efforts around the same interests and activities. The findings presented are based on different research projects conducted over a period of about ten years, in Portugal, using qualitative methods (participant observation, in-depth interviews and methodologies of visual collection), both in urban contexts and on the internet, integrating them in an ethnographic research strategy offline and online. We wish, firstly, to deepen the theoretical debate on the theme of youth subcultures, participation and digital media, secondly, to briefly present a summary of findings of the research projects carried out.

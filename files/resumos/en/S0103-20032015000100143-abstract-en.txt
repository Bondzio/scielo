With the emergence of the concept of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM), forest agro-industries have been pressured to make decisions based on principles of sustainability, driving all the supply chain players toward forest certification. In Brazil, a process that mirrors this moment is happening in the Agroindustrial System of Acacia Negra. This is, however, in a complex context, implying ambiguous and risky decisions in the context of forest ecosystems. Thus, we propose the following question: what strategic actions forest producers are adopting, and how they relate to the risks in the Acacia agroindustrial system? The goal is to analyze the development and implementation of strategic actions that promote or discourage sustainable self-organization of the system (i.e. forest certification). The theoretical foundation starts with a systemic oriented perspective to the study of organizations and sustainable strategies. It integrates discussions more specifically related to the decision-making, strategies and risks within the rural property. Post-Normal science was the methodology used, following a qualitative approach. As a result, we identified that strategic actions adopted by forest producers are dialogically related to the risks and can have complementary, competitive and even antagonistic influences.

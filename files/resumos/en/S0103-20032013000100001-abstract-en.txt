The aim of the article is to compare food distribution systems in different countries. For this purpose, a review of previous studies available was made. Specifically: i) identification of demand patterns and analysis of characteristics of the food market; ii) analysis of relations between the structure of the food retail systems and the economic, social, cultural and prevailing purchasing patterns and iii) identification of strategies adopted by retailers. Countries studied were: high income (the United States and the United Kingdom); with upper-middle income (South Africa and Brazil); lower-middle income (China and Guatemala) and low income (Vietnam and Madagascar). Results show that there are important differences in the development of food retailing among studied countries. Furthermore, they also indicate that the quality and variety of the products are important factors in the retailing strategy in high income and upper-middle income countries, while in lower-middle and low income countries, food prices have particular importance. The main implication of this study is the impact which supermarket causes on all food chain stages.

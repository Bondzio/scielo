Abstract: The aim of this study is to propose a systematization of several variables that contribute to the evaluation of purchases from family farming for school feeding, presenting results for Paraná, Santa Catarina and São Paulo. This is based on the assessment of the efficiency of the Public Calling (CPs) to achieve the desired and effective public to contribute to higher purchases of family farmers (households) and increase consumption by students of fresh and less processed products, also the relative effectiveness of the effects on income and organization of farmers. Data were collected from CPs, supply contracts and municipalities accounts. It was found that compliance with legislation is growing, although the potential number of family farmers is relatively small in most municipalities. In the contracts, the prices are higher than in conventional markets and in natura or less processed products predominate among purchases, favoring school and family farmers. However, in several cases the CPs have weaknesses, such as lack of information, the frequency and the number of delivery locations and the prices to be paid, which affects the organization of households and process efficiency. It was observed encouragement to the increase of legal formality and the organization of farmers.

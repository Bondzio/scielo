ABSTRACT This paper delves into the diverse ways in which teacher development is currently conceptualized. A large bibliographical corpus allows to appreciate how diverse the positions concerning initial teacher development are, as well as the changes teachers should experience in order to improve their teaching practices. Besides the corpus there is another dimension concerning the discourse about teaching practice and professional development issued from its own actors, addressed neither to researchers nor to authorities. The mutual invisibility of those places of discourse production lays down the path for this paper, going further than simply accepting the existence of both discourse modes in order to understand them, as productions of a place that at the same time allows and forbids.

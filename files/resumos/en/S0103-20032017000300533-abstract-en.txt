Abstract: The purpose of this article is to analyze the lease of the BR-163 highway, considering the possible implications on the competitiveness of soybean transport in the state of Mato Grosso. This proposition is justified especially because the toll, a priori, represents cost to the road transport and any additional expense to it may compromise the profit margin. This research was subsidized by bibliographical and documentary revision, using the descriptive research method. The main components of the cost of road transport and the impact of the highway leased on the competitiveness of the sector were identified. Thus, a comparative analysis of the cost of soybean transportation in paid highways (leased) and the cost savings that are inherent to this modality of transportation, due to the excellent condition of asphaltic paving, was performed. To carry out this verification, and to counter toll costs, three variables were listed: (i) the economy with fuel, (ii) the economy with the operating cost of trucks and (iii) the economy that is made in smaller losses of soybean grains. The results found after the quantification of economic variables showed positive impact, with economic benefits for the state of Mato Grosso.

Abstract In this paper, the author examines the sociology of Jos√© de Souza Martins by focusing on his theoretical perspective and dialectical method. Martins addresses what is on the edge of society and the Social Sciences, which includes, for instance, the fate of rural people, the dreams of workers in large cities, the apparition of the devil in a factory, and the everyday life of ordinary men. Disciple of Florestan Fernandes, Martins establishes a dialog with Marx and Lefebvre from whom two essential notions are taken: those of capital loss and residue. The author of this article points out that these two notions, seemingly insignificant, are key to understanding the contribution of Martins. In Martins' Sociology, what is in on the edge is not just a theme, but it is also and primarily a methodological resource.

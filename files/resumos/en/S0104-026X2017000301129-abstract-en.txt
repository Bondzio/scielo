Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the novel Da √çndia, com amor, by Julia Nery. Therefore, it is appropriate to insert the author within the canon of contemporary Portuguese historical novel, according to Miguel Real considerations. In the sequel, we list some relationships between post-colonized nations and the imperialist assumptions related to Western nations, according to the cultural studies presented by Edward Said. The central idea is to show how the author, in her rewriting of the history, has given voice and action to female characters, which are somewhat evidenced by official history, by bringing to the fore the history of Portuguese women. They were adjuvants in maritime expansion, more specifically, in the way to India. However, we observe that the novel presents female body condition related to other forms of action, or &#8220;bargaining chip&#8221; of the imperialist Portuguese government in order to strengthen its foreign affairs.

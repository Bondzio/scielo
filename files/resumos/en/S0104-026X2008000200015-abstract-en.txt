Bioethics was consolidated in Brazil at the end of the 1990s. A similar phenomenon occurred in other countries in Latin America, especially in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico. In this consolidation process, women assumed different roles: sometimes as bioethics academic protagonists, and sometimes as bioethics interlocutors in the public sphere. This dual insertion is the trademark of the women in Latin American bioethics and is part of the biography of the authors of this essay. This essay is a biographical and genealogical narrative of Latin American, and specifically, of Brazilian bioethics. The common thread of this narrative is our experiences in this dual role as academic protagonists and as bioethics political speakers.

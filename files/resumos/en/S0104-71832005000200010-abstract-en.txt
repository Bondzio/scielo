What does it mean performance art? What does it make a performance artist to think, be and act as such? In this text, I will try to answer these questions in a somewhat elliptic fashion, as if it were a poetic essay of a performer standing over the map of performance art in the new century, as I perceive it. In order to be consistent with my own aesthetic practice, at the same time that I attempt to answer these thorny questions, I will constantly cross the frontiers between theory and chronicle; between the frightening fields of the personal and the social ( between "I" and "we"), hoping to discover some interesting bridges and crossroads. I will write with all possible passion, value and clarity though the sliding nature and constant transformation of this 'field' make it extremely difficult to come with simplistic definitions.

This article analyzes the construction processes on the project The Queer Face, created by the visual artist and researcher Milena Costa. The paper proposes to develop a 'self theory' through a reflective writing, which (re) thinks the self and permeates through the different stages of the artistic creation in question. Some of the results arising from the artistic experience are presented, contributing to a reflection on the relationship between visual poetics and its dialogues with references from feminist and queer theories.

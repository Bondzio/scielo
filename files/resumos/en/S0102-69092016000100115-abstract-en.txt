In everyday situations, the experience of being a vegetarian occurs within a process of conflict and practices of negotiation involving decisions, refusals, consumption acts, and proximity and distance between people in their relationships. In order to understand the trajectory of those who opt for vegetarianism, their motivations and everyday conflicts in situations of social interaction, the article uses self-ethnography (systematic observation of the conflict situation experienced by the researcher) and interviews with selected vegetarians with different alimentary restrictions.

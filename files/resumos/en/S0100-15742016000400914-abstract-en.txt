Abstract A generalized linear model was adjusted to the probability of the Brazilian population to acquire reading materials based on data from the National Household Budget Survey of 2008-09 of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE. The explanatory variables were age, gender, years of schooling, being a student, family income, schooling of the head of the household, and a geographic indicator. The dependent variable was the event of the acquisition of various kinds of reading materials. The main finding was the discontinuity in the probability of acquisition of reading material as a function of years of schooling: persons with at least one year of higher education differ from others. Another important factor is the access to such reading material through marketing channels. The effect of a student in the family seems to be restricted only to textbooks. The study confirms results observed by other authors: the differentials between the sexes, even when controlled for socioeconomic level, education and age.

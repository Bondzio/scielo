This study is part of a line of research on Gender and Prevention in a research program on the social construction of HIV/AIDS. From a political and relational approach this line researches in gender relations, roles and identities in the context of the daily life. This paper analyses sexual initiation and some dimensions of the sexual practices of young people, including their sexual care and social representations related with AIDS. From a critical point of departure to the universalist and naturalized constructions of youth and young people we focus on how practices and meanings are constructed by young people in particular contexts of interaction. We propose that self sexual care and prevention of HIV/AIDS depend on a complex in which play gender identities and roles of sort, the modalities of power relations and social asymmetries in the access and control of material and symbolic resources. The data come from an ethnographic study between low-income young people, women and men from 15 to 28 years old in the southern area of the City of Buenos Aires.

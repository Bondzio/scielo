Abstract From the reading of two contemporary novels (K. - Relato de uma busca, of Bernardo Kucinski, and Hist√≥ria natural da ditadura, of Teixeira Coelho), this essay analyses the relation of recent Brazilian fiction to Historical facts in the context of Military Dictatorship. It will be argued that these two novels express two different approaches to the challenge of dealing with the reality of violence and repression: one adopting the lens of the subjective testimony and the other to the rescue of material elements of History's recursive structures.

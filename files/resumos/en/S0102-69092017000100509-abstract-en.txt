This article aims to discuss the pacification policy, active in the State of Rio de Janeiro since 2008, not as a public security&#8217;s police strategy, but in the sense of its effects in the associative structure of the city. A significant characteristic of this policy was the intensification of public investments destined to partnerships with civil society actors. In this context, I propose an analysis of the relationship between two important figures in 1990s Rio de Janeiro and in the beginning of the next decade: José Júnior, leader of the cultural group AfroReggae, and Pastor Marcos Pereira of the church Assembly of God of the Last Days (Assembleia de Deus dos Últimos Dias &#8211; ADUD). Thus, I seek to demonstrate that the urban social entanglement creates situational and circumstantial associations and dissociations. It is also analyzed &#8220;the work of time&#8221;, as discussed by Veena Das, in the creation of a choreography of the actors in the urban schemes of the Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s peripheries. In addition, I seek to analyze the way in which variable styles of articulation are evidenced in time, considering the composition of the actors in connection, the production of conflicts, and its territorial inscription.

This article explains and discusses the particulars of the relationship men and women (students and teachers) maintain with the school and how the different disciplines and the meanings of these relations appear in their schooling histories. The information is based on reports in the literature, in autobiographies and in reports of the intellectual training of already active students and teachers. It intends, with analysis, to propose new ways of favorable training to knowledge and thus getting beyond conceptions that these relationships are contaminated by vague attributes, such as an interest or disinterest in students.

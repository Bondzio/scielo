This paper revisits the literature on media and gender studies in search of works that help to discuss the case of Brazilian soap operas. A series of references coming from different theoretical perspectives, with emphasis in different countries and historical periods, bring up ideas and concepts that approach the contemporary desire to connect, to participate and to interact in terms conventionally associated to the female domain. Examples from specific soap operas suggest the ways in which these prime time daily soaps blend documentary and fiction conventions and treat the Brazilian nation in melodramatic terms. In doing so, soap operas have expanded what was conventionally treated as the female domain.

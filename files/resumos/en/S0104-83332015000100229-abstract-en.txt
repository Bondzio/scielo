This article studies the reception of Second Wave American and French feminism in Argentina, their translation and appropriation process; and the reports, news and interviews about Argentinean feminist organizations and women and homosexuals situation under the military dictatorship, published in French feminist journals during the 70s. I propose to reflect on the circulation of knowledge, skills and practices among feminisms, the creation of transnational networks and local projects, and the introduction of Human Rights discourse and gender perspective into political struggles.

The organization of schooling and the school culture are discussed in relation to the introduction of social promotion by learning cycles, particularly in public school systems. This relationship is constructed to substantiate the statement that is necessary to overcome the dichotomy established on the discourse of teachers, policy-makers and even politicians, as well as general population, on the quality of education, as far as regards the organization of the school into grades or learning cycles with social promotion. This study aims to indicate the need to eliminate the dichotomy which is often present in this issue, and to argue in favor of overcoming it in order to build more democratic school for all and for everyone

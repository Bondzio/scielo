In order to demonstrate the applicability of the Index, two parks of São Paulo city were selected - Buenos Aires Park and José Emérito Brás Park - and also primary and secondary data were used. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposition and application of this Index in two parks of São Paulo, where it was possible to obtain a diversified range of ecosystem services considered relevant for the health of the population.

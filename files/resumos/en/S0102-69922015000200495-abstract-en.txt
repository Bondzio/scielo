AbstractThe debate about development in Latin America and Brazil in particular was marked as one of the prominent themes in the socio-political thought and the Brazilian economy. The interpretations of Brazil from the theme of development gain strength from the 1930s, however, will be after the Second World War with the intensification of industrialization and modernization of the Brazilian capitalist society that the subject acquires centrality in sociology / political science. Moreover, discussions about the State and development are closely linked to the development of Brazilian capitalism, i.e., sets a triad simultaneously characterize both a type historically determined State, as well as a particular kind of economic and social development of the country . The development in Brazil is characterized by a clash between the Market and the State, and the influence of the latter foundational to the development pattern desired in the country. Let's analyze the development process as a way to revisit the conceptual and theoretical debate on the subject produced in Brazil, as well as analyze the historical movement-economic and political whereby Brazil adopted as strategies for development in the 1990s.

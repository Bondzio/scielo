Abstract This paper inquires on the &#8220;conservative twist&#8221; and it impact on travestis&#8217; lives in Argentina. In this regard, two moral images are analysed: the permitted travesti and the narcotravesti. The former represents those who struggled for a dignified work within an abolitionist paradigm. The latter, on the contrary, was recently crystalized in a sentence that sent a Peruvian travesti to prison for drug dealing, considering the fact of her being foreigner as an aggravating circumstance. The narcotravesti image was widely spread by the media, informing the rise in police repression and the stigmatization of migrant people. The analysis of these two images contribute to explore, on the one hand, the moral and political intersections that constrain the limits of the possible and acceptable for travestis; and, on the other, the configuration of specific vulnerabilities within a repressive context.

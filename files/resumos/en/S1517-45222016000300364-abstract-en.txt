Abstract This article builds a typology of mobbing, considering the context, power, corporate culture and strategies, based on Bourdieu&#8217;s theory. It aims to unveil corporate responsibility by reflecting on business strategies, nuclei of power, conflict over rights between employer and employees, and on practices and organizational habitus. Its construction was based on a qualitative study on mobbing inquiries in Colombia, collected from both the legal system and prevention institutions; the study also resorted to semi-structured interviews with victims, judicial officials, employers and unions. Findings point to the need to establish corporate responsibility in mobbing practices, as a focus of theoretical and empirical discussions on this phenomenon.

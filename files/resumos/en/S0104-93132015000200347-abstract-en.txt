Abstract This article explores the different reconstructions of a prominent episode concerning the struggle of rural workers in the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Norte. My concern is with how Union members who occupied different positions in relation to the episode remember it. The article is based on a multi-sited ethnography: the places in which research was carried out were chosen by following the suggestions of people I spoke to, who guided me to certain locales in order to obtain the answers I was looking for. My interlocutors narrated histories, and the histories of those people linked by the suggestions that I followed revealed certain regularities. I consider the diverse entities that these histories construct and the different pasts that they refer to, and I stress the importance of social relations in their construction. I intend to ethnographically demonstrate that these histories not only reveal a content, but also a social dynamic.

Abstract This article discusses the concept of inscription through an examination of studies developed at the Integrated Command and Control Centre and at the Special Secretariat of Public Order - municipal and state public authorities, respectively, of the city and state of Rio de Janeiro. The text shows how the construction of this concept in these studies is informed by an underlying theoretical and methodological convergence between the conceptions of power in Michel Foucault and those posited by actor-network theory.

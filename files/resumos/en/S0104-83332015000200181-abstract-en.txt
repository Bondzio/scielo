AbstractBased on fieldwork carried out in Mozambique between 1981 and 1984 and through extensive analysis of data on women and gender relations, the author discusses the so-called development processes in Africa, taking in consideration their deployment in Mozambique and its effects on women. From the particular point of view of women's lives, development policies, carried out by FRELIMO, initially socialists and later neo-liberal, didn't make so much difference, which the author explores grounded in ethnographic material from various regions of the country.

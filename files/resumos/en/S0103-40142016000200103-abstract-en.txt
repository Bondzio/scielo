abstract This article presents the course of the Brazilian labor market since 2001, mainly through data from the Monthly Employment Survey, highlighting the macroeconomic conditions of its performance. The study is broken down into four main periods: the years of economic adjustment and the end of the post-crisis labor market of the 1990s and beginning of the Lula government; the virtuous period of economic growth, formal job creation and reduction of income inequality and poverty; the abatement of the booming trend of the previous period, due to the financial crisis of 2008/20009; and the onset of one of the most severe recessions in the history of the country, with particularly serious impact on the labor market.

ABSTRACT This article analyzes the social vulnerability theoretical category and presents the results of a survey conducted in the slums of Rio de Janeiro (RJ - BR). Based on studies about youth, social vulnerability and living conditions, we discuss the notion of social vulnerability with the participation of social projects educators, highlighting and analyzing the dimensions and indicators that guided the data collection: the investigation-action-participation - IAP - method. The results enabled us to verify that: 1) the qualitative approaches were positive for data collection and analysis of vulnerability; 2) the confirmation that the social exclusion category is the main condition of vulnerability, encompassing the social, ideological and legal and extreme/lethal dimensions.

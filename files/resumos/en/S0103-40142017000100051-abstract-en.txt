Abstract This paper argues that the Brazilian economic crisis of 2014-2017 is a result of a combination of economic policies that reduced Brazil's potential economic growth and of a fiscal crisis that led to unsustainable growth of public sector debt. Brazil will only be able to resume its growth once it solves the fiscal problem. The country's current huge overcapacity will sustain an initial recovery and boost economic growth during the first years. However, in order to increase long-term GDP growth, the Brazilian economy requires productivity-enhancing policies.

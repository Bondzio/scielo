Conducted from the cultural study perspective, this study enables identifying the profile of these students in the specific dimension of a written text reception and production domain. Data refer to students attending the last year of a private higher basic education teacher education program, in an institution located in a city in the State of Sao Paulo, in 2005. With Sociology contributions, this study tries to critically understand this present education model, analyzing it from inside the educational institutions and their agents. Results point out deficiencies in mastering basic school contents such as reading and writing, indispensable for the future practice of teaching first graders of primary school.

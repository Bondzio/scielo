Abstract This paper draws on the historical process of construction of the modus operandis of development practices in order to understand the role of international organizations in mobilizing the resources necessary for the consolidation of the field of international cooperation. The analysis focuses on the aftermath of the Pearson Commission (1969), which goal was to make recommendations for future operation of international development practices. The main finding is that although both World Bank and UN shared the understanding that international aid was crucial to fight global inequality, they offered different agendas to solve the problem of underdevelopment. The paper concludes that the victorious agenda was the one supported by the World Bank, influencing the development cooperation dynamics afterwards.

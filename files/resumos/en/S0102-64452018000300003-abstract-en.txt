Abstract Who designs public policies? The public policy literature indicates that its producers are public administrators as well as epistemic and specialists communities. On the limits between this field and social movements, this article postulates that these movements are not only challengers of the status quo, but can also be proponents of alternatives to public policies. For such, it discusses and articulates three analytical categories: social innovation, alternative, and public policy instrument, which helps to clarify the actions of movements that seeks to transform their political objectives into public policies. Next, we apply this analytical scheme to three social movements - the children and adolescents movement, the human rights movement and the health movement. We show how the articulation between these three concepts contributes to the reconstruction of the process referring to social movement&#8217;s origins of public policies.

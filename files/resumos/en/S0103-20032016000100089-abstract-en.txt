Abstract: Starting from the perception of the Brazilian food industry (IAA) importance as a job generator, this work analyses the variations of the number of employees in this sector from 1996 to 2012. By applying the shift share analysis (SSA), it was possible to verify which effects are responsible for the changing number of employees. The effects used in this paper were provided by the most complete and modern versions of the SSA, and the national, structural market competitive and specialized competitive effects, as well as homothetic decomposition and residual of each one. This paper took into consideration Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil, except Esp√≠rito Santo. The database was also segmented, covering sectors that compose the IAA. The results indicate that the number of employees at IAA fluctuated because of the national effect, in other words, followed the national industry's flow without presenting any other differential in its structure or competitive strategy, which could be identified in the current analysis.

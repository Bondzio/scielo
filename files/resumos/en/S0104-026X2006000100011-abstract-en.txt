This work approaches the thematic of discrimination and racism among carioca youth, through the analysis of the insights, experiences and reactions of the group before prejudicial situations. The study integrates a broader research about the effects of social interventions in the trajectories of young males and females from the popular layers. Hence, meaningful interviews have been made with 42 youths aged 18 through 24, with and without the participation in projects concerned with the citizenship and professional capacitation. Herein we have privileged the analysis of the youths' talks about the circuits, the networks and the processes that involve the discriminatory practices in Rio de Janeiro city. We emphasize the configurations that discrimination and racism assume among young males with experience in social projects and their implication for the sociability and access to certain social spaces. The comparative perspective among youths with and without institutional experience has given interesting insights on race, class and gender, thus broadening the understanding of the racial relations specificities in Brazil.

 Subjective constitution in our contemporary society must be addressed within the complex web of intersubjective relations, and from different theoretical formulations. The construction of the subject involves consideration of the existence of the "other", who gives meaning to his/her existence, and to the construction/acquisition of social / collective identities. This process is addressed in terms of social representations, as an expression of common sense, which develops through complex processes involving long-range stability and antinomies - themata - which define situations of tension as inherent characteristics in the evolution of common sense. Four psychosocial processes were considered herein: 1) Identity as an intersubjective product. 2) Social representation as an expression of identity. 3) Themata as constitutive of social representations. 4) Symbolic interdependence I/Other. This is illustrated with examples from two investigations, in Ciers-ed and in Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina

Employers' perceptions of men and women at work has a significant effect on the possibilities of them gaining access to employment, and on their work conditions. The article analyzes the results of a research based on a survey made of 203 companies in Chile and on 17 in depth interviews. One of the main conclusions is that what can best explain the negative or positive opinion of employers about women is an a priori definition of the characteristics of different occupations. Such "pre definition" has little to do with thecnical or organizational elements of the occupations, but rather to the masculine or feminine character socially attributed to them. We are therefore dealing with mechanisms constituting a gender order, which characterizes and classifies certain kinds of companies and occupations as more or less suitable for men or women, defining male and female territories in the world of work.

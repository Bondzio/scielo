The development of graduate-level human resources in the space area in Brazil began in the 1960's, in the National Institute for Space Research. In order to build a team of specialists to develop its activities, the institute was initially supported by a structure that both sent researchers abroad and created graduate programs. This paper presents graduate course activities in the institute, especially in the 1960's and 1970's, with the purpose of analyzing the strategies adopted to build its graduate studies center. We also present a picture of the students that have completed the Astrophysics and Space Geophysics programs until 2005, with the purpose of identify and analyze part of the results obtained by this education center.

This paper presents a reading of environmental conflicts as cultural, social and political laboratories in which protestors start to rework ideas, values and their worldviews. Focusing on the analysis of the conflict from below, we have paid special attention to the individual experiences of members of the affected communities. This is because we want to capture the innermost dimension of the resistance. Based on analysis of three cases of conflict against dams in Spain and Mexico, we will present the outcomes of these experiences at the micro and meso levels, in three main dimensions, territorial, biographical and political. About methodology, the research design includes depth interviews and narrative analysis of the biographical material. This paper will attempt to contribute to the understanding of the cultural processes that lead to the changes of beliefs and attitudes and that allow to demonstrate that environmental conflicts are experiences of emancipation.

In this paper, we investigate the construction of interdisciplinary practices of education and research based on the dialogue between primary schools and universities. We present some human and non-human agents responsible for the interaction established on school grounds, taken as a complex research field. The results show that the constitutive complexity assumption can be of help in understanding the functioning of teaching situations, avoiding simplified and precipitated diagnosis, which makes it difficult to solve the real problems in the teachers' preparation contexts.

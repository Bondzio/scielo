Abstract This study aims to evaluate the shelter program for women under threat of death in Pernambuco, trying to understand how the service works in combating violence against women. The evaluation refers to the period between 2013 and the first half of 2014, based on quantitative data provided by the Department of Women from Pernambuco and qualitative data as interviews and participant observation. What checks is a difference between the program design and its implementation, which does not mean a failure, in that its institutional strengthening was found.

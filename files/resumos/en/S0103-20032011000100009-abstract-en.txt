The bovine livestock is one of the most important sectors in the Brazilian agribusiness. However, Brazilian herds' health - very important for the activity - is still an issue rarely studied in economic terms. Therefore, the present study tried to identify the major determinants of the use of preventive measures established in the National Program for Control and Eradication of Animal Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (PNCEBT). For this, a Panel Tobit model was used. Results show that the effective beginning of PNCEBT in 2004, has significantly stimulated the increase of measures' use. It was also observed that vaccination is not influenced by the prices paid both for meat and milk, but those affected positively the number of tuberculosis tests. Variables related to federal government transfer, by agreement, to states and meat or milk exports were not significant. It was concluded that the PNCEBT has been showing good results. Moreover, economic incentives can be planned for producers, aiming to stimulate the increase in preventive practices.

Abstract This article provides elements to think coordination as a government technique. From two fieldworks carried out at the CICC (Integrated Center for Command and Control) and SEOP (Special Secretariat of Public Order) in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Whereas the CICC and SEOP produced some of the most important transformations in Public Security and Order Urban in recent years in this city, it is significant coordination&#8217;s centrality. Coordination emerges in SEOP through the construction of a new institutional design, articulating the work of secretaries, coordinators and authorities that already existed to produce effects in the production of urban order. At the CICC, coordination results from efforts to integrate information by building a large informational and control system in order to respond quickly to daily needs and critical events.

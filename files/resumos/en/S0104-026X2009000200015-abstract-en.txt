This article analyses the statements related to motherhood that configure what we call motherhood "norm". We follow Foucault's theory, mainly in reference to genealogy as a way to think about the present. The analysis was conducted mainly on working mothers' life trajectories description. This research material allowed us to question some statements that constitute contemporary motherhood. We described the intensification of the investment in a woman pattern as the result of motherhood norm. This norm, although socially produced is naturalized nowadays. It works determining some characteristics that configure the good way to be mother, as such: correct time to be a mother (age), number of children, and financial conditions. As an effect of the norm we have an evaluation and hierarchization of different ways of being a mother.

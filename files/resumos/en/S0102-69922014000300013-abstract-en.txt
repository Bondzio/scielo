This article seeks to discuss the Brasilia's potential to be part in the worldwide network of cities, because of its peculiar socioeconomic and cultural dynamics. It consolidates here, after 54 years of its inauguration, a city that lives constant processes of change, but it is still attached to the public sector as the sphere that gives its identity. The asymmetry that is observed between its role as a rational city which repels a modernist design and its role as a city that grows in its peripheries in an anarchical way reproducing models of other Brazilian cities, pushes a social structures with huge degrees of inequality and differentiation. Contextualizing it in the contemporary logic of "global" cities, in which the urbane policy is part of a general movement common to other worldwide metropolises, the city seeks to offer some comparative benefits in order to attract investments. In this sense, this article defends that Brasilia today lives an original stage in its evolution, besides its apparent incompatibility between its function as the political capital that in a certain way restricts its potentialities, and its market forces that leads to modify its original nature.

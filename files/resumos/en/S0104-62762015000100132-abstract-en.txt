This article aims to identify the variables associated to the Brazilian population trust in the country's Armed Forces. The main source of data is a national survey conducted by Ipea in 2011 through the research project "System of Indicators of Social Perception", with focus on defense and security issues. By organizing the survey data in the light of the literature on the subject, we built up a set of independent variables, whose impact on confidence was then tested using a model of ordinal regression. The main conclusion is that, despite prevails a high level of confidence in the military among all strata of the population, that trust is impacted differently according to socioeconomic and regional conditions, as well as the perception of individuals about the legitimacy and effectiveness of specific public policies.

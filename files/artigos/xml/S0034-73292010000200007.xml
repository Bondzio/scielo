<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For centuries there    has been resistance to both elitist rule and imperialism in Brazil. Elites have    traditionally sided with foreign interests while subaltern classes have rarely    found grounds to make al.ances with the middle classes and elitist groups. In    the last four decades economic change has transformed Brazil into a modern and    complex society, producing a strong and powerful new social movement as well    as a new and independent elite. These new classes have found ways to fede their    interests through actions and ideas that indicate the formation of a counter-hegemonic    project for Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For these classes    the main issue and the first step to overcome backwardness is to reduce the    country's comparative disadvantages when compared to other developed regions    of the global capitalist system by, reforming and strengthening the State. This    aim has been pursued by following a number of initiatives that - at least in    general terms - have been supported by different sectors of Brazilian political    spectrum.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first and most    important initiative is substituting Brazil's patrimonialist and aristocratic    society and State for a democratic one. Secondly, and in order to create regional    integration in all levels, Brazil and South American countries have been engaged    in bi-national and multi-national cooperation. Thirdly, Brazil has taken a set    of initiatives to enhance regional trade and upgrade the importance of South    American markets. Finally, Brazil has become increasingly active in international    fora.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our discussion    will be limited to the ideas and initiatives of counter-hegemony associated    mainly with the political changes that have lately taken place in Brazil and    have led the country to seek a central role in South American politics since    the beginning of its transition to democracy. The main sources of these ideas    are in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo. Mainly the powerful S&atilde;o Paulo Industry    Federation (FIESP), S&atilde;o Paulo University (USP) and the new unionists    associated with the Workers' Party. The State's elite has also played a major    role in channelling these ideas into actions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before introducing    and discussing the counter-hegemonic views expressed by the new left wing movement    in Brazil and by the Brazilian State's elite and its business elite, it is important    to state that they represent the two main sources of counter-hegemonic thinking    and action in Brazil. One is linked to the emergence to the Workers' Party (PT)    and the new unionists in the city of S&atilde;o Paulo. They are the source of    the debate on grassroots democracy, on participatory budgeting, the debate that    created the World Social Forum in the city of Porto Alegre. A set of new views    that are part of the a new left wing counter-hegemonic agenda that has deeply    influenced changes all over Brazil and South America.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The other source    is associated with the views of the Brazilian business community and the State    bureaucratic elite. Their interests have led them to participate in initiatives    to fede an alternative regional project to the neoliberal version supported    by the US and Europe. The search for cooperation with Argentina, the formation    of Mercosur, the growth of regional trade and the emergence of South American    multinationals - mainly Brazilian - are some of the most important initiatives    and goals emerging from this group. They aim at guaranteeing recognition that    Brazil has a well-established business community with a regional project of    its own and thus corresponds to a emerging sub-system in global society.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article shows    how these changes have unfolded and argues that the policies produced by these    initiatives have become elements in the formation of Brazil's counter-hegemonic    view.<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Worker&acute;s    Party counter-hegemony</b><a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup><b>2</b></sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The emergence of    the Workers' Party (PT) in Brazil was a major attempt to fede a new hegemonic    model for Brazil. The PT has been deeply involved with key changes Brazil has    gone through in the last two decades. These changes have produced an important    set of policies that have influenced other South American nations.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>a) The New Unionists</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new unionist    movement was based on the metal-workers union of S&atilde;o Paulo and grew with    the wave of strikes during the military regime. The idea of the PT was later    launched by the metal-workers leadership headed by today's President Luis In&aacute;cio    Lula da Silva. At first it was received with mistrust by the traditional Brazilian    left and right wings. Only a few radical left groups hailed it with enthusiasm.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the main    characteristics of the counter-hegemonic thinking and action of the new Unionists    and the PT are the following:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Firstly, they denounced    traditional bureaucratic and authoritarian control of the State-driven union    system by both the Brazilian traditional right and left wings. And in doing    this they proposed and constructed an independent and legitimate union movement    that led to the formation of the <i>Central &Uacute;nica dos Trabalhadores</i>,    CUT. This represented itself as a revolution against the submissive relationship    the unions had previously had in relation to the State and towards the use made    of of the union movement by traditional right or left wing groups that glorified    the state apparatus as the source of power and the means to social control.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The CUT resulted    from the search for a democratic and liberal practice for the movement. After    destroying the state monopoly of the unions, it provoked the end of the Brazilian    fascist-type unified union system and the adoption of freedom of edanization    by the union movement. Contrary to the argument from the traditional elite that    the liberalization of the union system would weaken and destroy its influence,    today national union edanizations such as the CUT and <i>For&ccedil;a Sindical</i>    are independent from the State, are powerful and work together on many important    national issues.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secondly, the formation    of the PT contributed to the destruction of the elitist party system, based    on individual or aristocratic interests, that dominated national politics. The    PT became the first mass party in Brazil by proposing and creating a democratic,    grassroots based edanization with a clear set of principles and program for    gaining power and changing Brazil's social and political order.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirdly, as the    PT developed its ideology, it created a set of proposals for counter-hegemony    that became a national, regional and international reference point in the debate    on alternative projects to the dominant neo-liberalism. These are: a) the introduction    of direct democracy in city administration based on popular councils as alternative    channels to make decisions and implement changes; b) a new republicanism, recognizing    new rights and bringing excluded social sectors into political participation;    c) participatory budgeting, involving community in decisions concerning public    investments; d) new social policies such as actions taken by the Federal Government    to promote anti-AIDS policies in Brazil. These proposals were widely adopted    in the administration of major Brazilian cities by elected PT majors and have    expanded to other levels of the Federation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout the    1990s, the PT's successive periods spent in local governments transformed both    the party itself and Brazilian politics, long characterized by patronage, personalism    and by the lack of public participation. Once in power, the PT broadened its    relation with civil society by decentralizing decisions and creating opportunities    for public participation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, being    in power also forced the party to make difficult choices in its quest to advance    progressive platforms. Internal and external factors such as the State's fiscal    situation, preassures from local elites and electoral concerns (as well as from    the bases of the party) limited the scope of action for the admistrators. The    main problem at hand was how to deal with political demands on a grassroots    level without jeopardizing the party's ability to govern. One lesson drawn from    the first PT administrations was that where broad participatory programs were    successfully implemented, these programs helped city administrators cope with    the demands placed on them. Public participation provided a forum where claimants    themselves could be part of the negotiation of demands while generating legitimacy    and consensus for the party's redistributive platform.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The community councils    and the participatory budgeting first implemented in Porto Alegre served as    examples for many subsequent administrations. In its first four years of office,    the PT administration managed to balance municipal finances and incorporate    active participants into the decision-making process concerning investments.    Largely as a result of the success of these participatory initiatives involving    citizens, the administration was able to carry out a number of ambitious reforms,    such as introducing land-use taxes targeted at wealthier citizens that helped    fund many other projects.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Participatory budgeting    has evolved into a complex structure of gatherings where elected delegates from    neighborhood associations meet regularly to discuss, prioritize and monitor    the investments needed in each district. The projects include anything within    the scope of municipal government: street-paving, water, sewage, social services,    health care, housing, and primary and adult education. In addition, thematic    fora were created to debate city priorities that are not necessarily specific    to one district or neighborhood, such as culture and education, economic development,    or health. A higher-level financial council composed of two counselors from    each district and two for each of the thematic fora meets to fit the demands    into the yearly budget. At the end of the year the budget is passed to the city    council, where it is approved. When projects begin, citizens are responsible    for forming commissions to monitor the work.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Encouraging participation    in public spaces represents a threat to the separation between Brazil's centralized    power structure and its society. This new model of city governance has added    an important aspect to the PT's counter-hegemonic project.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>b) The Anti-AIDS    policy</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among a number    of important social policies that can be considered as anti-hegemonic is that    which led to the compulsory licensing of anti-AIDS medicines. This was a highly    controversial issue worldwide at the time of President Cardoso and Brazil played    an important role in changing views on this subject.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1996, Brazil's    national programme to combat AIDS has offered free access to medication to a    large number of HIV-positive people and the country is regarded as being a leader    in terms of policies on this issue. However, the cost of this comprehensive    policy had been increasingly high for the Federal Government. In 1999 alone,    it spent over R$ 620 million on anti-AIDS medicines. Less than 20% of the anti-retroviral    drugs were purchased directly from Brazilian public laboratories, and most of    them were imported.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For more than a    decade, starting in President Cardoso's first mandate, Brazil has been negotiating    with international laboratories to try to lower the cost of imported drugs and    has engaged in major disputes on that issue within the World Trade Edanisation.    On the one hand, powerful pharmaceutical companies have been putting pressure    on governments from developed countries to protect their patent rights. On the    other hand, developing countries, wishing to reduce the costs of imported drugs    and expand their AIDS policies, have been threatening to take advantage of compulsory    licensing to have access to these medicines and provide better and efficient    services to their citizens.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2001, after    negotiations at the World Health Edanisation, a resolution proposed by the Brazilian    delegation was adopted and access to anti-AIDS drugs was considered a human    right. The resolution also mentioned the need to reduce the cost of medication    and set up different import prices according to the level of development of    each country. Also, the US government agreed with Brazil that actions involving    compulsory licenses of American laboratories should be discussed before they    were implemented.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In May 2007, after    almost a year of discussions with Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, President Luis In&aacute;cio    Lula da Silva signed a historical decree that issued a compulsory license for    Efavirenz, allowing the import of a generic version of the drug. According to    the Government, this measure would allow a decrease of over 70% on the current    price of the medicine and the American laboratory would receive royalties of    1.5% on the imports of the Indian generic drug.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This decision received    both support and criticism worldwide. The Brazilian Government declared that    the compulsory license is a legal and legitimate instrument recognised by the    Trade-related Intellectual Property (TRIPs) agreement and that "the practice    of compulsory licensing for pharmaceutical products is frequently used both    by developed and developing countries. In the case of antiviral drugs, developing    countries already use that flexibility: Mozambique, Malaysia, Indonesia and,    more recently, Thailand<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a>.    The measure also reinforces the efforts of civil society groups fighting for    fairer access to medicines and for the sustainability of public health policies,    such as universal and unlimited access to antiretroviral medicines used in the    treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, the Brazil-US Business Council described the    action as "a major step backward" that would impact on international investment    in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initiatives such    as this attracted attention of international NGOs looking for alternative models    of governance. The creation of the World Social Forum (WSF) in the city of Porto    Alegre represented the recognition that the PT was a key actor in the creation    of an important counter-hegemonic model to dominant neo-liberal policies, a    model very much concerned with dealing with social and political situations    similar to that found in Brazil.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to its    charter, the WSF is</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"an open meeting      place for reflective thinking, democratic debate of ideas, formulation of      proposals, free exchange of experiences and interlinking for effective action      by groups and movements of civil society that are opposed to neoliberalism      and to domination of the world by capital and any form of imperialism, and      are committed to building a planetary society directed towards fruitful relationships      among Mankind and between it and the Earth".</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally,</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"The alternatives      proposed at the World Social Forum stand in opposition to a process of globalisation      commanded by the large multinational corporations and by the governments and      international institutions at the service of those corporations' interests,      with the complicity of national governments"<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The WSF has generated    a worldwide impact resulting in, for instance, a number of similar initiatives    taking place in Europe, Asia and Africa. In addition, a number of fora have    taken place in parallel to the WSF such as the World Judicial Forum and the    World Education Forum.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The WSF framework    gave the PT an opportunity to make known its political model based on direct    democracy, participatory budgeting and new republicanism. But the PT needed    political resources to produce and support initiatives at home and abroad to    incorporate the new model. This came with the victory of the PT in the Brazilian    Presidential elections in 2002.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The emergence of    the CUT and the PT in national politics was followed by the creation of an even    stronger rural movement called the MST (Landless Rural Workers' Movement). The    emergence of peasants and rural workers from a condition of dispossessed of    power and rights into political participation dates back to the 1950s Peasant    Leagues that were destroyed by the military regime. The MST has become a most    powerful and well-edanised social movement in Brazil. With the arrival of the    PT into power it has influenced the government to increase its policies in favour    of the have-nots, for agrarian reform and to fede and enhance the global anti-hegemonic    movement.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>c) President    Luis In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's Export of Social Policies</i></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Innovative social    policies were first adopted at national level throughout President Cardoso's    two terms. The <i>Bolsa escola</i> for instance, an allowance to help poor parents    keep their children at school, was federalized during his Presidency. Nevertheless    it was during President Luis In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's terms that successful    social policies were enlarged. His active foreign policy permitted Brazil to    successfully export some of Brazil's social policies and know-how to Haiti,    Africa and other parts of the world.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>Bolsa familia</i>    (family allowance) has been the centerpiece of Lula's social policies against    poverty and resulted from the unification of many cash tranfer programs. It    has produced the most important income transfer and poverty reduction in Brazil    ever, reaching about 44 million people. In its February 7th, 2008 issue, <i>The    Economist</i> properly described it as an anti-poverty scheme invented in Latin    America that is winning converts worldwide.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 2008 agreements    with the United States on cooperation in energy and biofuels, the many agreements    on agricultural technology with Africa and Central America demonstrated that    also technological policies, are part of a new set of assets that Brazil has    just begun to link to its foreign policy. Brazil's EMPRAPA, an agriculture research    institution, has an office in Africa where it contributes to the development    of small farmers as well as to the growth of commercial agriculture.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Haiti is perhaps    the key case where this set of policies can be applied to help overcoming one    of the direst problems of today's international politics: failed states. As    an alternative to occupation and food distribution, Brazil's actions in Haiti    have engaged the best of its social and development policies. If this proves    successful by making Haiti politically and economically sustainable, it will    shape a new counter-hegemonic model of dealing with international issues in    opposition to the old and ineffective stick and carrot method.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Brazilian    Elite&acute;s Responses</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In face of the    impact of the transformations associated with the democratization of South America,    Brazil's elite redefined its political proposals, which had been eroded by their    support for authoritarianism. It had two major options in its search for a new    identity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, there was    a move towards the new US hegemonic project. Dominant groups tried to open up    sectors of Brazilian economy and establish some sort of free trade agreement    with the US or Europe, believing this would help to alleviate high debt and    economic recession by incorporating the national economy into a stronger system.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Secondly, there    was a move towards the construction of a regional economic bloc. That bloc would    be established around key capitalist principles but would be aimed at creating    a regional economic and power centre along lines similar to those of Europe    or North America.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian elite,    made up of the business community and the nation's upper-middle-class, embraced    both projects. It first took shape with the election of President Collor de    Mello. He started opening up the Brazilian economy by reducing tariffs, thus    giving a competitive shock to the industrial sector. He also adopted a pro-US    position in order to foster a neo-liberal agenda. Accused of corruption, he    was impeached by Congress and his reformist proposals were partially shelved.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Sarney    celebrated the creation of the Common Market of the South, Mercosur, with Argentina,    Paraguay and Uruguay, and took a more active approach towards regionalism. President    Itamar Franco's greatest goal was to end chronic inflation and its perverse    culture. This was deputed to the team of his Economics Minister Fernando Henrique    Cardoso, who became the next President of Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was necessary    to form an al.ance between the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) and    the Liberal Front Party (PFL) to elect President Cardoso. He incorporated the    ideas of both parties and set out to reform the Brazilian state and economy    by inserting the country more and more within the global market economy. He    also took important steps to strengthen Brazilian regional and global influence.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When President    Luis In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva came to power, he searched for an al.ance to    conciliate elements of the PT's project of social inclusion with the need to    maintain economic stability and enhance Brazilian regional and global diplomatic    initiatives. Neoliberalism was over and security issues were dominating the    international agenda. This situation helped Lula da Silva to invest in distributive    policies and bring the State back to its leading role in the economy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>a) Mercosur    and the search for Regional Integration</i><a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When President    Geede Bush launched the Initiative for the Americas in 1990, many believed that    the Americas were about to enter a new era of prosperity led by the US, now    the only superpower. There was optimism about a possible upgrading of Latin    America within US foreign policy. Some believed that trade and investment would    drive US actions in the region and that this would promote a new wave of growth    and development throughout the region. The US hegemonic project was welcome    by a region desperately looking for a way out of recession, poverty, debt and    political crisis.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The positive impact    of the <i>Initiative for the Americas</i> in Latin America was immediate. Together    with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, in 1991 Brazil launched an integration    process called Mercosur. In Washington three months later, the US and the Mercosur    countries signed an agreement for their integration. Continental integration    was the goal. In 1993 Brazil launched the idea of a South American Free Trade    Area (SAFTA) in order to try to unify South American countries and prepare for    a larger-scale integration process.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately the    US proposal did not live up to its expectations. Soon after President Clinton    launched his Free Trade Areas of the Americas, FTAA, in 1994, it became clear    that social and political issues were not going to be addressed in the US initiative.    Due to the gap between words and reality, the FTAA proposal began to be regarded    as a mere attempt by the US to dominate Central and South American economies    and re-design its hegemony in Latin America.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Supporters of the    FTAA pointed out the positive aspects of NAFTA on the Mexican economy: the growth    of its northern region; the growth of trade with the US and so on. Nevertheless,    the Mexican case also showed that the key issue of regional imbalances in Latin    America had not been dealt with. If Mexico wanted to be looked on as a model    case to prove the success of the FTAA, there needed be at least a way to safeguard    local business interests and address regional imbalances in Latin America, an    issue that has provoked social and political unrest and instability all over    the region.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the beginning    of the FTAA initiative, Brazil has occupied a strategic position within its    negotiations. It co-chaired the process with the US while continuing to work    for the development of Mercosur, a sub-regional integration initiative intended    to go far beyond FTAA promises. As co-chair, Brazil was in a position to use    its influence to either slow down or accelerate the free trade agreement. As    it became more difficult for the US to offer what regional elites considered    to be a good deal and the US continued to insist on a parallel divide-and-rule    approach by proposing bi-national agreements to small countries, Brazil gradually    directed its influence to blocking US goals. The Brazilian elite decided to    continue to support Mercosur and other regional blocs as a regional counter-hegemonic    option.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to a    former Brazilian Ambassador to the US, Rubens Barbosa<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a>,    an FTAA acceptable to Brazil and Mercosur should include: a) the elimination    of tariff barriers and the transformation of all specific customs duties into    <i>ad valorem</i> tariffs; b) effective access to markets by means of a gradual    but continual reduction of all non-tariff barriers (i.e. quotas, phytosanitary    measures, etc.); c) discipline in the application of defensive trade measures    (e.g. safeguards against what?, antidumping measures) that affect Brazilian    agricultural exports to the United States as well as other sectors that have    been traditionally subjected to selective protectionism (i.e. steel products,    footwear, etc.); d) a precise understanding that mechanisms that provide for    unilateral trade sanctions must not be used; e) the elimination of trade-distorting    mechanisms (such as export subsidies) and the disciplined application of domestic    subsidies that affect the setting of domestic and foreign prices; and f) harmonizing    the FTAA negotiations with those of the WTO, in order to adjust the advances    achieved within the scope of the Hemisphere to the efforts that will be undertaken    in multilateral agreements. &#91;As a non-specialist reader, I do not understand    this last sentence - Graham&#93;</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As one can see,    the issues of discord between Brazil and the US concerning the FTAA were mainly    contained in the idea of trade liberalization. There was a perception that the    US proposal would trap important sectors of Brazilian economy within a set of    agreements that would benefit only US business. This view enhanced the arguments    against the FTAA backed by the US and pushed into opposition to it even those    Latin American intellectuals who supported the opening of Latin American economies    to the US.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once the path towards    globalization throughout hemispheric integration was blocked, Mercosur beguan    to demonstrate the its potential for boosting regional trade and the economy    as a whole. This has strengthened regionalism and given Brazil's economic and    bureaucratic elites a favourable situation from which to play an active role    in foreign policy and to lead regional integration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The evolution of    trade among countries in Mercosur has had an unstable but upward trend since    that edanisation was founded. Another point worth highlighting is that the goods    traded between members of Mercosur are mainly manufactured goods and services,    which are more sophisticated in terms of technology. Particularly in the case    of Argentina and Brazil, this diversification is helping foster investments    in various areas of technology and is thus enhancing the competitiveness of    the bloc. This represents an important form of support for fostering regional    businesses. The importance of large Brazilian and Argentine companies in the    regional market has increased and the idea of a South American powerhouse led    by S&atilde;o Paulo and Buenos Aires is no longer simply a desire.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>b) Development    of Regional Security</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last few years    of the Clinton presidency were market by a return to a fragmented perception    of Latin America based on traditional stereotypes. This gradually led to what    Howard Wiarda<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a> called "benign    neglect". In other words to US failure to regard the region as a priority and    as a consequence a lack of US policies for the region, which was left alone    to make and develop its own moves in terms of regional integration and foreign    policy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After September    11, US foreign policy replaced the idea of opening markets and fostering free    trade with the idea of closing borders and subordinating trade and all other    issues to national security. During the first year of President Bush's administration    US support for the legalization of illegal workers from Latin America was seen    as a matter of justice. After September 11, Latin America became a problem due    to the large number of illegal and uncontrolled emigrants already in the US    and those going there.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This situation    enhanced the perception of the Latin America elites that they had to find a    way on their own to foster economic growth, and deal with regional political    issues as well as to reduce social imbalances.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There was an open    window of opportunity for South America to strengthen its regional integration    and for Brazil to be heard in major international fora. In September 2000 Brazilian    President Fernando Cardoso invited other South American Presidents to participate    in what later became known as the First South American Presidential Summit.    According to Cardoso's assessment the meeting was historic and represented a    step forward towards the construction and exchange of common experiences on    democracy, peace, justice and prosperity for all the countries of South America.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cardoso pointed    out five key decisions taken at the meeting.<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a>    First, the countries of South America must strive together to keep and consolidate    democracy, human rights and freedom in the region. And this must take into account    the history of the great South American leaders who fought for independence    and freedom. Secondly, Mercosur and the Andean Community must move into shaping    an enlarged South American free trade area including also Guyana and Surinam.    Thirdly, each country is expected to draw up a plan and projects for the development    of South American energy and transport infrastructure. They would count on the    support of the Inter-American Development Bank and other regional institutions    to finance these projects. Fourthly, a committee was created to combat money    laundering as well as corruption and edanized crime in the financial sector.    Fifth, a regional fund was created to foster the common development of science    and technology. The seed of the South American project was planted and the debate    on regional integration began to stress issues other than trade.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Firstly seen as    an up-dated version of the South American free trade initiative taken by former    Brazilian President Sarney, the First South American Presidential Summit represented    a further attempt to keep the debate on the need for regional integration firmly    on the agenda of South American nations. It also introduced a new way of looking    at the issue of integration at the levels of energy (building dams, the use    of natural gas and other common natural resources such as water) and communications    (roads, railroads, waterways and ports).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Second South    American Presidential Summit held in Guayaquil, Ecuador in July 2002 advanced    the decisions taken in Brasilia and represented an assurance that the Presidential    summits were a new and very important multilateral mechanism for the region.    The countries of the Greater Caribbean and South America had the opportunity    to discuss how to link their economies and search for solutions to common problems.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Guayaquil Consensus    issued by the Summit emphasized the development of physical infrastructure for    continental integration. Transport, telecommunications and energy were the key    issues to be dealt by the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure    of South America (IIRSA), launched at the First Summit in Brasilia in 2000.    IIRSA's guiding vision is to facilitate integration within the three main coastal    zones of South America - the Caribbean, Atlantic and Pacific - and to link these    with the continent's internal regions. IIRSA's Technical Coordinating Committee    is composed of three key financial institutions: the Inter-American Development    Bank (IDB), the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), and the Financial Fund    for the Development of the River Plate Basin.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following up the    call for projects at the Brasilia Summit, 162 projects sectors were identified    for financing and implementation in the three priority. These include a bold    scheme for road transportation links between Brazil, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having perceived    the emerging importance of security in the post 9/11 world, Cardoso's diplomacy    started to adapt Brazilian foreign policy. By the time President Luis In&aacute;cio    Lula da Silva took office, many thought Mercosur was in decline. The new Brazilian    Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, declared the government's interest in revitalizing    Mercosur by creating a development fund and a Parliament. President Lula da    Silva became more active in foreign policy in order to pursue the regional and    global objectives of Brazil, thus creating new partnerships worldwide. In accordance    with the growing concerns about security, Brazil made its candidature to become    permanent member of the UN Security Council as a centerpiece of its foreign    policy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The experience    from two Presidential summits has indicated new ways to deal collectively with    challenges raised by regional development and diplomacy. It has also introduced    other key issues to an agenda dominated by trade. It has helped the region to    find a way to turn regional interests into dominant global security issues.    The election of left-wing leaders in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela,    Chile, Bolivia, Peru encouraged the idea that South America should go along    with integration and try to redefine itself in the new context. The formation    of South American Community of Nations (SACN) seemed the best tool to achieve    that.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The South American    Community of Nations was launched at the Third South American Presidential Summit    in the Peruvian city of Cuzco in 2004. Peruvian president Alejandro Toledo,    declared a new country was being born out of the convergence between Mercosur,    the Andean Community, Chile, Surinam and Guyana and that it would one day have    a common currency, parliament and passport. He said the new community would    also help member nations to confront the challenges of globalization and if    in the past, geography divided South America, today it unites it.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to the    Cuzco Declaration the South American countries shall improve the coordination    of regional diplomacy and policies towards the outside world. It also called    on the regional business community to come forward and participate in the process    of integration. The convergence between Mercosur and the Andean Community, as    well as the issues of energy and transport, were present too. The locations    for the summit were chosen for their historical significance and their association    with events that reflect well on South America. Cuzco was the ancient capital    of the advanced civilization of the Incas. Ayachucho was the site of a decisive    1824 victory against Spanish troops by the South American independence movement    headed by Bol&iacute;var.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The creation of    the SACN represented a radical shift for the region. Trade was no longer the    only main issue. South American countries were free to enhance their power and    practice diplomacy among themselves and with the outside world as they had never    been before. Despite strong differences in style among South American left wing    leaders, they all seemed to agree on the need to construct a regional pole of    economic and political power in order to influence world politics.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In August 2003,    23 projects for the integration of South American infrastructure worth US$ 5.5    billion were presented by 12 South American countries. Most of these projects    are near the frontiers between Mercosur countries and they aim to transform    what used to be areas beset by security concerns into areas of economic prosperity.    Growing investment from large regional enterprises, as well as multinationals,    is set to consolidate a new pole of economic growth at the heart of South America.    In 2004 alone, foreign investment by Brazilian businesses stood at US$ 9.5 billion    and most of it went to the Mercosur area.<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a>    There has been continuous growth in small- and medium-sized regional enterprises    as well as in investment from Europe, North America and Asia.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A proposal for    the setting up of structural funds to combat imbalances among Mercosur members    was approved in 2004. According to the site ADNmundo, in January 2007 Paraguay    received its first share of these funds. US$60 million dollars are in the account    of the Ministry of the Economy of Paraguay to be spent on social projects and    on the construction of roads.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">South American    is now engaged in building a strong regional system that incorporates the excluded    sectors of their societies. Mercosur has given the region an international status    it never had before. It has resisted the FTAA and offered another view of regional    integration. It led the US to abandon its one-sided project of free trade for    the hemisphere and recognize that in order to advance the process it should    look at Mercosur and other regional blocs as players to negotiate with.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>c) President    Luis In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's Government's Foreign Policy</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the time President    Luis In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva took office, a wave of conflicts on industry    and trade between Brazil and Argentina had put an end to initial optimism concerning    Mercosur. In a situation in which it could now perform a leading role in regional    politics, Brazil decided to revitalize Mercosur, creating a development fund    and a Parliament that held its first meeting in 2007.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Benefiting from    a favorable internal and external situation, Lula da Silva became more active    in foreign policy in order to pursue the regional and global objectives of Brazil    and create new partnerships. In economic diplomacy, the President played a central    role in launching SACN, later renamed the South American Union.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lula da Silva's    foreign policy moved beyond regionalism and proposed bi-national trade agreements    with other emerging and developing regions in the world. Brazil has been engaged    with countries from Central America to Middle East, Africa and Asia in order    to diversify even more its trade balance and to reduce its trade dependence    on the US and Europe. New initiatives with emerging countries such as South    Africa, India, China, Russia, have been taken in order to enlarge the international    power of Brazil and shift today's outdated international power structures.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another key Brazilian    initiative has led to the creation of the G-20, a new global summit that brings    together both developed and emerging countries into a forum for discussions    on the current economic crisis as well as the shape of the new global order    concerning finance and economics.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On matters of security,    and at first surprisingly to many, Brazil's candidature for a permanent seat    at the UN Security Council symbolizes its will to actively participate in world    decisions. Brazil is not only claiming its right to be a permanent member, but    acting and trying to influence key international issues beyond its traditional    zone of influence.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil's active    role in key international economic and security issues is not just a characteristic    of President Cardoso and President Lula da Silva or a projection of Itamaraty's    ego. It reflects the new situation and interests that are well-founded in modern    Brazil. The emergence of new elites has led Brazil to stop being a rule-taker.    The counter-hegemonic view that is being consolidated in Brazil lies in this    perspective and the confidence in its soft power.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil has developed    a successful model of cooperation with Argentina and this can be useful in dealing    with bi-national problems as well as in fostering cooperation and integration.    The <i>Bolsa familia</i> and other social initiatives are models for dealing    with poverty, hunger, education and health, and most of them are internationally    regarded as effective. Brazil has developed technology to support its social    policies and is engaged in reconstructing Haiti, perhaps the most important    experience in state-building today. On the eve of presidential elections in    Brazil, there is a general hope that what both Cardoso and Lula da Silva have    made will be enhanced and polished by the next administration.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

Secondly, to make the ideals of social justice, human rights,    wealth distribution, democracy and cooperation as important as economic growth    within State action. Thirdly, to support internationally Brazil's counter-hegemonic    policies and views as a way of dealing with today's international issues, particularly    in emerging countries. Finally, to stress its relationship with neighboring    countries and the fact of its global engagement being one of cooperation and    partnership and provide leadership by reason of the legitimacy of its actions    and ideals.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALMEIDA, Marco    et al.

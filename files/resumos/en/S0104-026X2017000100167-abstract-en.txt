Summary: This paper presents a study that explored the experiences of motherhood in women who are involved in street prostitution. For this work, motherhood is focused as a socially constructed institution linked to prescriptive social imaginary and gender control policies; and, in turn, prostitution was understood as a patriarchal social institution where the associated stigma brands the experience of those women who exercise it. Based on the analysis of in-depth interviews conducted in Barcelona the results show that the &#8216;maternal ideal&#8217; lives with the stigma of prostitution, although not negatively internalized as they have develop strategies to manage motherhood within a &#699;hidden life&#700;; however, it is also envisaged that this management involves living often contradictory experiences in the exercise of prostitution.

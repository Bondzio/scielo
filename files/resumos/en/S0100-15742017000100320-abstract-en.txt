ABSTRACT This text presents a profile of women living in the state of SÃ£o Paulo who are mothers of children ages zero to three years, and compares those whose children are enrolled in early childhood education - EI - institutions and those who do not use this service, in order to discuss the social role of these units. We used the 2010 Demographic Census as our source of data, and selected the variables referring to general profile (age, color/race, education), family life ( family structure, position in the family), professional life and income (occupation, income per capita). The study reaffirms phenomena referring to social inequalities which aggravate according with gender and race/color relations, underscoring these differences in terms of access to EI institutions.

Abstract This paper returns to the socio-religious movement of the so-called Mucker (RS, Brazil, 1874) stimulated by a recent and rather accidental encounter with a pagan priestess, in England, who referred to herself as a witch. This encounter is used here as a support to resume the accusatory discourse against Jacobina Maurer, the Mucker&#8217;s leader, and discuss it against the identity perceived by a 20th Century witch between her and Jacobina. Through the symbols which allowedfor the Identification, the paper explores the non ostensive references in the witch&#8217;s discourse.

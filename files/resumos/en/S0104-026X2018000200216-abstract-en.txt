Abstract: &#8220;Someone touches you ma&#8217;am? He said that.&#8221; This is a question that moves the short store Agda (1) by Hilda Hilst. The is made by a doctor who meets a mature lady named Agda psychosocially displaced from her interpersonal network. This short story is part of the Kadosh, in which there is another short story with the same title, Agda (2). Hilda Hilst will represent one of her recurrent thematic movements: the issue of female body in an aging process and preparing to death. The two Agdas complement each other in clashes with discursive formations and social places of exclusion that try to submit them to subjectivations that do not match their deterritorialised desires of active and critical subjective agency before their socius. In this socioaesthetic context, we will analyze the two short stories in the perspective of Michel FOUCAULT&#8217;s thoughts (2011; 2006a; 2006b; 2001) on of cares of oneself and the traditions of preparation for death. Also we will emphasize the heterogeneous and multiple production of the Body without Organs (BwO) and its psychosocial corollary conceived by Gilles DELEUZE and FÃ©lix GUATTARI (1995, 1996), among other references about subjective transversalities, eroticism, old age and finitude.

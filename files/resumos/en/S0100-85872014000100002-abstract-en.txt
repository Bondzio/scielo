This article analyses the social, economic, cultural and religious changes that have made Brazil a key node in the production of religion and spirituality in an emergent global cartography. This cartography is polycentric and cut across by multidirectional transnational networks which facilitate the flows of people, ideas, images, capital and commodities. In this article, we investigate flows of Brazilian migrants who take religious beliefs, practices, and identities to host countries; missionaries and other religions entrepreneurs; foreign spiritual tourists who go to Brazil seeking healing and spiritual development; and culture industries, mass media, and the Internet that spread globally an imaginary of Brazil as an exotic land, where the sacred is an intrinsic part of its culture and nature.

ABSTRACT In 1921, Mário de Andrade publishes, in São Paulo&#8217;s Jornal do Comércio, &#8220;Mestres do passado&#8221;, a series of articles analyzing the leading Brazilian Parnassians, a deep, long, detailed analysis that establishes a zealous reader capable of describing a poem&#8217;s characteristics, weaving comparisons between authors, ready to point out mismatches. The marginalia of this reader in Francisca Júlia, Raimundo Corrêa, Alberto de Oliveira, Olavo Bilac and Vicente de Carvalho is, in certain aspects, a prototext of this group of articles, an important contribution of the critical reader.

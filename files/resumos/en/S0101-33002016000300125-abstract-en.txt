ABSTRACT The article approaches the experience of VÃ­deo nas Aldeias (Video in the Villages) to explore the hypothesis of a &#8220;shamanic critique of the political economy of images&#8221; (inspired by a formulation of the anthropologist Bruce Albert). Taking two transversal categories - the off-screen space and the space behind the camera - the analyses of the films are moved by the question: how cinema could assume aspects of shamanic modes of knowledge and translation?

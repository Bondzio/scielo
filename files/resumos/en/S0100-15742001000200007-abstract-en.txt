This paper analyzes the demand for undergraduate courses in Federal University of Minas Gerais during the decade of 90, considering the following aspects: candidates' social and economic profile; factors which influenced the student's demand; the existing differences among courses that offer or not teaching licenses. The demand grew exponentially from 1995 on, having this growth been due to public school and lower income classes students' demand. The most pronounced increase in the demand occurred in the courses with lower social prestige of the biological area and in all those that offer teaching licenses. It also showed the presence of a clear social selectivity associated with the career choice: some of the courses, of high social prestige, to which the application test requires higher grades are preferred by the candidates from the high medium classes while the ones who belong to lower social and economic stratum generally choose others for which the approval can be achieved with medium results. The offer of evening courses shows as an aspect of democratic access to the university course.

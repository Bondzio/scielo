Abstract This paper focus on the ways in which money, sex and emotions take part in the constitution of a certain abolitionist and feminist political practice. This practice intends both to combat trafficking and prostitution and to discredit sex workers organizations. Thus, I am interested in the ways in which the very presence of sex workers in the public arena, as a movement that claims for labor rights, has become, for a sector of the argentinian abolitionist movement, in an obstacle to its promise of happiness.

Based on Foucault's last works, I intend to analyse the importance of his work about a history of thought in which the concept of event is important. Articulated with the concepts of actuality and of problematization it constitutes the means by which Foucault focuses what he calls an ontology of the present. Based on Kant he characterizes the philosophic ethos of the critique of the present, following this tradition in a specific way. By defining the questioning of actuality as a revival of the question of the Aufkl&#228;rung, Foucault makes of it an event which, if conceived as a possibility of the constitution of ourselves, questions us as autonomous subjects. The question about the limits of the present and about the possibility of violationg them restores a problematic field of thought through concentrating on the problematic issue of autonomy and liberty. Starting from this field he formulates his question about the Greeks in Classic Greece, of ethics as a kind of relation which determines how the individual constitutes itself as a moral subject of his own actions.

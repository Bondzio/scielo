Abstract This article addresses children&#8217;s process of growing and the social production of autonomy among the Guna (&#8220;Kuna&#8221;), people who traditionally inhabit the archipelago of San Blás, in the eastern portion of the Atlantic coast of Panama. My goal is to emphasize dreaming as a personal experience that serves as a context or &#8220;frame&#8221; for pedagogical practice. Considering the processes of learning during childhood, as well as the Amerindian classical discussion of rhetoric and power, I argue that Guna social philosophy establishes a sophisticated correlation between the dominant cultural discourse and the possibility of escaping it. It expresses the ideal of shared life (bulagwa iddoged, &#8220;feeling together&#8221;) while emphasizing personal autonomy as the means to realize it. This ambivalence was well expressed by Atencio López, Guna intellectual and activist who told me: &#8220;The world spins in the same and different way for everybody.&#8221;

Both grandmothers lived in socialist states and made the experience    of profound change with political and economic restructuring. But while socialist    eastern Germany and Croatia had many similar traits they also differed in important    aspects. While our interlocutors attributed their practice generally to post-socialist    developments, they based their judgements on different aspects of state responsibility.

Descrevemos    a extens&atilde;o e variedade (da pr&aacute;tica) do cuidado das av&oacute;s    nos dois campos de pesquisa e contrastamos as interpreta&ccedil;&otilde;es de    seus cuidados intensivos para com os netos.

Ao atribuir suas pr&aacute;ticas no geral ao desenvolvimento    p&oacute;s-socialista nossas interlocutoras baseavam seus julgamentos em diferentes    aspectos da responsabilidade do Estado. Enquanto desenvolvimentos demogr&aacute;ficos    podem criar oportunidades similares para o cuidado infantil, contextos nacionais    e locais variam e atores locais atribuem significados diferentes as suas a&ccedil;&otilde;es.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palavras-chave:</b>    cuidado infantil, cuidados das av&oacute;s, experi&ecirc;ncia de vida, p&oacute;s-socialismo.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In popular imaginaries,    the "traditional" grandmother is often depicted as a loving nurturer who provides    for her grandchildren with homemade food and time to listen or play. Historically    speaking, this notion of grandmother as nurturer is a relatively new phenomenon    in Europe. A combination of demographic changes and state policies have contributed    to the prevalence of this image. Because of general trends of increasing longevity    and decreasing fertility, today more grandchildren can expect to have living    grandparents for a longer period of time, and these grandparents have fewer    grandchildren (Hoff; Tesch-R&ouml;mer 2007; H&ouml;pflinger, 1999; Lauterbach,    1995, p. 71; Uhlenberg; Kirby, 1998). According to some estimates, one out of    every five Europeans is a grandparent and devotes a greater number of years    to grandparental care than they did to parental care (Attias-Donfut; Segalen,    2007, p. 7). But for grandparents to devote so much time to the care of others,    grandparenthood also has required state policies that free the elderly from    the exigencies of income generation. Pension schemes were established that guaranteed    the elderly a satisfactory income, thereby creating cohorts of elderly people    with time to care for their grandchildren (Hagestad, 2007; Leira; Tob&iacute;o;    Trifiletti, 2005; Segalen, 2003, p. 352).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But having grandchildren    and having time do not automatically lead to an intimate caring relationship    between grandmothers and their grandchildren. Apart from the potential for intergenerational    conflict, the development of a close relationship necessitates a social construction,    the "invention of grandparenthood" as Keck and Saraceno (2008, p. 133) phrase    it. Grandparenthood as a life stage and a meaningful role within the family    has only developed since the second half of the eighteenth century as part of    the European bourgeois ideal of the family (Chvojka, 2003; Keck; Saraceno, 2008).    According to this gendered ideal, care of children is the responsibility of    mothers and grandmothers more so than of fathers and grandfathers. While, in    recent years, grandparenthood has begun to attract heightened scientific interest,<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a>    there is still little in the way of qualitative comparative work concerned with    the perspectives of grandmothers themselves.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>    In this article we explore grandmaternal care and its interpretations in two    European capitals.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Herein, we present    data gathered over nine months of field research<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a>    on the meanings and values associated with kinship and the impact of kinship    networks on the provision of social security in the settlement of Travno, New    Zagreb in Croatia, and Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Berlin in eastern Germany. Data    was gathered through a number of methods including participant observation,    biographical interviews, and semi-structured interviews with members of various    age groups. In addition, we conducted twenty-five standardized interviews about    kin networks and support systems that were conducted with a random sample drawn    from lists of residential units in two large housing blocks. While data was    collected on kinship support more generally, herein, we primarily concentrate    on material related to grandparents' and especially grandmothers' perspectives.    We do not aim at a representative study of practices but rather focus on comparing    two selected life courses in order to gain a deeper understanding of meanings    attached to apparently similar practices in two different contexts and how these    interpretations are constituted through individual life courses.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, we describe    the scope and variety of grandmaternal care in our two field sites. In order    to approach the difference between a preference for all-day grandmotherly care    and a preference for public care with supplementary grandmotherly care we second,    contrast two cases of intensive grandmotherly care that the protagonists respectively    interpreted in terms of "self-sacrifice" and "natural donation". In accounting    for the differences between these two interpretations of a similar practice,    we seek to avoid simplistic dichotomies of socialist versus post-socialist or    traditional versus modern. Instead we locate these practices and interpretations    against the backdrop of the respective actors' past experiences. Taking into    account demographic and policy changes as well as post-socialist conditions,    we argue that subtle differences in the interpretation of similar practices    and attached norms are deeply embedded in life course experiences and transitions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Grandmaternal    care: a comparison</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both of our field    sites, Travno and Marzahn-Hellersdorf, are typical "socialist" settlements,    built in the 1970s on the outskirts of the respective capitals of Zagreb and    Berlin. Today, Travno has a population of approximately 12 thousand inhabitants,    while nearly 250 thousand inhabitants live in the amalgamated districts of Marzahn    and Hellersdorf. Under socialism, both settlements primarily attracted young    professionals and their families.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>    Although it is imaginable that this development could have contributed to a    loosening of family ties and isolation of nuclear families, the participant    observation and interviews we conducted reveal a great variety of intensive    intergenerational relations and the prominence of grandmaternal nurturing practices,    in particular. Grandmothers provide food for grandchildren, eat with them, provide    them with transitional or permanent housing, care for them when they are sick,    and simply spend time with their grandchildren.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Often support is    described in terms of direct help for children, but grandchildren also indirectly    profit. Food provision is an apt example of this kind of intergenerational support.    In Travno, this support often takes the form of a daily routine. Grandmothers    go shopping at the nearby market place and then cook for their children (including    in-laws) and grandchildren, who they invite over for lunch or provide with boxed    up meals to be heated up later at home. In Marzahn-Hellersdorf, in contrast,    instead of providing food on a daily basis, we more often found grandmaternal    care expressed in regular invitations to elaborate meals catering to the individual    tastes of family members (see also Streif, 2006, p. 39).<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>    In both settlements, respondents explained that this form of care saved time    and money, while also entailing symbolic notions such as convictions about what    makes for good and healthy homemade nutrition. Often in interviews, respondents    did not even explicitly mention these forms of material support as care; rather,    they described in social and emotional terms how these practices bring family    together and reinforce intergenerational ties.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In both field sites,    we also found cases in which grandparents were providing temporary housing for    grandchildren whose parents were in the process of divorcing or had divorced.    In two cases in Marzahn-Hellersdorf, for example, grandparents provided housing    or temporary housing for grandchildren after the children's parents' divorce.    In one case, grandparents cared for and housed a grandchild who suffered from    serious drug problems (Streif, 2006, p. 40). Similarly, one grandmother in Travno    took in a granddaughter when her parents divorced.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most widespread    form of grandmaternal care is caring for young, pre-school age grandchildren.    In both settlements, grandparents who live near their children accompany their    grandchildren to and from nearby nurseries, kindergartens, and schools and look    after them on weekends and when they are ill. In some cases, grandmothers even    gave up their jobs to support their daughter's or daughter-in-law's career.    In other cases, grandmothers had never entered the job market but worked at    home all (or most) of their lives. In our interviews conducted in Marzahn-Hellersdorf,    more than one fifth of the elderly respondents indicated that they were currently    involved in childcare. A much higher percentage stated that, at a previous point    when both they and the grandchildren were younger, they took an active role    in caring for their grandchildren (Streif, 2006).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite such commonalities,    we also found a major distinction between the two field sites. Children under    three are more often exclusively cared for by their grandmothers in Travno than    they are in Marzahn-Hellersdorf.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a>    One might explain this in the following way: in Marzahn-Hellersdorf, public    childcare facilities are common and many grandmothers are still employed. However,    as it turns out, Travno has a nursery for children between six months and three    years of age. Waiting lists are short, and young working couples in Travno can    leave their children at public facilities. If availability of institutional    care does not account for the difference, how else can we explain it?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this respect,    it is interesting that in both cases grandparents blamed the state for the fact    that they (the grandparents) had to care for their grandchildren. While generally    agreeing that failures by the state forced care of children onto grandparents,    east Germans blamed the state for not creating enough childcare facilities,    whereas Croatians blamed the state for not providing enough income for men,    which, they believed, would enable young mothers to stay at home and care for    their children.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We argue that the    preference for grandmaternal care over public daycare in Travno in comparison    to Marzahn-Hellersdorf results from the different experiences Croatians and    East Germans have had with state policies and differing normative evaluations    regarding female responsibilities in reproduction and the labour market. In    order to approach these differing experiences, we present two cases of extended    grandmotherly engagement with grandchildren. While these cases are not necessarily    statistically representative, they can nevertheless be fruitfully deployed as    heuristic tools of comparison, as they help us to understand why seemingly similar    practices in Croatia and East Germany are perceived differently by Croatians    and East Germans, respectively.<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Mrs. Becker:    caring for grandchildren as self-sacrifice<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a></i></b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Born in 1939, Mrs.    Becker is a widow and lives in Berlin. She has three children (born in 1959,    1963, and 1966) and seven grandchildren. Under socialism, she was a lecturer    at the economics university, but she lost her job when the university was closed    down in 1989. Instead of searching for new employment, she accepted early retirement    at the age of fifty-five so that she could take care of her grandchildren.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1989, Mrs. Becker    had five grandchildren by her two elder children. Her first granddaughter was    born in 1977 to her son, followed by two siblings in 1983 and 1987. In 1984    and 1988 respectively, her elder daughter Susanne had two sons. Mrs. Becker's    son and daughter were both in their early twenties when they had children. Compared    to her two older children, Mrs. Becker's youngest daughter Hilde became a mother    relatively late in life at the age of thirty. Hilde had her two children after    German unification: one in 1996 and the other in 1999.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mrs. Becker's son's    children were taken care of predominantly by their maternal grandmother because    Mrs. Becker's son and his parents-in-law did not want "to burden Sabine &#91;the    mother&#93; so she could unhurriedly study". In contrast, Mrs. Becker played    a major role caring for her two grandsons by her daughter Susanne. Susanne had    a university degree, but after German unification, aspiring for a more secure    economic future, Susanne pursued a second professional education as a bank clerk.    At the time, her sons were one- and five-years-old, and her decision to pursue    further education made child care indispensable. In this situation, Susanne    turned to her mother for help. Mrs. Becker recounts: "She said, 'Mum I want    to do it this way.' And I looked after her children. It was to my disadvantage."</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mrs. Becker's last    sentence indicates that the move from professional life to retirement and towards    full-time grandmotherhood was not an easy decision. Subsequently, she describes    her ambivalent experience of the transition: "From the mental process to washing    nappies and so forth. It was horrible. But the children &#91;grandchildren&#93;    are grateful. You only do it for the sake of your daughter. It's not your own    initiative." In the insecure context of economic and political restructuring    that made socialist qualifications questionable, Mrs. Becker's decision to support    her daughter in pursuing a more secure future made more sense than investing    in her own professional life. The joy of being with the children, who were grateful,    did not fully compensate for the loss of more inspiring mental work. Although    she describes her experience of caring for her grandchildren as rather demanding,    in retrospect, Mrs. Becker thinks that her daughter made the right decision    because she now has a good income. As Mrs. Becker says: "It's recognized. She's    earning a Western income."<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mrs. Becker presents    her grandmaternal care with ambivalence and in terms of a sacrifice for her    daughter. In contrast, our second example, Mrs. Duki, who also took over extended    childcare responsibilities after the demise of socialism, discusses her own    grandmotherly care rather differently.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Mrs. Duki:    caring for grandchildren as natural donation<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a></i></b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Born in 1949, Mrs.    Duki has two children and four grandchildren. She lives with her husband in    a joint household with their son and his family in Travno. Her eldest grandchild    was born in 1990 to her son, followed by two siblings in 1999 and 2001. Her    daughter gave birth to a girl in 1991.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like Mrs. Becker's    elder children, when their first child was born, Mrs. Duki's son and daughter-in-law    were both in their early twenties and still had to complete their education.    At the age of forty-one, Mrs. Duki gave up her job and became a full-time grandmother    in the joint household. Mrs. Duki also began to look over her second grandchild    - born to her daughter a year later - after her daughter decided to return to    wage-work a year later.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the time, all    the members of the family lived close to one another near &#138;ibenik. By the    mid-1990s, Mrs. Duki's son and daughter-in-law had taken up employment in and    relocated along with their daughter to Zagreb (about 350 kilometers from &#138;ibenik).    When Mrs. Duki's husband retired and she herself was out of work, they decided    to follow their son and his wife. Mrs. Duki and her husband first moved into    their own flat but again formed a joint household with their son and daughter-in-law    after the birth of the young couple's third child in 1999.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mrs. Duki explained    the decision to form a joint household in terms of its practical advantages    for both generations. Although at the time of our research, Mrs. Duki's younger    grandsons were attending kindergarten, her assistance was still desired by the    younger couple, as she says. Both her son and her daughter-in-law leave home    at 7:15 a.m. for work, while Mrs. Duki does not wake the two youngest children    until 8:00 a.m. She gets them ready, takes them to kindergarten and collects    them again at 3:30 p.m. and brings them home, while the parents work until 5:00    p.m. Her son sometimes works late, returning home after the children are already    asleep. In the afternoon, Mrs. Duki takes the children to the park or to German    lessons, sports, logopedics, or a children's workshop. She also cooks for her    grandchildren every day and prepares other meals. In fact, her daily rhythm    is completely structured by her grandchildren and attending to their needs,    positive development, and happiness. Mrs. Duki regards her situation positively:    "The grandchildren need us &#91;the grandmothers&#93; and we &#91;the grandmothers&#93;    need them."</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Interpreting    grandmaternal care</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The life courses    of Mrs. Becker and Mrs. Duki exhibit similarities in regard to past experiences,    while also exhibiting key differences. Both women lived in socialist states;    both married and have children and grandchildren. Both made the transition to    full-time grandmotherhood after the political changes of the 1990s, after which    time their attention was fully absorbed by caring for their grandchildren. In    their accounts, both grandmothers emphasize that they abandoned their respective    professional futures for the sake of their daughters/daughters-in-law (not their    sons or sons-in-law, who, it seems, would have pursued wage-work in any case).    But they do not blame their daughters(-in-law) for motherly failure; instead    they understand grandmaternal care in terms of obligation towards the younger    generation. Thereby, the grandmothers support their adult children's well-being    in insecure economic circumstances, and they do not think it would have been    better if their daughters/daughters-in-law would have given up employment for    the sake of their children.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite such similarities    and the fact that grandmotherly care is apparently taken for granted in both    cases, the two accounts differ with regards to the normative evaluations of    the respective grandmothers. In contrast to Mrs. Becker, who presents her care    as self-sacrifice, Mrs. Duki views her care as a natural donation. The shift    from professional life to full-time grandmotherhood in Mrs. Duki's account was    smoother than in Mrs. Becker's depiction. Used to mental work, Mrs. Becker experienced    the transition to childcare tasks and household chores as a loss, only inadequately    compensated for by the love of her grandchildren. Nevertheless, she is convinced    of her daughter's wisdom in securing well-paying employment and of her decision    to support her daughter in this matter. Mrs. Becker's positive evaluation of    her daughter's decision becomes evident when she talks about her second daughter,    who moved to the western part of the country with her husband, where she now    lives as a full-time mother and housewife. Mrs. Becker comments: "Now she sits    at home, does the cooking and the housework, but is utterly miserable." She    feels that her daughter's decision to be a full-time mother is making her unhappy,    whereas she believes that her first daughter, who has pursued the socialist    model of mother-worker, is happier. More than just enjoying intergenerational    ties across three generations or contributing to the happiness of her grandchildren,    Mrs. Becker sees her help as a contribution to her daughter's well-being.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In contrast, Mrs.    Duki presents her transition to full-time grandmotherhood with much less ambivalence.    It was a decision that made <i>her</i> happy. She "needs" the grandchildren    as much as they "need" her. Moreover, consecutive generations within the family    share the notion that children should not be sent to kindergarten before the    age of three. Furthermore, rather than framing her support in terms of its contributions    to the self-fulfillment of her daughter/daughter-in-law, Mrs. Duki frames it    in terms of the wellbeing of the whole family. Mrs. Duki believes that children    constitute the foundation of the family, binding generations together. And she    is willing to contribute by supporting her children (in-law) and grandchildren.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the differences    between these accounts can be explained in terms of the differing social backgrounds    of the two protagonists. Mrs. Becker is more educated than Mrs. Duki and had    a successful socialist career. Grandmaternal care became a new task for her    at the age of fifty-four when the socialist system collapsed. Mrs. Duki, on    the other hand, did not pursue a professional career and began as the chief    caretaker of her grandchildren much earlier in life, at the age of forty-one.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, both women    also share some similar experiences and transitions in their life cycles. Most    obviously, they share the experience of the demise of socialism and so too the    profound changes of economic and political reorganization. Like other women    we interviewed, both Mrs. Becker and Mrs. Duki understood intensive grandmaternal    care to be a new phenomenon brought about by post-socialist economic insecurity.    In order to confront this perceived insecurity, both believed that the best    response was to enable their daughters(-in-law) to work full time after a year    of maternity leave. Mrs. Duki did not question the aspirations of younger women    for wage-work, and Mrs. Becker clearly supported her elder daughter's wish for    an education with good economic prospects. In order to understand to what degree    grandmaternal care in fact is a new, post-socialist phenomenon and why the two-breadwinner    model is the preferred answer to perceived economic insecurity, we consider    demographic developments and employment and gender policies under socialism    and their post-socialist transformations.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Grandmaternal    care in a demographic context</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As was previously    indicated, increasing longevity and decreasing fertility rates have greatly    contributed to the phenomenon of intensified grandmother-grandchild relations.<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a>    Apart from this universal development in Europe, socialist states shared several    demographic features that equally contribute to close intergenerational ties.    Compared to western states, socialist countries typically displayed a low age    of first marriage and, for mothers, a low age of first childbirth. The average    age of women at first childbirth in East Germany in 1980 was 22.7 years, whereas    in West Germany it was 25.2 years (Bundesministerium f&uuml;r Familie, Senioren,    Frauen und Jugend, 2003, p. 76). Similarly, the mean age at first childbirth    in Croatia was 22 at the end of the 1960s, which increased to 23.9 years in    1989, while in 2001 the average was 25.5 years (Stropnik, 2003). Consequently,    the grandparental generation has also been comparatively young.<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both of our cases    fit into general patterns of (post)socialist demographic developments. Born    before the war, Mrs. Becker was twenty-five-years-old when her first child was    born. Reflecting the socialist pattern, her first two children married earlier    and had their first children at an early stage in their lives. Her two older    children were eighteen and twenty-one, respectively, when their first children    were born. Thus Mrs. Becker was forty-four-years-old when she became a grandmother.    In contrast, her youngest daughter reflects the post-unification drop in the    birth rate to almost zero. She postponed marriage and pregnancy, as did many    others from her generation who were born in the late 1960s and had only just    become adults when the transformation occurred. She was thirty when she had    her first child in 1996. In the Croatian example, Mrs. Duki gave birth to her    first child at the age of seventeen and was therefore younger than the average    woman at her first childbirth. However, her children display a typical fertility    pattern. Her son became a father at the age of twenty-three (in 1990) and her    daughter at twenty-five (in 1991), reflecting the still young but slowly increasing    age of first childbirth in Croatia in the beginning of the 1990s. Like Mrs.    Becker, Mrs. Duki became a grandmother in her early forties.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of these fertility    decisions are strongly linked to socialist family and welfare policies. In order    to explore the extent to which the socialist past may have influenced current    forms of grandmaternal support, it seems useful to follow economic developments    as well as state policies on family and female employment. Both shaped much    of the experience of the grandparental and the parental generation under consideration    here.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Grandmaternal    care: socialist pathways</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Socialist policies    supported early marriage and birth both intentionally and unintentionally. One    decisive factor was socialist housing policy, which in conditions of general    scarcity favored young couples with children. In towns in which communal housing    was distributed to young workers and their children, this led to a (further)    nuclearization of the family, as young parents and their small children moved    to into urban apartments. Grandparents often remained in the rural areas where    they had built a family house, which they shared with another child. In this    way, social housing policy often led to the geographical separation of the young    family from the (grand-)parental generation and made direct help almost impossible.    In these cases, pre-school children were placed in nurseries and kindergartens,    taken care of by neighboring women, and sometimes sent to their grandparents'    home in the countryside, seeing their parents only on weekends - which in most    cases was seen as unproblematic.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to    sharing the experience of housing shortages, socialist states share some features    of what Gal and Kligman (2000b, p. 5) call 'socialist gender orders'.The German    Democratic Republic and Yugoslavia, including Croatia, shared a commitment to    female emancipation in terms of legal equality for women and full-time female    participation in wage-work. Due to this commitment to female labor participation    and first childbirth at a comparatively young age, placing children in the care    of grandparents was a common feature of kinship support in many socialist countries.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the emphasis    on female labour market participation, the significance of the role of women    in reproduction and as caretakers within the family has frequently been highlighted    in socialist states (Einhorn, 1993; Gal, 1994; Gal; Kligman 2000a, 2000b; Haney,    1999; Haukanes, 2001; Huseby-Darvas, 1996; Lapidus, 1978; Pine, 2002; Read,    2005, 2007). This caretaking role was reinforced when birth rates in Europe    began to decline in the 1960s and 1970s and socialist governments reacted with    pro-natal policies. Similar intentions, however, resulted in policies of quite    a different nature, with the GDR and Croatia adopting pro-natal policies that    could be viewed as being at opposite poles of a continuous policy spectrum.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to encourage    women to enter the workforce and to have children, the decisive element adopted    in the GDR was the massive development of an all-embracing system of childcare.    However, public childcare was inadequate until its peak in the 1970s. This development    is mirrored in the Mrs. Becker's life course. Her son Stefan was born in 1959    and her two daughters, Susanne and Hilde, in 1963 and 1966, respectively. Mrs.    Becker was unable to obtain a place in the nursery school for her third child,    and, due to lack of time, she had to abandon her doctoral studies. At the time,    she was chiefly responsible for childcare, as her husband traveled a great deal,    her own mother had died, and her relationship with her mother-in-law was tense.    When Mrs. Becker's first granddaughter was born in 1977, her son was only eighteen    years old and in the army, and his wife was finishing her studies. For the first    three years, the little girl was taken care of most of the time by her maternal    grandmother and only saw her parents on weekends. Her parents took her back    after three years, a process described as unproblematic by Mrs. Becker.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later generations    were to have less difficulty in finding public childcare, as is reflected in    the extremely high nursery school attendance rate in the GDR.<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a>    Public and private childcare, at least in the cities, permitted most children    to be looked after between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. so that the majority of parents    who worked the so-called normal shift from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. could manage without    extra help. In extreme cases, children were accommodated in weekly nurseries    where they stayed all week including nights. It was only in the late 1970s that    policy changed in favor of more "conservative" measures thought to facilitate    combining worker's and mother's duties. In this instance, the GDR followed the    example of other socialist countries such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia and    introduced the so-called "baby year" allowing mothers to stay at home for a    year after the birth of a child. This did not affect the principle that men    and women should work and be given the opportunity to do so.<a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14"><sup>14</sup></a>    Consequently, nearly all women worked and, more importantly, all mothers. This    development stood in stark contrast to family policies in West Germany where    public childcare was generally scarce and full-time motherhood was preferred.    After unification, the West German laws were imported to the new federal states    in the eastern part of the country. Given the still existing economic inequality    between the two parts of Germany and the parallel public devaluation of eastern    biographies, former gender policies and especially the former state care system    remain amongst the few positive points of reference (Thelen, 2006a, 2006b).    Thus to a great extent, current child care practices are still experienced in    this context of divergent gender roles in East and West Germany.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The life courses    of Mrs. Becker and her children as well as Mrs. Becker's interpretation thereof    display the contrast between eastern and western Germany with regards to motherly    employment and public childcare. Like many young East German parents, Mrs. Becker's    younger daughter - a trained physiotherapist - moved to western areas after    unification when her husband received a lucrative job offer. As already indicated,    based on her socialist experiences, Mrs. Becker commiserated with her daughter:    "My poor Heike!" Referring to the differences in Germany she stated: "Alas,    whoever lived here &#91;i.e., in eastern Germany&#93; does not know that &#91;i.e.,    being a housewife&#93;." In our conversations, Mrs. Becker repeatedly construed    her daughter's situation not as coming about as a result of her own decisions    but rather due to poor employment opportunities for mothers and the scarcity    of public childcare in western Germany. She specified once more what was lacking    in her daughter's life: "And she had such a nice profession. It is a tragic.    She is as miserable as sin. Only because of child care." She blames the state    for not creating enough childcare and thus being responsible for her daughter    being a full-time mother without the satisfaction of simultaneously pursuing    a professional life.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like in the former    GDR, in Croatia socialist ideology promoted the inclusion of women in wage-work,    and by the late 1980s, women constituted 45 percent of the workforce (Kerovec,    1990). In this regard, Mrs. Duki's life course is not very representative. In    fact, her children were in their teens or older by the time she had completed    five years of employment, from which she resigned after the birth of her first    grandchild. As in other socialist countries, kindergartens and nurseries in    Croatia were a fixed element of urban city plans. However, in reality, public    child-care facilities were crowded, and many parents were obliged to look for    alternatives (Puljiz; Zrin&#154; ak, 2004). In 1989, the kindergarten enrolment    rate in Croatia was 29.4 percent, which means that even during socialism the    percentage of pre-school aged children in public institutions was very small    (Stropnik, 2003). Enrolment rates for children up to three years of age were    lower than 15 percent (Bouillet; Brai-Ru&#158;i; Zrin&#154;ak, 2002). This indicates    that pre-school children from urban areas were also taken care of by family    members. Some interpret this as one reason for the extremely low birth rate    in Croatia.<a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As in the GDR,    in the 1970s in Croatia, women were granted a one-year maternity leave period    during which they would receive the majority of their salary. Before this point    and also later, after the end of maternity leave, it was normal to bring children    of pre-school age to their grandmother's home in the countryside. At the same    time, today's grandmothers grew up with the idea that women should work despite    having children - and one way of realizing this was to rely on grandparents.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In sum, during    the socialist period, eastern Germany and Croatia shared some general features    regarding state policy towards family and female employment. Grandmaternal care    as such is not unique to the post-socialist period but already existed in the    socialist period. Equally important, however, is that in both countries this    care was linked to a positive assessment of female employment, which finds its    traces in the current acceptance by grandmothers of their daughters'/daughters-in-laws'    decision to work. Even if these grandmothers at times dislike their obligations,    they do not blame the younger generation but rather the state and the economic    situation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, public    childcare attendance rates differed in the two countries. In eastern Germany,    inclusion into public institutions, especially of children under the age of    three, was more extensive than in Croatia. By positively evaluating female employment    and public childcare in eastern Germany, one could distance oneself from West    German family policies. Mrs. Becker's constant reiterations of these differences    show their importance for her post-socialist interpretation of grandmaternal    care. She believes that her grandmaternal duties have arisen due to the failure    of state support for female employment through public childcare. Such an interpretation    is absent from Mrs. Duki account. Both grandmothers attributed their role as    caretaker to post-socialist developments but based their judgments on different    aspects of state responsibility.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Grandmaternal    care: post-socialist pathways</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are two main    ways in which post-socialist restructuring is reflected in the described accounts    of grandmaternal care. In both cases, the grandmothers blamed state failure    for the need for intensive care. However, the Croatian and eastern German discourses    differ in their divergent accounts of the retreat of the state.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mrs. Duki emphasizes    how the state has retreated from providing adequate income and employment regulation.    She stated that under socialism it was possible for a family to get by on one    salary, which would be impossible today. Therefore, she fully understands why    her daughter and daughter-in-law have to work. Like Mrs. Duki, many elderly    people in both countries feel that they benefited from the high degree of social    security provided to them by the socialist state. They highlight housing via    the workplace, (more or less) life-long job security, and, compared to the younger    generation today, relatively low demands in terms of work. They juxtapose these    socialist era benefits with the conditions facing the younger generation in    the new market economy, which in their view is linked to a high degree of uncertainty,    long working hours, and ultimately exploitation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">East German discourses    further contrast "good" socialist family and gender policies with the new western    ones. Mrs. Becker blames new West German policies that favor full-time motherhood,    and the retreat of the state from public childcare for the extensive role of    grandparents in caring for grandchildren in contemporary Germany. Both Mrs.    Duki's and Mrs. Becker's accounts can be linked to the economic restructuring    that transpired after socialism and that resulted in an insecure labour market    and greatly altered child-rearing conditions. Unemployment, particularly amongst    females and youth, has become a constant threat.<a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a>    This has made middle-aged and elderly parents concerned about the future of    their grown-up children (Raboteg-&#138;ari, 2004, p. 541). At the same time,    the position of the grandmaternal generation in the labor market became insecure,    as numerous women from this generation lost their jobs. Sometimes early retirement    policies facilitated a comparatively safe exit from the labor market, as in    the case of Mrs. Becker. The (unwanted) end of her career had the side effect    of facilitating her extensive grandmaternal care.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to our    interlocutors, another reason for stronger engagement of grandparents in childcare    is the growing demands of the labor market, which make it difficult to reconcile    wage labor and childcare. In the post-socialist era, working hours became much    more flexible and, oftentimes, longer.<a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a>    This made it difficult to reconcile working hours with the opening hours of    childcare facilities.<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a>    But public childcare has in the meantime been diversified and supplemented with    new private forms of childcare for more hours each day. While kindergarten opening    hours were often reduced in eastern Germany, the Croatian state attempted to    respond to the new demands of the market economy by introducing flexible working    hours and extending the hours of operation of state (and private) kindergartens.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Conclusion:    grandmaternal care and its embedment in life course experiences</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this article,    we have described and compared practices and notions of grandmaternal care in    two European capitals, Zagreb and Berlin. In both cases, we found a variety    of forms of support for the younger generations, with care of pre-school children    being the most prominent. In contrast to the preference for full-time grandmotherly    care we found in Travno (Croatia), our interviewees in Marzahn-Hellersdorf (eastern    Germany) showed a preference for institutional care with supplementary grandmotherly    care. We explored this contrast through two cases of intensive full-time grandmotherly    care. This led to the striking observation that intensive grandmaternal care    was interpreted as "self-sacrifice" in Marzahn-Hellersdorf (eastern Germany)    and as a "natural donation" in Travno (Croatia).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to understand    variations in practices and understandings, one must take into account the national    and local demographic paths that form the background of individual experience.    While it might be tempting to interpret these differences in terms of simple    dichotomies like more "traditional" values in Croatia versus more "modern" ones    in Germany, we have shown how grandmotherhood is embedded in individual life    courses framed by socialist experiences and transitions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In both field sites    and in the individual accounts presented herein, the experience of transition    from socialism to post-socialism figures prominently in explaining the described    forms of extended grandmaternal care. This, however, is not an entirely "true"    conviction, as during socialism grandmaternal care was a solution to certain    caring needs as well. But it shows the importance of the political changes as    a point of reference in individual lives. While both Mrs. Becker and Mrs. Duki    generally are in agreement in blaming state failure for the present demand for    extensive grandmaternal care, their accounts exhibit subtle differences. In    both countries, state policy is blamed, but while our interview partners in    Travno held the state responsible for not being able to create a better economic    situation in which families with small children could get by on one source of    income, our eastern German interlocutors held the state responsible for not    creating enough public care institutions to enable mothers to work full time.    These different interpretations of state failure are firmly rooted in experiences    of the socialist past as well as post-socialist experiences.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Socialist policies    generally supported low ages for mothers at first childbirth, which accounts    for the comparatively young and able-bodied grandparents found today in post-socialist    Europe. In addition, state policies in both GDR and Yugoslavia brought women    into the workforce. There were, however, also differences between the two settings.    In contrast with Yugoslavia, socialist East Germany's policies emphasized building    an encompassing system of public childcare as a means of including women in    the work force. After unification, the eastern German population faced the introduction    of western German policies that favored full-time motherhood, part-time work    for mothers, and reduced support for public childcare. Based on these experiences,    grandmothers in eastern Germany tend to interpret their involvement in childcare    since unification as a sacrifice they have had to make due to the failure of    the state to provide public child-care facilities and adequate employment opportunities    for mothers. Besides being an economic resource, female employment is also interpreted    as a source of self-fulfillment. In contrast, grandmaternal care in Croatia    is discursively "naturalized" as a donation for the sake of the family. Motherly    employment is here only discussed as an economic resource necessary because    of the failure of the state to provide for other possibilities. While public    childcare is universally estimated to be a good thing in eastern Germany, public    facilities for children under the age of three are heavily criticized and avoided    in the Croatian context - with grandmothers as the best solution at hand. Thus    while demographic developments might create similar opportunities for childcare,    national and local contexts vary and local actors attribute different meanings    to their action.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the younger    generation however, we see in both countries new trends emerging that replace    the old socialist emphasis on double earner families in favor of full-time motherhood.    While in Croatia the influence of the Catholic Church and conservative parties    (such as the HDZ under Tudjman) with regard to the "mother ideology" is evident    (Rubi; Leutloff-Grandits, in preparation), in eastern Germany it is the small    welfare and pedagogical institutions that further the notion of the importance    of motherly care in the first three years of life (Thelen; Baerwolf, 2008).    Due to shifts in policy and public discourse in both Croatia and eastern Germany,    we witnessed a willingness of young mothers to work fewer hours or to first    return to work when their children are one-year-old or older. Thus, intensive    grandmaternal care of infants may turn out to be a "transitional phenomenon".</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ATTIAS-DONFUT,    C.; SEGALEN, M. <i>Grands-parents</i>: la famille &agrave; travers les g&eacute;n&eacute;rations.    2<sup>eme</sup> ed.

For example, in a 1998 survey carried out on ageing    in Europe, neither grandparenting nor grandmothering were indexed (Hagestad,    2000); see also Attias-Donfut and Segalen (2007, p. 1). This has begun to change    over the last decade with the publication of research focusing on grandparental    care - see, for example, Segalen (2010) for an overview of case studies in the    KASS project; also Chvojka (2003), Hagestad (2007), H&ouml;pflinger (1999),    Keck and Saraceno (2008) and Uhlenberg and Kirby (1998).    <br>   <a name="back2"></a><a href="#top2">2</a> One exception is Herlyn and Lehmann    (1998).    <br>   <a name="back3"></a><a href="#top3">3</a> Fieldwork was conducted within the    framework of the interdisciplinary project "Kinship and Social Security" (KASS),    which was funded by the EU- 6th Framework Programme (see also: www.eth.mpg;    Heady, 2010, Leutloff-Grandits; Birt; Rubi, 2010; Thelen; Baerwolf, 2010). The    aim of the project was to compare the role of kinship in social security arrangements    in eight European countries (France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Sweden, Poland,    Croatia, and Russia). Within the project, Tatjana Thelen was the lead researcher    in eastern Germany and Carolin Leutloff-Grandits in Croatia. We would like to    thank Astrid Baerwolf and Simone Streif in Germany and Tihana Rubi in Croatia    for their fruitful collaboration on our teams.    <br>   <a name="back4"></a><a href="#top4">4</a> The buildings in both areas predominantly    consist of multi-story housing blocks with modern equipment. Flats vary in size,    with two- to three-room flats (50-80 meters-squared) in the majority. Although    the districts in both cases are often portrayed as ghettos in the media with    limited cultural programming, low quality of life, and high crime rates, the    local population of both settlements tends to find living conditions convenient.    During our research stays, residents habitually described their districts as    quiet, green areas, conveniently close to the city center and well-equipped    in terms of infrastructure.    <br>   <a name="back5"></a><a href="#top5">5</a> However, this might not be a significant    difference as cooking by grandmothers was mentioned by 70 percent of ten- to    eighteen-year-olds in a German study (Zinnecker et al., 2002).    <br>   <a name="back6"></a><a href="#top6">6</a> The lower incidence in Marzahn Hellersdorf    is in accordance with the picture provided by national statistics of Germany    more generally: an average of only 12.7 percent of all grandparents in Germany    have daily face-to-face contact with their grandchildren; 39.9 percent see their    grandchildren on a weekly basis; and 47.7 percent see their grandchildren less    than once a week. In terms of care, 7.6 percent of grandparents look after their    grandchildren on a daily basis, with another 16.2 percent doing so several times    a week (Family Survey 2000, DJI Kinderbetreuungstudie 2005, both quoted in Keck    and Saraceno (2008, p. 149, 153).    <br>   <a name="back7"></a><a href="#top7">7</a> For reasons of confidentiality, we    use pseudonyms.    <br>   <a name="back8"></a><a href="#top8">8</a> Mrs. Becker was selected as interviewee    in our random sample (see footnote 1) and was subsequently interviewed three    times on her kinship network and accompanying flows of support.    <br>   <a name="back9"></a><a href="#top9">9</a> This is a reference to ongoing payment    differentials in Germany (including differences within the now unified city    of Berlin).    <br>   <a name="back10"></a><a href="#top10">10</a> Mrs. Duki was not part of our random    sample but was recommended to us for an interview by neighbors in the settlement    because of her strong involvement in looking after her grandchildren. The interview    was conducted in 2005 and was followed by participant observation of Mrs. Duki's    everyday life.    <br>   <a name="back11"></a><a href="#top11">11</a> Nearly a third of all grandchildren    in Germany today still have grandparents when they reach the age of thirty (German    Socio-Economic Panel, quoted in Keck; Saraceno 2008, p. 143).    <br>   <a name="back12"></a><a href="#top12">12</a> People between the ages of forty    and eighty-five in eastern Germany have more than twice as many grandchildren    and great-grandchildren as their western counterparts (Kohli et al., 2000, p.    17).    <br>   <a name="back13"></a><a href="#top13">13</a> In 1989, 80.2 percent of all children    in the GDR in the respective age group were cared for in so-called cr&egrave;ches,    compared, for example, to 4.4 percent in Poland and 8.6 percent in Hungary (Einhorn,    1993, p. 262).    <br>   <a name="back14"></a><a href="#top14">14</a> These developments have mostly    been studied regarding their impact on women. For more details about the influence    of changing social policies and models of female life courses in the GDR, see,    for example, Merkel (1994), Gerhard (1994), and Tippach-Schneider (1999).    <br>   <a name="back15"></a><a href="#top15">15</a> During the socialist period, birth    rates dropped from 2.9 per woman in the decade after 1945 to 1.6 at the end    of the 1980s (cf. Grandits, 2010).    <br>   <a name="back16"></a><a href="#top16">16</a> While the general unemployment    rate was 14.8 percent in 2002 according to International Labour Organisation    standards (the official unemployment rate by the Croatian employment Service    was even 22.3 percent in the same year), this was gendered. Male unemployment    in Croatia reached only 13.2 per cent in 2002, while female unemployment rates    rose to 16.5 percent in the same year, although women had constituted 45.5 percent    of the total work force in 2001 (cf. Dr&#158;avni zavod za statistiku, 2003;    Kerovec, 2003, p. 342). Furthermore, young people in particular have been affected    by unemployment, as youth unemployment rose from 26.9 percent to 33.7 percent    between November 1996 and the first half of 1999 (World Bank, 2001).    <br>   <a name="back17"></a><a href="#top17">17</a> As previously mentioned, in the    GDR the normal shift lasted from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. In socialist Croatia, most    workers worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and thus had "free" afternoons with their    children. In contrast, post-socialist era working hours often last from 8 a.m.    to 5 p.m. or later. Taking into account that parents have to commute to work,    which in the traffic-laden cities of Zagreb and Berlin may take up to one hour    each way, little time is left for the children. In addition, in Croatia part-time    work for women is not widespread: 67 percent of fathers and 39 percent of mothers    work more than eight hours per day, while only 8 percent of fathers and 28 percent    of mothers work less than eight hours. The remainder works between seven and    eight hours a day (Raboteg-&#138;ari, 2004, p. 548). In eastern Germany, part-time    employment for women is yet another West German innovation.    <br>   <a name="back18"></a><a href="#top18">18</a> In Croatia, at least in the first    years after the end of socialism, state childcare institutions often still kept    to socialist working hours, closing at 3 p.m., and only remaining open later    when individual daycare providers agreed to stay on to accommodate parents who    could pick up their children before 3 p.m.</font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

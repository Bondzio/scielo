ABSTRACT This paper applies the methodology of economic complexity to study the connection between economic complexity and development in four Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. The paper shows that, with the exception of Mexico (and its maquiladoras), the countries remained exporting mainly primary products, with an increase in this sector&#8217;s competitiveness while high complexity sectors lost competitiveness in the last decades.

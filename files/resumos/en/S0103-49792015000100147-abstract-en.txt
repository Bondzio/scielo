The Bolsa Família (Family Allowance) Program is the subject of some disagreement in Brazil, regarding the effect on poverty, value of the allowance, conditions to receive the allowance, inclusion errors, political benefits, &#8220;exit doors&#8221;, among others. Due to this context, the intent of this article is to study Bolsa Família in a local level, from the recipients&#8217; perception. Finally, we discuss research results, which indicate a need for a higher investment in education and public health in Brazil. The study also suggests that maybe this is an appropriate moment to rethink the conditions for the allowances. Instead of controlling the recipients, governments should improve quality of health and education, as well as articulate supplementary programs, especially work programs.

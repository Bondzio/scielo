The trajectory of history as a school discipline is presented amidst the confrontations about its objectives for the education of a political and economic elite characterized by a practice of exclusion of different social groups from the education systems in the nineteenth to the twenty-first century. The teaching of history is presented by the determinations of the educational policies and the practices of the teachers in the process of creating contents and methods in the curricula of the classical Humanities to the scientific by which they established the concepts of History of Civilization, Sacred History, History of Brazil, History of Societies.

ABSTRACT This article deals with the Brazilian regional development debate and is focused on the analysis of the manufacture localization dynamics. It argues that there was no change in structural patterns of manufacture regional distribution during the period of 1999-2010. The new manufacture sites had mainly developed as spin-offs of the already consolidated manufacture areas. Such new production sites were natural resources intensive and low-technology industries.

ABSTRACT: This article proposes &#8220;social representations&#8221; (Moscovici) as symbolic formations that concentrate &#8220;symbolic capital&#8221; (Bourdieu). The first part discusses the &#8220;social field&#8221; and the &#8220;field of the object of representation&#8221;. The former focuses on the material bases, whereas the latter emphasizes group interactions. In the second part, &#8220;symbolic capital&#8221; and &#8220;social representations&#8221; are situated in a social space of struggles/conflicts in which the relationships of influence/power define the &#8220;power of becoming a group&#8221;. The third proposes that the power of the group to &#8220;enforce its worldview&#8221; goes through the recognition of the other, a process related to the &#8220;attribution of value&#8221; and affective experiences. It defends social representations as a concept that supports an interactionist and positional analysis of the social world, becoming useful and applicable to the field of recognition.

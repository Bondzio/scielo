This article analyzes contemporary Latin America from a procedural and relational perspective, from the interactions between social movements, progressive governments and the State. The goal is to understand the political cycle that begun in this century in that area vis-Ã -vis greater changes in the political, social and economic scope. More specifically, the text discusses the need to capture the social process and the diversity of types of interaction between social movements, governments and State; the specificity of the area, its dependent position in the world and social and political consequences this brings, including a transformation of the State model, which is increasingly trans-nationalized; the main axes of social conflict, originated mainly from social-political mediations and political-economic contradictions; and, finally, the types of government, the limitations of progressivism and the tensions between state management and social movements.

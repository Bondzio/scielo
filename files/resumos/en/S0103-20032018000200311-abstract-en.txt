Abstract: This work proposes to investigate the PNCF, as an access policy to the land of the PÃ© da Serra and Beira Rio rural settlements, in Nova Xavantina (MT), trying to analyze if it has been giving to the families the conditions that are necessary to develop the productive processes in the lots according to their specifications. Besides the bibliographic review, the research was made of field observations, application of questionnaires to 43 family farmers of the county, allowing, even with limitations, the development of the productive processes in the lots, the generation of employment and income to the ones settled. It has been evaluated that, due to the lack of conditions of these family farmers in buying the property with their own resources, the purchase via agrarian credit has guaranteed a bigger agility in the process of access to the land. However, the success of the program is partially jeopardized because of the mistakes of the Pronaf Investment project and because of the non-monitoring of the actions proposed on the part of the ATER (Technical Assistance and Rural Extension) institutions. These factors, combined to the high level of non-payment, cause the development of the settled families to be more difficult.

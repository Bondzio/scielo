The frequent changes of natural habitats promoted by humans increase proximity to wildlife and favor the emergence of conflicts. In recent years, residents of rural communities in the area of influence of the Dona Francisca Hydroelectric Plant (UHEDF), in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul, have complained about a supposed increase in the population of capuchin monkeys, which were causing damage to some crops. Aiming to provide subsidies for the mitigation of conflicts, this study investigated the perceptions and attitudes of those rural residents regarding the capuchin monkeys. Semi-structured interviews were applied to 31 landowners in those localities. A significant portion of respondents said that the monkeys cause injury on their properties. Although the crop losses financially commit some properties, we can see a favorable scenario for the adoption of educational and conservation practices aimed at the protection of monkeys and of their habitat.

abstract This research aims to analyze the monthly number of job dismissals by industry, from January 2004 to December 2014, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. A descriptive analysis was performed comparing the number of job dismissals and the differences between the two periods. A simple regression was used to assess the presence or absence of significant trends. In Rio Grande do Sul, a total of 12,404,198 formal jobs were eliminated over the period in question. Manufacturing had the highest number of dismissals (3,813,805) and mineral extraction the lowest (25.490). The results show that Rio Grande do Sul had a high rate of dismissals, with a significant growing trend in seven out of the eight industries analyzed.

This work is about the relations between sexualities, visual arts and power, taking in consideration the theorizations of Michel Foucault, mainly in respect to conceits like power and dissertation. Analyses like the feminine sexuality is put in dissertation through the images produced by occidental art, starting by a very particular masculine eye. In affirming that these images produce a pedagogy of the feminine, I pretend to contribute to the amplification of the analysis that take place in the teaching field of visual arts (and consequently, for the teaching formation on the area) that in the last years, through more recent methodological and theoretical tendencies, has been distinguishing the role of the images in education without, however, giving the proper attention to conceits like gender, sexuality and power.

The article aims to analyze the Brazilian Senate's project of transparency. The analytical focus is on the relationships between political statements, their logics of action and justification and the contextual factors that favored political debate on transparency and its respective plan for strategic-institutional action. The methodology combined in-depth interviews and analysis of official documents. Findings reveal the existence of two rhetorical worlds and a series of controversies arising from such polarization between justifications submitted by the then president of the institution and criticism articulated by bureaucratic sphere responsible for the management of the Senate's transparency tools.

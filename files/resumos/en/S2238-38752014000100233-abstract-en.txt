Abstract The article addresses the reconstruction of the past of seniors engaged in gerontological projects. It emphasizes that each of the narratives we call "life story" consists in producing a text that "is, in fact, not the person, but a version of the self constructed by a subject", as Ruth Behar put it. That said, the article has two objectives: the first is a theoretical-methodological one, and accentuates the interpretative and situated dimension of these narratives, exploring how some interpretive categories organize the production of life histories in geriatric agencies; the second is to contribute to a broader debate about the forms of relationships between different cultures in complex societies.

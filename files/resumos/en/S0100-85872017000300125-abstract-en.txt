Abstract This paper looks at the origins and the developments of the sociological understanding of the binominal modernity-religion. Given the theoretical fragility of classical conceptions on modernization&#8217;s processes, the social sciences have produced the paradigm of multiple modernities. Its greater consideration of context and its ability to accommodate the religious phenomenon aroused a new interest in secularization studies. Hypotheses on multiple secularizations have been unveiled. However, its support was inconsequential at both the theoretical and the empirical level. Thus, we propose a methodology that captures with greater flexibility and precision the modern dynamics of the binominal. We use medium-range analytical categories, seeking to balance extension (of case studies) and intention (of each cases&#8217; proprieties), but emphasizing the latter. Hence we propose a contextual analysis of secularization.

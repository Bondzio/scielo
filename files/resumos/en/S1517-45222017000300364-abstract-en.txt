Abstract The brain appears today, in magazines aimed at the most diverse segments of science popularization, standing out visually in newsstands. On the privileged stage of the printed media domain, this organ of the human body is presented as the protagonist of life in contemporary culture. It competes for space in display cases against photos of media stars and famous models in new clothing collections, racing with the parade of healthy bodies and with the most effective physical exercises to get in shape. In this article, we discuss how the scientific discursive production, particularly that of the Biosciences, becomes, through magazines, a device that produces a rhetoric on health regulation. In this context, the brain arises as the main organ of the human being.

The process of economic and institutional reform that was carried out in Argentina over the decade of the nineties led to deep transformations in the country's economic structure, State forms, action and configurations of its institutional apparatus. In this paper I take a look at World Bank intervention in the different stages of this process, paying particular attention to the role that this institution played in the early state of reduction of the size of the State apparatus and opening up to the market. I then go on to analyze arguments and projects regarding the strengthening of State institutional capacities and the creation of networks of social containment developed within the framework of what has been referred to as "Second reform of the State" in the mid-nineties. Lastly, I will concentrate on how these priorities related to strengthening the State were abandoned and how projects related to fiscal adjustment and public debt management acquired greater importance within the context of macro-economic imbalances and the recession that characterized the latter part of the nineties. Through analysis of the historical dynamics of World Bank intervention in the reform process, I will argue that, beyond the formal goals of numerous World Bank projects, the institution has had a mediating role between the requirements of global economic integration and the Argentine State, in both the shrinking and strengthening phases of State intervention. Projects have been oriented toward transforming these requirements into concrete institutional frameworks and state policies that increased the country's integration into the global economy. These priorities have been manifested through the crisis of the late 1990s and the beginning of the current decade.

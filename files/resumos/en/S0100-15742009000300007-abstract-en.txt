Based on microdata from the Census of 2000, this article approaches the relation between gender, skin color/race and schooling in the states of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro. It examines the course of the average years of study of white men, black men, white women, and black women throughout the generations. Its results make evident the reproduction of regional inequalities regarding schooling throughout the generations; they confirm the reproduction of educational inequalities to the prejudice of the black population throughout the generations for both genders and states; they make evident an inversion of the relation between gender and education in both states, both for male and female whites and blacks. The challenge posed by the research is to sketch the course of the movement in time that resulted in the change of the female condition of inferiority in schooling to that of superiority in relation to men, both among female and male whites and among female and male blacks in both states.

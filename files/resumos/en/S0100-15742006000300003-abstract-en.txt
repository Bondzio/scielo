This work has a double goal: a) to provide evidences that help to understand learning-identity and theory-practice relationships constructed during a teacher-education formation program; and, b) to identify if such relationships are modified by the formative experiences. At the end of the program, each participant produced a paper in a self-narrative form, that was analyzed through a theoretic-methodological perspective that is known as Network of Meanings.

Abstract A high level of income inequality has marked Brazilian society for many decades. In the period of transition to democracy, still in the 1980s, there was the expectation that the new regime would be able to solve some of the countrys major problems, one of the most important being inequality. This article aims to verify whether there was a reduction of income inequalities between classes in Brazil between 1995 and 2013, when two of the largest and most important political parties operating in the country, the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) and Workers Party (PT), headed the federal government. To this end, National Household Sample (PNAD-IBGE) data will be used for the period under study.

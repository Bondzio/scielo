AbstractIn Brazil, the socioenvironmental disasters show that the environmental education can contribute to the disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategy as it collaborates to the construction of citizenship through an understanding of hazard situation in which vulnerable population is faced to. Based on two projects of environmental education in landslide risk areas in Brazil, this paper discusses the social and environmental vulnerability as historically established process which contributes to environmental injustice in urban areas of large Brazilian cities. The studied projects, located in Niterói (RJ) and Jaboatão dos Guararapes (PE) cities, involved young people and aimed motivate them to participate in activities in order to get them to understand and change the risk situation in which they live.

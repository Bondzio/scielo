Discussions around the concept of ethics, moral and civism have been and still are present in the educational field, either through disciplines such as Education, Moral and Civics Education, Brazilian Social and Political Organization, Studies of Brazilian Problems, either through Religious Education or, more recently, through the adoption of transversal themes. Between 1997 and 2006, 13 proposals were presented by congressmen to reintroduce in schools studies of moral education and civics or to introduce a discipline that encompasses ethics and citizenship, seeking to restore values that have supposedly been lost by society. A research about these goals, their proponents and the rationales supporting them has been made. It tried to show the problems that the ambiguity in the congressmen's discourse and political practices bring to the area, also discussing the difficulties to reach a consensus over the values to be reached.

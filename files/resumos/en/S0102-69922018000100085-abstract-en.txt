Abstract The present paper has as objective to analyze the process of formation of the Fetraf in the traditional area of work of the Contag and the situation of trade union plurality generated. The Brazilian rural unionism was created in the 1960s and since its formation coexisted with a tension between the various social groups that formed the rural worker category. It were framed categories of living labor, such as employees, small landowners, squatters, landless. Since the return of democracy this system of union representation was questioned with the formation of many new actors in the field. However, it was with the creation of Fetraf in 2001, as a specific body of family farmers who went on to form a situation of trade union pluralism in the field. This has generated strong competition for legitimacy and union bases.

Abstract In Brazil, the average revenue losses of water utilities is around 36%. This value, resulting from high water losses, warns of the need for improvement in the efficiency of service providers, especially as regards the share of apparent losses which can represent more than 50% of total water losses. Focusing on this point, in this study was evaluated the influence of metrological class and the usage time of meters on under-registration, through study on pilot scale and tests in a laboratory scale. Thus, was proven significant reduction of apparent water losses due to the replacement of class B meters by the class C meters, and the economic viability of this investment. Furthermore, discoursed out about the interference of the use of water tanks and about the influence of tariff policy on the financial performance of the utilities and consumption of users.

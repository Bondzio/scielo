Attempts to promote the articulation between the Amazon rainforest and its so-called traditional populations have intensified greatly in recent decades, both in academic as in environmental activism. The notion of sustainability, understood as a strategic apparatus, operates in the intensification of such coupling, bringing to light renewed analysis of the relationships between traditional peoples and the nature in the Amazon. The purpose of this paper is to discuss and analyse such articulation, taking as a starting point several text analysis on the Brazilian Amazon published in newspapers of wide circulation. The emphasis was given on the discourse on global climate change, which often describes the Amazon rainforest as a carbon depot, and attaches to the traditional populations a role of guardians of this carbon. In this sense, the discussions brought here aim at underlining the capability which the discourses on climate change have to integrate the stock market into the preservation of nature.

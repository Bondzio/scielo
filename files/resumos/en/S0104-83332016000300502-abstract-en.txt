Abstract A set of documents &#8211; list of witnesses, photographs, records, reports etc. &#8211; is found inside the archives of transsexual people that require a change of name and/or sex in the civil registry and are attended in the Defense Center of Sexual Diversity and &#8220;Homoaffective Rights&#8221; of the State Public Defender of Rio de Janeiro. This paper aims to reflect on how these documents are capable of producing reality and giving materiality to the subjects of these processes, allowing certain rights to be accessed only by those who are considered &#8220;true transsexuals&#8221;.

Turner's thesis that frontier had forged convergence between democracy and individual economic ascension did not inspire Latin American critical studies because here the reality showed the other side of the frontier: a space where the social conflicts of the dynamic centers were purged and exacerbated. In this process, the first conflicts did not occur among the migrant population and workers hired by the absent landowner, but among everyone else against the Indians. Much has been discussed about it but very few have focused on the other side of frontiers: the indigenous agriculture. This is clearer when one considers the Cerrado Region. In the past 10 years only 5 articles, including national and international journals, analyzed the Indian Agriculture History and Practices in Cerrado. The goal of this paper is to offer a brief history of Indians agrarian systems, from their origin to decline, in Brazilian Cerrados.

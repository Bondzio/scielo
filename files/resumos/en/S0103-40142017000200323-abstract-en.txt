ABSTRACT abstract &#8211; The article recovers the history of the Brazilian record label Chantecler, founded in 1958 and based in São Paulo, which played a crucial role in the production of Brazilian regional music, especially Brazilian sertaneja music. Until the 1990s, regional music genres were mostly disregarded by major international record companies operating in Brazil. From that perspective, this work discusses the stratification of popular music consumption in Brazil after the 1960s, noting the role of domestic vis-à-vis international record labels, and thus contextualizes the presence of Chantecler in the broader scenario of the national record industry.

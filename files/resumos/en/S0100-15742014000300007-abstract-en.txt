This text belongs to the field of studies on the evaluation of public policies and aims to analyze the educational planning carried out using PAR. More specifi cally, it intends to answer questions regarding the responsiveness of educational systems to the application of PAR and the ability of this planning tool to draw together the entities of the federation for the management of education. The analyses developed here are based on questions related to the process of centralizing/decentralizing educational policies. The implementation of PAR presents diffi culties in achieving the goals of integration and collaboration between the entities of the Federation at the same time that it contributes to the development of planning and dialogue actions between educational systems.

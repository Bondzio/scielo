Our involvement with the theme of education in the social field comes from research that is based on the theoretical and methodological principles of ethnography. In this text, which is by way of a theoretical study, we tested our position on the practices of education beyond the school, anchored to four supporting pillars. They are: urgently overcoming the debate about their various forms of appointment; a more detailed look at the issue of intentionality that is present (or not) in educational practices within the social field; an expanded concept of education, designating it as a social practice that is also a political act; the possibility of introducing other theoretical bases for educational practice that, because of its attitude of openness and welcoming acceptance, constitutes a transdisciplinary body of knowledge.

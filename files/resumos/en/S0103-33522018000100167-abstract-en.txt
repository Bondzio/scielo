Abstract: The research here presented dedicates itself to the study of the party polarization in the United Stantes betweeen 1936 and 2012. Through national platform analysis and gradation indicators, this study seeks to empirically point distances and approximations between the two political parties on the foreign policy arena. The results indicate that here is a recent party polarization relatively new in the history of these two parties caused, mainly, by an important conservative ascendacy by the Republican Party.

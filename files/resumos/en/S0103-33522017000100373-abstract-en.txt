Abstract The work The Streets and Democracy - Essays about Contemporary Brazil, by Marco Aur√©lio Nogueira, consists of many essays of conjunctural analysis and which deal mainly with the street protests, occurred in the country in the year 2013. Written in the &#8220;heat of the moment&#8221; and trying to make intelligible the present then experienced by analyst, these texts assume that the political system failed to give a satisfactory answer to the new demands of Brazilian society, characterizes as hypermodern, generating, then, the protests. For more plausible as it may seem this diagnosis, the author does not present sufficient data that support, treating the phenomenon so vague and little enlightening.

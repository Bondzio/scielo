This article attempts to interpret some dimensions of a common police practice in S&#227;o Paulo during the 1970&#8217;s that consisted in keeping under permanent and minute watch the urban space, through the &#8220;rondas&#8221;, or mobile patrols constantly going around the city. It analyses the reorganization of the police apparatus under the influence of &#8220;national security&#8221; ideology which, centered on the idea of an &#8220;internal enemy&#8221;, puts under suspicion every citizen, especially the working man, who is thus discriminated against and bears the burden of proving that he is neither part of &#8220;marginalized&#8221; gangs nor a &#8220;bandit&#8221;. It also discusses how, during this period, the press tends to criticize such practices only for the &#8220;excess&#8221; of their zeal, going sometimes &#8220;too far&#8221;. Finaily, it emphasizes some paradoxical aspects in the &#8220;discourse of suspicion&#8221;, amongst which the most outrageous one: in the name of &#8220;good citizens&#8221;, citizenship itself is destroyed.

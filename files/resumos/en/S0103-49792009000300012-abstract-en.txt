The objective of this paper is to confront some ideas that can help us to save the disagreements in pluralist societies, conflictive and complex like Latin America itself. Specifically, the ideas that will be exposed and confronted in the text will begin with a brief introduction, and, afterwards, with an exposition of the pluralism in our current societies and how this impels us to look for viable exits to save our differences. Later, we will discuss the kind of consensus that we should assume and the dialogue option or communicative pact to obtain it. We will take, for the previous topic, some concepts of communicative action and a discursive ethics, to then approach the structure in which certain desirable minimal denominators would be sustained to account for dissension and (or) conflict, and the proposal of some minimal denominators. Consequently, we will talk about the State role as a warranty of the commonwealth, for, finally, to sketch some conclusions.

Recognizing some of the factors that have facilitated or    impeded discourses and action to promote sexual rights around the world, we    explore the principles and processes of framing sexual rights and sexual citizenship.    We consider political opportunity and the mobilization of resources as important    as cultural and emotional interpretations of sexual rights in conceptualizing    a "sexual rights movement". Throughout the paper we question whether    a movement based on solidarity can be forged between different social movements    (i.e., feminist movements, HIV/AIDS movements, LGBT movements, etc.) that are    advocating for distinct sexual rights. While theoretically sexual rights range    from protection from sexual violation to the celebration of sexual pleasure,    in reality the agendas of sexual rights movements are still largely fragmented,    heteronormative, and focused on negative rights.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Keywords:</B> global discourse, local activism,    sexual rights, social movements.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="VERDANA"><B>RESUMO</B></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Este artigo enfoca o desenvolvimento de discursos    que circundam os direitos sexuais juntando tend&ecirc;ncias em di&aacute;logos    globais oficiais com realidades nacionais e locais. Reconhecendo alguns fatores    que t&ecirc;m facilitado ou impedido discursos e a&ccedil;&otilde;es que promovam    direitos sexuais ao redor do mundo, n&oacute;s exploramos os princ&iacute;pios    e processos onde se enquadram os direitos sexuais e a cidadania sexual. N&oacute;s    consideramos que as oportunidades pol&iacute;ticas e a mobiliza&ccedil;&atilde;o    de recursos s&atilde;o t&atilde;o importantes para a conceitualiza&ccedil;&atilde;o    de um movimento pelos direitos sexuais quanto as interpreta&ccedil;&otilde;es    culturais e emocionais dos direitos sexuais. Ao longo deste artigo, n&oacute;s    questionamos se um movimento baseado na solidariedade pode ser forjado entre    movimentos diferentes (por exemplo, movimentos feministas, HIV/Aids, movimentos    GLBT, etc.) que est&atilde;o reivindicando direitos sexuais distintos. Enquanto    teoricamente os direitos sexuais v&atilde;o desde a prote&ccedil;&atilde;o da    viola&ccedil;&atilde;o sexual at&eacute; a celebra&ccedil;&atilde;o do prazer    sexual, na realidade, as agendas dos movimentos pelos direitos sexuais est&atilde;o    ainda muito fragmentadas, heteronormativas e enfocadas em direitos negativos.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Palavras-chave:</B> ativismo local, direitos    sexuais, discurso global, movimentos sociais.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the late twentieth century, globalization    has been characterized by accelerating exchanges of social, cultural, political    and economic capital across country borders (see, for example, Appadurai, 1996;    Castells, 1996, 1997, 1998; Giddens, 1990, 1991; Harvey, 1989; Waters, 1995).    Evolving technologies have transformed the modes of production and the means    of communication between individuals, social groups, and interacting cultures    (Appadurai, 1996; Castells, 1996). As nation-states become more integrated into    the global economy, emerging challenges have not been limited to the political-economic    realm, as cultural and social exchanges between countries have allowed for a    reflection on the norms and rules that were once second-nature and are still    seldom questioned. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As more focus is given to social and political    debates questioning the deeply rooted traditions of patriarchy (Castells, 1997),    researchers and activists have become more aware of the implications of gender    and sexual norms on the health and general welfare of populations. This article    draws attention to the dialogue between global definitions of sexual rights    and local understandings and claims to such rights. We review the current literature    on the emerging discourses of "sexual rights" in the global arena,    and explore the ways in which this global debate maps out on the local level.    Interpersonal social and cultural norms are particularly important in determining    the way in which sexual and gender roles are played out on the local level.    This is especially crucial for the dialogue between a burgeoning sector of civil    society that endeavors to, on one hand, interpret and push the envelope by drawing    from the global discussions on 'sexual rights', and more importantly brings    forth the personal experiences of those who are marginalized and denied fundamental    rights on the basis of gender, sexuality, identity, race, class, and so forth.    The impact of this discussion over 'sexual rights' matters most where the 'personal    becomes political'. This dialectic between the personal and the political is    complicated by the layers of meaning given to the term 'sexual rights' in different    contexts and cultures. And this dialectic is even more complex considering the    amplitude of the umbrella category "sexual rights", which encompasses    many aspects of sexuality that affect populations with differing identities    and agendas.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Can the <I>struggle for sexual rights</I> be    deemed a social movement? This question is complicated because the domain of    sexual rights is being defined and constructed at a point of intersection between    a number of movements (feminist, gay and lesbian, queer, trans, HIV/AIDS, etc.)    that for much of the past 20 years have evolved in quite separate ways. Part    of the challenge (and the unanswered question) is whether a notion of sexual    rights might be constructed that can be broad enough to bring these movements    together in a broader alliance or coalition, without being so broad that it    loses its political edge and fails to serve any real purpose. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the spirit of solidarity, the act of defining    notions of "sexual rights" as a transnational social movement with    deepening roots through national and local networks is a veritable challenge    in the beginning of the twenty-first century for those advocating for different    aspects of sexual rights. Solidarity has proven to be an extremely effective    way to mobilize, gain legitimacy in the political realm and to achieve meaningful    policy and socio-cultural transformations. Much of the social movement literature    has questioned why, when, and how social movements emerge&#32;&#150;&#32;some giving    more weight to structural forces such as political opportunities (McAdam; McArthy;    Zald, 1996; Tarrow, 1998) while more recently the literature has highlighted    the importance of the socio-cultural realm and the redefinition of the life-worlds    where contention is not focused solely on the state or economic centers (Alvarez;    Dagnino; Escobar, 1998; Parker et al., 2004). Later social movement theory has    given great importance to the dynamics through which contention is framed (Benford;    Snow, 2000) and to the role of embodiment and emotions in the mobilization of    collectives with common goals and experiences (Brown et al., 2004; Parker, 1996;    Polletta, 1998; Polletta; Jasper, 2001). Theorists of popular participation    and education, the most commonly known being Paulo Freire, have emphasized the    importance of the use of a language that emerges from the people, while questioning    social texts that emerge, and are sometimes imposed, from above (Freire, 1973).    Thus, considering <I>socio-cultural norms</I>, <I>political opportunity structures</I>    and <I>framings</I> of rights allows for a <U>theoretical</U> conceptualization    of a 'sexual rights movement' that is defined by global dialogues as well as    by local contexts and embodied realities. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This movement has certainly been driven and thwarted    by political opportunity structures (e.g., regime changes) as well as by the    emotional desire for freedom from and freedom for sexual autonomy. The issues    of framing emerge both in cultural contestations of what is acceptable behavior    and identification and the dynamics of opposition over what is deserved and    claimed as a sexual right depends on negotiations of time and space. We argue    that in this stage of globalization (when discourses of human rights co-exist    in an uncomfortable relationship with the proliferation of religious fundamentalisms    and neo-liberal economic policies) the limits of our personal autonomy have    been re-drawn (Castells, 1997). Movements on behalf of sexual rights have encountered    a powerful reactionary response in traditionalist movements rallying for conservative    family values and religious beliefs (Lamberts-Bendroth, 1999; Ratzinger, 2003,    2004; Marty, 1988). In the third decade of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, ideologies,    rights, and identities have mediated the issues around which resources are mobilized    and the policies that are advocated for throughout the world (Heywood, 1999).    In light of this, a connection has also been made between discourses around    these emerging sexual rights and public health (World Health Organization, 2002).    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For one, global social movements have played    a crucial role in shaping the intersections between the political economy and    the embodiment of HIV/AIDS, other health-relates problems (Brown et al., 2004),    education and other the distribution of other social goods. The urgency of the    HIV/AIDS pandemic has been an indelible force in placing previously unquestioned    sexual and gender norms under the looking glass, revealing that the transmission    of a microscopic biological entity is in fact driven by social, cultural, political    and economic forces (Berkman et al., 2005; Ford; Odallo; Chorlton, 2003; Gamson,    1989; Parker, 1996, 2000). HIV/AIDS has drawn attention to certain populations    that are categorized, medicalized and objectified in terms&#32;&#150;&#32;including    commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, and intravenous drug users   &#32;&#150;&#32;that have been used to target risk groups in behavioral interventions    (Farmer; Connors; Simmons, 1996; Mann; Tarantola; Netter, 1992; Parker 2001).    In the name of objectivity, these groups have often been blamed and shamed as    responsible for the spread of the epidemic (Maluwa; Aggleton; Parker, 2003;    Parker; Aggleton, 2003). More recently, the globalization of conservative ideologies    emanating primarily from the United States, have increased vulnerability (especially    of women and children in poor countries of the Global South) to the epidemic    by advocating for abstinence-only education and stressing the importance of    abstinence until marriage and fidelity during marriage over condom use as means    of prevention from HIV infection (Arnold et al., 1999; Girard, 2004; Jones,    2002). Interestingly enough, the structural and cultural contextualization of    biomedical explanations parallel the processes of socio-cultural globalization;    and the relationships between sexual rights and sexual health are shaped by    how we have come to interpret the historical impacts of the pandemics of HIV/AIDS,    the intentional infliction of shame, stigma and discrimination, cultural imperialism,    and the preeminence of the economic rights over human life. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The embodied realities of illness and of the    denial of access to essential public services bring home the importance of considering    gender and sexuality as factors significant as poverty, race, ethnicity and    class in the contemporary definition of rights and citizenship. Because social    norms related to sexuality are enforced and perpetuated by political, economic,    social and cultural spheres of power&#32;&#150;&#32;a change towards greater equality    between genders and respect for the citizenship of sexual minorities requires    a re-imagining of what constitutes a human right. Rights are no longer limited    to the protection of private property or of political and civil liberties, as    the term has been extended to other realms of human life. The emergence of sexual    rights has highlighted the importance of considering culture and religion, for    example, as important as government policy as areas of contention and targets    for intervention. Because rights that are not 'officially' recognized by governments    or international governing institutions (e.g. the United Nations) are sometimes    dismissed as merely rhetorical discourses, the race to include sexual rights    within formal documents generated by such institutional structures has dominated    the agenda of international activists (Corr&ecirc;a; Petchesky, 1994; Corr&ecirc;a;    Sen, 1999; Petchesky, 2000, 2003). Opponents have reacted negatively to the    classification of sexual diversity and sexual pleasure as human rights, by claiming    that legitimizing aberrant lifestyles jeopardizes the family and religious traditions    for generations to come (Girard, 2004). The media has played a major role in    sensationalizing certain issues such as trafficking in women and children, same-sex    marriage, female genital mutilation, and HIV/AIDS. In reality, although sexuality    affects every aspect of human development and social interaction, the topic    been actively repressed in spaces such as educational and health systems in    many parts of the world. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The HIV/AIDS pandemic is a major, albeit not    the only, driving force in the global fight for sexual rights. Social mobilization    for 'sexual rights' and against patriarchal and fundamentalist socio-cultural    norms can be traced back to feminist and gay rights movements of the 1960s,    although the term itself was almost never used until the mid-1990s (Parker,    1997, 2000; Petchesky, 2000). While the globalization of social and cultural    understandings of rights has played an integral role in furthering the seminal    work of social movements born in the middle of the twentieth century&#32;&#150;&#32;   a closer look at the current state of global transformation reveals that homegrown,    grassroots movements and networks may often be more important than transnational    mobilization in transforming social norms (Tarrow, 1998). Thus, it is also important    to highlight the somewhat complicated development of civil society during last    half of the twentieth century when many countries throughout the world transitioned    from authoritarian to democratic regimes:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Emergent civil societies in Latin America and      Eastern Europe are credited with effective resistance to authoritarian regimes,      democratizing society from below while pressuring authoritarians for change.      Thus civil society, understood as the realm of private voluntary association,      from neighborhood committees to interest groups to philanthropic enterprises      of all sorts, has come to be seen as an essential ingredient in both democratization      and the health of established democracies. (Foley; Edwards, 1996, p. 38).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Global transformations resulted in a vast variation    in the definition of the public and private spheres, and more specifically in    what were considered fundamental principles of citizenship&#32;&#150;&#32;principles    that would have been impossible to claim during earlier periods of authoritarian    or military regimes in many parts of the world. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brazil and South Africa provide interesting examples    of how solidarity between social movements can be forged during periods of intensive    political struggle. During the redemocratization of Brazil in the 1980s, a variety    of social movements (including the sanitary reform movement, the labor unions,    gay rights movements, the Catholic Church, among others, and many non-governmental    organizations) came together during a time of opening in civil society (<I>abertura</I>)    in the spirit of solidarity on behalf of citizenship for all. This partly explains    why the 1988 Constitution is extremely detailed and rife with references to    a variety of rights, including gender equality (Pintaguy, 2002). Nevertheless    the Brazilian Constitution does not protect against discrimination based on    sexual orientation. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other hand, in South Africa, in the struggle    against apartheid diverse aspects of civil society came together to ban discrimination,    including that which is based on sexual orientation (Cameron, 1993, 2002). Rev.    Desmond Tutu, a prominent leader in the anti-apartheid movement argues that    black people were discriminated and blamed for being black, something over which    they had no agency, and he made a strong statement that "it is the same    with sexual orientation" (Afrol News, 2006). Having fought against outrageous    levels of discrimination, Rev. Tutu explains that it would make no sense to    fight against discrimination based on race without fighting against discrimination    against homosexuals (Afrol News, 2006). South Africans have managed to include    a broad definition of human rights in their new constitution precisely because    of the solidarity that activists from diverse walks of life felt against a highly    repressive and violent regime. Even though both Brazil and South Africa had    strong alliances between various fronts of civil society, the South African    constitution managed to adopt a constitution with a broader definition of human    rights. In any case, highly contentious cycles, such as the change from authoritarianism    to democracy, provide a political opportunity structure where the definition    of human rights can be more easily restructured. Further investigation in this    area is necessary to analyze what elements and degrees of openness within civil    society create a more favorable atmosphere for solidarity between social movements.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We therefore want to emphasize the importance    of 'civil society' in the consolidation of rights and the definition of citizenship.    Civil society can be conceptualized as space where cultural norms and the interpretation    of rights are defined (Clark; Friedman; Hochstetler, 1998; Foley; Edwards, 1996).    Although the notion of rights often conjures the image of the protection of    citizens by the state in the form of a social contract, we conjecture that social    movements act in the realm of civil society where cultural norms are contested.    The goals of social movements advocating for a respect for sexual diversity    and gender equality includes changing laws and state policy. But slow and sustained    contestation on the local level can perhaps bring about longer-term commitment    to sexual rights. The contestation of cultural norms that occurs gradually,    over time, can be said to create changes in <I>habitus</I> (Bourdieu, 1998)   &#32;&#150;&#32;potentially making discrimination, stigmatization, and marginalization    of sexual diversity more socially problematic. What seems to be a step forward    in the legal codification or discursive acceptance of sexual rights may mask    injustices that happen in socio-cultural realms and in the private sphere. Legal    codification can in fact reduce the effervescence of social movements within    civil society that is necessary to bring about long lasting social transformation.    To add complexity to this matter, the nature of civil society has changed in    the twentieth century due to financing structures and the relationship between    the state and non-governmental organizations. Nevertheless, the increase in    non-state actors can also reflect the ideologies of financial institutions or    even reinforce state level policies through a process often referred to as the    co-optation of civil society (Fischer, 1997).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Thus, the obstacles faced in seeking to advocate    for sexual and reproductive rights, range from institutional and infrastructural    barriers (including the politics of financial support) to the difficulties of    addressing questions of sexuality within the structures of judicial systems,    governmental and intergovernmental agencies (Corr&ecirc;a; Parker, 2003; Petchesky,    2003). But while these structural forces provide or deny rights, it would be    a mistake to forget or ignore the importance of local understandings or individual    and communal claims to such rights. Without a doubt, sexual violence, oppression    and discrimination are among the most serious threats to human security today    at every level of societies: at the level of the family, the neighborhood or    community, the nation-state, and the international community (Corr&ecirc;a;    Parker, 2003). Thus it is important to focus not only on the 'formal institutionalization'    of sexual rights, but also to pay close attention to what some would consider    an 'informal' recognition or rejection of sexual rights in the realms of culture    and civil society. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, some discussions about sexuality, sexual    health and sexual rights have centered on the <I>embodiment</I> of citizenship    (Parker; Barbosa; Aggleton, 2000). These notions have highlighted the complexity    of human sexuality&#32;&#150;&#32;especially the tension between recognizing its fluidity,    social construction and historical continguency, on one hand, and the need to    create categories and identities to 'operationalize' sexual rights, on the other    hand. Research on sexuality and gender has discussed the complexities that characterize    intimacies of human relationships, whereas international human rights movements,    feminist movements, LGBT rights movements, and People living with HIV/AIDS movements    have sometimes found it easier to create <I>identities</I> to guide lawmaking,    the mobilization of collective action, and the allocation of resources. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On a daily basis, individuals negotiate between    different aspects of their "selves" (e.g. the working class, gay,    Afro-Caribbean Latino, living in East Harlem with two children). Identities    are not only fragmented politically among groups, but this fragmentation is    also mapped onto our bodies. While identity politics (Calhoun, 1994) delimit    certain dimensions of sexuality for the sake of <I>protection </I>that may comes    from belonging to a defined group<I>, </I>a broader human rights perspective    has begun to place sexual and reproductive rights within the gamut of fundamental    <I>human</I> freedoms (Corr&ecirc;a; Parker, 2003; Corr&ecirc;a; Petchesky,    1994; Narrain, 2001; Parker et al., 2004; Petchesky, 2000). This notion of a    universal human right is inevitably conflicted with the application of these    rights on the ground, where they may encounter cultural and political resistance.    Thus, for these rights to be 'operationalized' in a substantive way, these forms    of resistance should be addressed from below, from grassroots movements, as    well as from the top. If we are living in a time when identities are crucial    for the definition of rights, then identities must ideally be constituted, articulated    and defined through self-representation rather than being represented by others    acting as "protectors". Nevertheless, the creation of categories may    initiate a reflexive contemplation that may result in the formation of communities    that were once unimagined. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact, the conception of "sexual rights"    was first centered on reproductive rights in order to <I>protect</I> women from    violations such as forced sterilization, physical abuse, rape and sex trafficking    (Corr&ecirc;a; Petchesky, 1994; Petchesky, 2003). The definition of "sexual    rights" has been broadened by lesbian, gay, feminists, HIV/AIDS activists    in order to include the celebration of sexual diversity and sexual pleasure.    (Corr&ecirc;a; Parker, 2003; Parker, 1997, 2000; Petchesky, 2000, 2003). Coming    from a number of fronts advocates for sexual rights as well as counter-movements    have framed the concept strategically, with varying agendas including that of    sexual health. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This work has also been extended on the regional,    national and local levels through diverse initiatives focusing on sexual rights.    In order to highlight the socio-political importance of international dialogues    and local understandings of sexual rights, it is important to bring together    several ethical principles and theoretical frameworks that begin to deepen the    meaning behind the term "sexual rights". Several lines of theoretical    thinking that have grown to complicate theories of rights include (but are not    limited to) the discussion of sexual citizenship, cultural imperialism and the    global proliferation of sexual rights. Behind these theories lie fundamental    struggles for equality, freedom, and human dignity&#32;&#150;&#32;where ownership of    the body is the value premise. In the following section we describe some of    these principles and their implications on the mobilization on behalf of sexual    rights as an effort that will most effectively promote social change&#32;&#150;&#32;   assuming that these principles are defined, understood, and claimed as rights    on the local and global scale.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Framing sexual rights as human rights</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sexual rights are said to embrace human rights    that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents    and other consensus documents. These include the right of all persons, free    of coercion, discrimination and violence, to: the highest attainable standard    of health in relation to sexuality, including access to sexual health including    reproductive health care services; seek, receive and impart information in relation    to sexuality; sexuality education; respect for bodily integrity; choice of partner;    decide to be sexually active or not; consensual sexual relations; consensual    marriage; decide whether or not, and when to have children; and pursue a satisfying,    safe and pleasurable sexual life. The responsible exercise of human rights requires    that all persons respect the rights of others (World Health Organization, 2002).    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On one level, sexual citizenship can be associated    to having fundamentals right to free expression and just desert. Freedom of    expression usually refers to expression in the public domain, while sexuality    and gender relations have typically been relegated to the private sphere. In    general, the types of rights that are associated with the public sphere include    political, civil, and economic liberties, which are distributed and protected    by the state. The idea of sexual rights brings forth the ability to express    sexual diversity in the public sphere&#32;&#150;&#32;especially if political, civil    or economic rights are contingent on sexual orientation and gender, for example.    Sexual rights, in this sense can include the right to divorce, the right to    marry, the right to choose sexual partner(s), the right to be protected from    violence, the right to inherit, the right to adopt, and the rights to receive    public services such as education and healthcare, an so forth. Often sexuality    is lurking but is not acknowledged as a factor that colors our basket of fundamental    rights. Thus, the conventional language of rights (if sexual rights are not    included) is often heteronormative and sexist by nature&#32;&#150;&#32;excluding parts    of our selves that behave, identify, or have interpersonal relations outside    of socio-cultural norms. At some level, one of the strategic uses of the phrase    "sexual rights" is precisely to undercut or question this heteronormativity.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If our fundamental rights are contingent on sexuality    or gender, are they rights or are they privileges? We argue that a public distribution    of goods that does not abide by the principle of equality is inherently unjust,    and that 'rights for some' equates to rights for no one. If either through legal    mechanisms or through stigmatization and shaming a transgender woman does not    have access to health services or to employment other than sex work, then we    can see concretely how infringing on sexual rights can also deny economic rights,    political and civil rights. The rhetoric of rights loses its meaning if it is    applied arbitrarily or according to factors such as ethnicity, gender, sexuality,    class, etc. Thus, the idea of sexual rights takes into account the importance    of considering sexual diversity and gender equality as key to reaching true    citizenship.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> On another level, it is important to re-question    the division of private and public domains. Sexual violence, rape, and abuse    often happen in closed quarters, and even within the sanctity of the heterosexual    marriage. Who should prevent these types of rights violations? Should the state    be allowed in the bedroom? Should the state become a form of barrier protection    during sexual intercourse? Here is where the limitations of legal protection    are most salient. What happens to rights when the state cannot clearly administrate    their distribution? In many contexts, women are considered to be the property    of men&#32;&#150;&#32;essentially categorizing women as objects bereft of human dignity.    These matters are further normalized as cultural or social norms in some contexts.    This discussion goes without further explanation because it seems clear, <I>prima    facie</I>, that distributing rights differentially according to gender denies    citizenship to women. Even so, some argue that a cultural right (the right to    express one's culture) supercedes the right to gender equality (Saiz, 2005)    This argument not only assumes that <I>any</I> established social order is inherently    just, but it also highlights the necessity of classifying sexual rights as fundamental    and inalienable. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The same reasoning can be applied to inequality    based on sexual orientation or on being transgender, for example. Although diverse    sexualities and forms of expression are considered abominations and dangerous    to the social thread in almost all societies (primarily through the influence    of fundamentalist and conservative fronts), rights should not be denied to a    person because of their sexual identity, unless a harm to others can be coherently    argued. Let us steer clear of those that attempt to equate sexual diversity    with pedophilia and bestiality in order to avoid muddling the waters. Whereas    pedophilia and bestiality may be seen to violate human or animal rights, being    homosexual and/or transgender are individual lifestyles with no harm to other    individuals. We argue that exposing society to diversity is not a moral crime   &#32;&#150;&#32;but conversely, dehumanizing a person based on sexuality does violate    equality, freedom and human dignity. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now where does the right to sexual <I>pleasure</I>    fit into the equation? Within the discussion of sexual rights and citizenship,    theorists have applied the distinction between a "negative" right    and a "positive" right (Parker, 1997; Petchesky, 2000). The work of    activists and researchers has focused primarily on redressing harm or protecting    women from violence and abuse, where as others have called for a movement towards    a "positive" conception of sexual rights that respects freedom for    sexual diversity and self-expression as fundamental to human integrity (Petchesky,    2000). Positive rights are said to enable the expression of sexual diversity    and pleasure. Recalling the argument that most aspects of human life, thought,    and interpersonal interactions are imbued with sexuality, why keep sexuality    in the closet? Granted that the argument for positive sexual rights assumes    foresight into what types of conditions will enable sexual expression in the    future, after a simple mind experiment it seems that working towards the ethical    obliteration of sexual repression is both integral and true to human existence.    Consider the concrete examples of cultural norms that deny women's sexual pleasure    through female genital mutilation (which can be <I>reframed</I> biologically    as genital excision) or that denigrate women for displaying pleasure during    sexual intercourse. These examples are more clearly imaginable as violations    of human integrity. If we can expand our vision of humanity beyond heterosexuality,    we can make the same argument for denying the ethical enjoyment of diverse non-heteronormative    forms of sexual pleasure. The qualification of enjoyment as "ethical"    here clarifies that conduct we are referring to a form of sexual diversity that    abides by the harm principle (i.e. as long as you are not harming another individual    or her/his autonomous choice then an act can be considered ethical). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">How can a society enforce the right to sexual    pleasure? Again, we stress the fact that our argument is not simply about rights    that are protected by the state (although we do claim that institutions and    laws that repress sexuality cause various forms of harm). The idea of sexual    pleasure, its definitions, its language, its expression, all typically come    from below, from the local context where people experience life. These interpretations    emerge from cultural systems of meaning and significance that are a m&eacute;lange    of popular culture intersecting with elite culture, mechanically reproduced    and ideologically mediated. Social, cultural, religious, bioscience, and other    non-state actors are mainly responsible for respecting the right to sexual pleasure,    again, by abiding by the principles of equality, freedom and human dignity.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some discussions with regard to sexual pleasure    have resulted mainly in activist circles. Although there has been some discourse    about "freedom from coercion, discrimination, and violence", Neha    Patel comments that even in the activist community "the language of sexual    pleasure has been restrictive, fear-based, and limiting", setting guidelines    for normative definitions of pleasure and not about what brings about personal    pleasure because that would be considered "illegitimate" and "indulgent"    (Patel, 2006, p. 67). Some activists, such as Patel, have been working on the    ground level and on the internet to bring about dialogue about how sexual pleasure    influences personal well-being. The South and Southeast Asia Resource Centre    on Sexuality created an e-forum that ran from October to December, 2005 in order    to open a dialogue that gave legitimacy to the sexual pleasure as an integral    part of human life. The discussion, Patel (2006, p. 68) explains, "was    for those interested in critiquing and analyzing the discourses around sexual    pleasure, sexuality and rights". Although there were a variety of participants,    they were limited to people who spoke English and who had access to the internet.    Another difficulty encountered was the "need for a language on pleasure,    &#91;as&#93; many terms related to sexuality do not often translate into local meanings"    (Patel, 2006, p. 68). The subjectivity of sexual pleasure results in a theoretical    as well as in a lived complexity in discussing it as an elemental part of sexual    rights. The tendency of <I>categorizing</I> rights does not easily lend itself    to the multiple and fluid interpretations of pleasure and desire. In analyzing    the discourses collected through this e-forum, several tendencies emerged around    the moralization, normalization, and moderation of sexual pleasure; and more    importantly, some discussants were afraid that an excess in sexual pleasure    would harm others (Patel, 2006). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Positive rights that enable expression and negative    rights that redress harm becomes more theoretically difficult to distinguish    when <I>enabling</I> sexual rights are interpreted as a way to avoid foreseeable    harm (such as the illness and psychological implications of sexual repression)    in the future, thus becoming negative rights that redress harm within a long-term    horizon. We can make this distinction more clearly "when a positive conceptualization    of sexual rights implies that sexual rights are good in and of themselves in    the way that liberty and life are inalienable. In these terms, honoring sexual    rights is justified as celebrating an innate human freedom" (Parker et    al., 2004, p. 374; see also Corr&ecirc;a; Petchesky, 1994; Petchesky, 2000,    2003). The emerging (or evolving) social movement for sexual rights ideally    takes into account both positive and negative rights. Issues such as violence    against transsexuals and rape of women should be redressed through legal as    well as socio-cultural intervention. Sexual education and same-sex marriage    can be categorized more easily as positive rights because they enable the sexual    health of the person (Parker et al., 2004). From an early age, many children    learn that the greatest insult is to be called 'gay' (or 'queer', etc.). The    state has a moral obligation to offer comprehensive sexual education for youth    (Cash et al., 2001) that addresses issues such as the stigmatization of diverse    sexualities in order to enable sexual rights in the future. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As the result of an extended series of consultations    the WHO has developed a set of working definitions of sexuality, sexual health    and sexual rights that have increasingly been adopted by a range of international    agencies (World Health Organization, 2002). These definitions have drawn on    various sources (see Girard, 2004) including international law, international    consensus agreements on sexual and reproductive health and rights, and the work    of a number of experts and organizations in the field of sexuality. These definitions    take a broad approach to sexuality, including topics such as sexual orientation,    sex education, reproduction, and marriage. Within the WHO framework, "sexuality"    is a central aspect of life at all ages and encompasses sex, gender identities    and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy, and reproduction.    Sexuality is said to be experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires,    beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, practices, roles and relationships. While    sexuality can include all of these dimensions, not all of them are always experienced    or expressed. Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological,    social, economic, political, cultural, ethical, legal, historical, and religious    and spiritual factors (World Health Organization, 2002). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The discourses in these domains exemplify cross-cutting    tensions in the field of sexual rights, including the distinction between public    and private spheres, the separation of the church and state, and moral obligations    that derive from the state as well as from civil society (and that permeate    family life), and the difficulties in finding a common language in discussing    sexuality and sexual rights. This discursive complexity impacts sexual rights    'social movements' by obfuscating the framing of principles that are being advocated.    Thus, we have provided a simple overview of several principles and dimensions    that can be included in the category of "sexual rights." The most    important issue is how to consolidate a social movement when there is a clear    gradient with the 'protection of women from rape and violence' on the more conservative    side and with the inclusion of 'sexual pleasure' on other, more progressive,    end of the spectrum. The definition of sexual rights is crucial for strategic    framing and has created some dissonance between those advocating for negative    rights and those who want to push the envelope by including positive sexual    rights. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the last part of this paper, we describe some    of the global and local discussions and action around sexual rights and citizenship.    Before discussing some of the literature on local interpretations and the uses    of this 'sexual rights' framework on the ground, we focus on the international    debate. The organization of this argument addresses the attempts of advocates    to include the terms related to "sexual rights" in official international    dialogues. Although we continue to highlight the importance of grassroots movements    and their role in bringing forth issues that have been categorized as sexual    rights as an ongoing process, the following section reflects on the socio-political    significance of international discourse.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>International contestations over sexual rights</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The participation of non-governmental organizations    within the United Nations and in other international forums increased drastically    from the 1960s to the 1990s. From 1968, when only 53 NGOs participated as consultants    at the Teharan International Conference on Human Rights, the number grew dramatically    to 248 NGOs as consultants and 593 as participants in the 1993 Human Rights    Conference in Vienna, although more than 1,400 NGOs attended the conference    unofficially. Another drastic change in participation was witnessed in the rise    from 6,000 people attending the Mexico City Conference for International Women's    Year in 1975 to the 13,500 people attending the NGO forum for the UN Decade    on Women in Nairobi in 1985. The number of attendants to the Beijing NGO forum    in 1995 grew to 300,000 (Clark; Friedman; Hochestetler, 1998). Not only the    numbers, but the type of participation also changed, from having NGO representatives    as observers in 1968, to the development of organized preparatory conferences    in Nairobi in 1985 (Clark; Friedman; Hochestetler, 1998). The nature of the    international interaction between NGOs also changed, as the power of negotiation    of NGOs from the Global South (including Latin American, Africa and Asia) changed    from listeners and observers to proactive agents, networking and lobbying for    specific issues Notable also were the alliances formed between countries of    the Global North and South. The role of NGOs questioning gender inequalities    became more allied and their participation in drafting conference papers was    stronger. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In 1993, both the World Conference on Human Rights    held in Vienna and the United Nations' Declaration on the Elimination of Violence    Against Women explicitly condemn gender-based violence and related human rights    violations (Gruskin, 2000; Petchesky, 2000; Sadik, 2000). Because they initiated    the international discourse of sexual violence as a human rights violation on    a global level, these are particularly notable references (Petchesky, 2000;    Narrain, 2001). The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD),    held in Cairo in 1994 is recognized as a watershed moment in further developing    the concept of sexual rights by including not only protection from harm but    also hinting at a notion of 'positive rights' (Klugman, 2000; Petchesky 2000,    2003). In fact, the term "sexuality" was first mentioned at the ICPD    conference, where the definition of sexual health was also extended beyond the    decision to reproduce, giving more attention to sexual satisfaction and to the    health of interpersonal relations (Petchesky 2000). The Programme of Action    (POA) produced at this conference recognizes sexual education for adolescents    as important for "positive and responsible" sexual experiences, and    it provides policy recommendations that consider diversity in family structures.    (ICPD 5.1, 5.2; Petchesky 2000). The POA did not mention, however, any concept    of freedom for diverse sexualities, remaining a hetero-centric text (Copelon;    Petchesky, 1995; Petchesky, 2000). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The definition of sexual rights in the international    human rights arena was further discussed at The Fourth World Women's Conference    in Beijing (1995). Although sexual rights advocates pushed for the recognition    of sexual diversity and sexual orientation in the Platform for Action, conservative    delegates prevented the inclusion of a concept of 'sexual rights' that was not    centered on heteronormative values. In the final document the term 'sexual rights'    was excluded and replaced with the 'human rights of women', and the responsibility    and freedom of women to decide in "matters related to their sexuality"    was one of the most significant advances made at this conference. (Petchesky,    2000). Both the conference in Cairo (1994) and in Beijing (1995) undeniably    initiated a discussion about the protection from harm (particularly for women).    But these conferences foretold the discursive difficulties in wording of international    documents that continues until today, particularly around highly polemical issues    related to sexual diversity and pleasure. This begs the question: Are these    battles of discourse reflexive of what people are experiencing, understanding,    and claiming as their 'rights' on the local level? It is perhaps the lack of    credible commitment to the recognition and enforcement of sexual rights on the    global level that makes it so difficult to protect, let alone celebrate, sexual    diversity on the local level. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After the conferences in Cairo (1994) and Beijing    (1995) the debates about sexual rights carried over into a range of follow-up    activities, such as Cairo+5 and Beijing+5 and other intergovernmental meetings.    In Cairo+5, in 1999, the discussions about sexuality education and adolescents'    access to sexual and reproductive services carried over, receiving greater criticism    from delegates from traditionalist and conservative countries (Corr&ecirc;a;    Sen, 1999). In Beijing+5, the opponents of extending the scope of sexual rights    attempted to stall the adoption of a final document, again in order to vanquish    any language addressing discrimination based on sexual orientation and other    issues related to sexuality. When terms such as "gender-sensitive"    or "diversity of women" were mentioned, for example, Islamic countries    demanded a "precise definition" of these terms, because they could    strategically be interpreted to extend rights to homosexuals or open a Pandora's    Box for women's liberation (Corr&ecirc;a; Parker, 2003). One salient strategy    that conservatives use often is to attach issues that clearly threaten the moral    fiber of their constituents&#32;&#150;&#32;for example, by associating the women's    movement with the promotion of prostitution, sex trafficking, pornography, and    pedophilia (Corr&ecirc;a; Sen, 1999; Girard, 2004).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The tensions between the women's movement, the    HIV/AIDS movement, the LGBT movement, on one hand, and delegates from conservative    countries and institutions continued to resurface. In March 2001, when the Commission    on the Status of Women debated 'Women and AIDS" in preparation for UNGASS,    the delegates from the United States emphasized abstinence from sex until marriage    as the most effective way to prevent HIV/AIDS. Once again the politics of identity    fragmentation and targeting was the dominant game played on the international    arena, where debates about what groups should be identified in the text was    a distinct point of contention: Conservatives and traditionalists vehemently    resisted the mention of sex workers, drug user, and men who have sex with men    (Corr&ecirc;a; Parker, 2003). It is counter-intuitive that these groups, which    have been 'classified' as most vulnerable to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, are essentially    excluded and arguably demonized by opponents to sexual rights on the international    arena. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Opponents of sexual rights have proactively attempted    to exclude groups that advocate for sexual diversity from the international    dialogue. A paradigmatic example of the this type of exclusion was witnessed    at the roundtable on Human Rights organized by the Joint United Nations Programme    on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in June 2005, where nine member states officially objected    to the participation of a delegate that represented the International Gay and    Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) and the Health GAP coalition (a group    advocating for access to treatment for HIV/AIDS). After voting, the group approved    the participation of IGLHRC. The resulting document from this roundtable, the    "Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS&#32;&#150;&#32;Global Crisis&#32;&#150;&#32;Global    Action" was considered a step towards the legitimization of the discourse    of sexual rights at the international level, especially since the debates during    this conference were disseminated world-wide through by the media.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In sum, international debates related to sexual    autonomy began with the protection of women from violence, then leading a discussion    on the importance of (hetero)sexual education, and even to some acceptance of    diverse (heterosexual) family forms. But sexual diversity and sexual pleasure    remain silenced and overshadowed by the powers of shaming and repudiation from    traditionalist and fundamentalist 'actors'. These conservative 'actors' include    not only delegates sitting at international conferences discussing particularities    about the wording of official documents, but they sit at the family dinner table,    in community boards and at the head of the classroom. And the global-discursive    level differs from that of lived experience. If the global dialogue has only    begun to recognize the freedom of women over their own bodies, it is needless    to say that the official documents that result from most international debates    still deem non-heterosexual sexualities as dangerous aberrations that belong    nowhere near the discussion table. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There have been few research projects to evaluate    the impact of Cairo (1994) and succeeding conference on sexual and reproductive    rights on the country level. Some analysis does exist assessing the impacts    of Cairo (1994) on policies in several countries with distinct economic, political,    and socio-cultural environments. Hardee et al. (1999) evaluate the progress    of national policy in eight countries, namely Bangledesh, Ghana, India, Jamaica,    India, Jordan, Nepal, Peru and Senegal. Over a five year period using qualitative    methods, the POLICY Project interviewed government officials, academics, donor    institutions, non-governmental organizations, and grassroots groups and health    providers (Hardee et al., 1999). The POLICY Project used indicators such as    the adoption of the ICPD definition of reproductive health, the implementation    of a national program, and the state-level mobilization of resources, and how    services were being implemented in order to qualify the degree to which each    of the case studies adhered to the suggestions of the Programme of Action (Hardee    et al., 1999). The study found that Bangladesh, with the participation of variety    of stakeholders from grassroots groups to the Ministry of Health and Family    Welfare, restructured its previously vertical program to adopt of an "integrated    service delivery system" with a "client centered package of essential    services" (Hardee et al., 1999, p. S3). In India, however the involvement    of non-governmental organizations is limited, opponents to the move away from    the demographic and population based approach thwarted significant efforts to    adopt unfamiliar interventions for sexually transmitted diseases (such as HIV),    and resources were not available to implement free contraceptive measures. In    Nepal, although there was some U.S. technical support, there was little participation    from non-governmental stakeholders. As a representative stated, "Government    does not truly consider NGOs their partners. Such talk is jargon." (quoted    from Hardee et al., 1999, p. S4). Due to lack of financial resources, Nepal    was not able to mobilize a significant reaction to the ICPD recommendations.    In Jordan, a medical technician from the United States claimed that there was    not a real opposition to the reproductive health approach (maternal and child    care). The meaning of reproductive health is misunderstood due to "lack    of awareness", as the medical technician explains that health post workers    "may be baffled if you ask about reproductive health if they have not read    the guidelines" (quoted from Hardee et al., 1999, p. S5). Thus, from this    evaluation it is evident that much of the conversations that resulted at the    national and local level centered on reproductive health, leaving out of the    agenda the more polemical issues related to sexuality and sexual diversity.    The difficulties expressed in understanding international and national jargon    is also noteworthy because local interpretations and programmatic implementation    are what affect people most personally.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>How the global maps onto the local</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While the articulation of sexual rights as part    of international and intergovernmental discourse (on the global playing field)    has been extremely important in recent years, it is also essential to understand    the ways in which locally defined movements, communities and cultures have articulated    their own notions of what we call sexual rights and sexual citizenship. It is    also important to note that the term "sexual rights" is defined, understood,    and articulated in diverse local terminologies. Here we consider several issues    related to sexuality and sexual rights in a few contexts in order to present    diversity and similarities depending on contextual factors. The focus of these    examples of how the global discourse reaches local settings is primarily on    women's sexual and reproductive rights, since the international discourse has    been most successful in including these within official documents. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, feminist networking that occurred in the    1990s due to international conferences allowed local women's rights activists    to access and exchange ideas and strategies or repertoires of contention (Tarrow,    1998) for promoting change across national boundaries, giving them the legitimacy    to affect policies and cultural norms (Alvarez, 2000; Baden; Goetz, 1997). Political    opportunity structures (Tarrow, 1998) have influenced the way that local grassroots    activists have networked. This type of movement of ideas across country boarders    has been referred to as diffusion with reference to social movements (Chabot;    Duyvendak, 2002) and as the formation of ideoscapes (Appadurai, 1996). The exchange    of local cultural realities across boarders can broaden local horizons, potentially    bringing scrutiny to previously unquestioned norms, spurring the growth of collective    identities, inspiring transnational solidarity, and increasing media coverage    of contention. On the flipside, this negotiation between local and global articulations    of "sexual rights" is paradoxical. Because these terms and recommendations    resulted from "incorporating the concerns of very different constituencies    there are today numerous 'others' and multiple perspectives" (Obermeyer,    1999)&#32;&#150;&#32;creating the potentiality of excluding the voices new grassroots    groups and of marginalized NGOs with lesser representation. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In Nigeria, the local women's mobilization (which    emerged partly in resistance to the economic disparities brought about by the    neo-liberal project privatizing public services) has focused primarily on resisting    "the denial of women's political rights, restricted access to justice,    violence against women, the need for reproductive health and rights, struggles    for legal rights and literacy, and against human trafficking" (Pereira,    2002, p. 794). Two major problems that women's groups face are the lack of attention    to these issues in the public sphere and the scarcity in funding to publicize    these problems in order to mobilize the agenda of women's groups (Pereira, 2002).    The impact of international conferences on the visibility and publicity problems    faced by local women's organizations was evident in the National Tribunal on    Violence Against Women, which was modeled after the International Tribunal on    Violence Against Women in 1993 at the United Nations. In this tribunal, women    spoke about their experiences with violence before facilitators and a panel    of judges. This is a prime example of how international conferences can address    local issues head-on. Subsequently, the Legislative Advocacy Coalition of Violence    Against Women (LACAW) addressed violence against women at a national conference    assembled by the International Human Rights Law Group. The purpose of this conference    was to mobilize and network NGOs working against "traditional" norms    that perpetuated domestic violence against women and inheritance rights. The    conclusion of the conference was the formation of a coalition to push for policy    changes, while the group also recognized the importance of changing cultural    norms and administrative processes though community mobilization and raising    consciousness (Pereira, 2002).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Although the case study of women's mobilization    in Nigeria seems largely optimistic, there are several factors that these conventions    and their goals did not take into account, including "differences of identity,    geographic location, age, and economic status" (Pereira, 2002, p. 796).    More importantly, the conventions were criticized for focusing to much on publicity    and not enough on needs assessment. One of the areas that was not acknowledged    was the subject of 'sexual rights', an area that affects primarily young women    and girls (revealing an ageist bias) because there is a lack of <I>education</I>    for young girls on how to claim the right to accept or reject sexual intercourse    (Pereira, 2002). In other words, these national forums focused more on the protection    from harm (negative rights) and avoided discussions about education for young    women (considerably a positive right). The lack of attention to the sexual rights    and health of young girls has strong implications on their vulnerability to    sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition to the neglect for the sexual rights    of young girls, there are other factors such as ethnic cleavages that diminish    the effect of international discourses of sexual rights on local realities in    places such as Nigeria. Politicians in countries with distinct ethnic divides    have a tendency to base political decisions on ethnic identities, which are    highly linked to ideologies of tradition and custom (Pereira, 2002). In Nigeria,    as in many countries, the woman's body carries a heavy burden in the realm of    preserving tradition, and therefore, women's rights are often subverted to the    preservation of tradition as a political strategy (Pereira, 2002). Contextual    factors such as ethnic fractionalization and the citizenship of young women    are crucial in determining the leverage of international mobilization around    sexual rights. In addition, the it is important to note that the notion of protection    against violence is still the prominent platform in most national contexts,    where sexual diversity or pleasure are not legally or culturally acceptable    as rights. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some literature has directly addressed the political    issues involved in the identity politics of southern African nationalism and    the role of organizations that address gender based violence, gay rights, and    sexual health issues (Kraak, 1998). These organizations have challenged patriarchy    and the nuclear family, although solidarity weak due to identity fragmentation    (Kraak, 1998). Contention around the nuclear family is particularly critical    because it not only relates to ideological notions of tradition, but it has    direct linkages to economic policy and government assistance (Kraak, 1998).    This creates a strong tension between the diversity of family forms as addressed    in international discourses and the way that local political, economic, and    socio-cultural realities shape policies related to sexual rights, especially    with regard to systems of patriarchy that thrive on gender inequities.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On a more positive note, the discourse of about    sexuality in the global south has reached the ground not only through internet    forums as described earlier but also through sexuality helplines. Data collected    through the TARSHI helpline, which is based in New Delhi, India, was used to    analyze the language used by men and women to talk about sex and their sexual    experiences and bodies (Chandiramani, 1998). The data presents demographic information    about the callers who use the helpline, frequencies of questions and themes    that callers bring up, as well as information about counselor training, and    call and documentation procedures. The helpline was developed to help women    by providing information and a safe outlet to discuss issues around sexuality.    Although most callers are men, the Chandiramani (1998) argues that the helpline    has effected positive change for women indirectly, providing information and    education to men about issues including basic anatomy, female pleasure, and    sexual violence. In fact, the study found that some male callers and their partners    have benefited from information about foreplay, that they postponed first intercourse    in an arranged marriage until both partners felt ready, and that some women    callers reported being referred by their male partners (Chandiramani, 1998).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After taking a glimpse of what is occurring at    the local and national levels to further the sexual rights <I>agenda</I>, the    language used in international dialogues has served as leverage for policy recommendations.    But as this discourse trickles down through multiple levels of socio-cultural    interpretations, and as it interacts with political and economic structures    (especially at the level of implementation), certain portions of it are prioritized    by diverse segments of civil society. Negative sexual rights have been the priority    of more localized constituencies and grass-roots movements. This is not surprising    considering the level of sexuality- and gender-related violence present in the    world today, in large part due in part to fundamentalists and conservative counter-movements    that have increasingly emerged with dense local networks and focused ideological    agendas. Strategically, the 'sexual rights movement' has tended to prioritize    redressing harms before more (or any) work can be done to celebrate sexuality    as an innate human freedom.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Conclusions and next steps</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this paper we have explored how sexual rights    are dialectically framed through global work as well as how this work is interpreted,    articulated and utilized by emerging local movements and communities where people    are actually experiencing their sexual lives. The extent to which international    definitions and discourses of sexual rights can help to strengthen local mobilization    depends on political and economic opportunity structures, cultural norms, and    the formation of collective identities. We are still left with the question    of whether a 'sexual rights movement' can be forged between different social    movements that are struggling for unique aspects of what falls under the category    of sexual rights as defined by international dialogues. In order to work towards    a more unified movement based on solidarity and social justice, rather than    on the politics of identity, we must continue to extend international networks    as well as deepen local roots. Sexual rights are unique because they are enforced    or denied by the state as well as by religion, culture, science, communities,    and so forth. The advancement of sexual rights therefore requires legal and    formal institutional changes as well as socio-cultural transformations. As with    any right, sexual rights must be protected (or enabled) as well as claimed by    the citizen. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Therefore, a clearer understanding of what constitutes    a sexual right must be constructed by assessing local needs and democratizing    information about the rights and responsibilities of sexual citizens. As part    of a bundle of fundamental rights, sexual rights are often given less priority    to politicians and to ordinary citizens than economic or political rights. We    must avoid the fallacy of conceptualizing sexual rights as separate from economic    or political rights because we can be denied these, more socially enshrined    rights, because our sexualities and our genders are inscribed in our bodies,    beliefs, and actions. Discourses stimulated by activists and academics are defining    an ideal ethics of sexual rights, while in the quotidian many aspects of our    sexualities continue to be strategically repressed. The consolidation of a social    movement around sexual rights, more broadly, will be a longer-term project.    Already the agenda has been identified, if we accept this differentiation of    negative and positive sexual rights. The linkages between elites, international    activists, states, and grassroots movements provides optimism for the formation    of a meaningful social movement advocating for sexual rights with socio-cultural    as well as structural fields of contention.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"> <b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">AFROL NEWS. <I>Desmond Tutu</I>: "homophobia    equals apartheid". 2006.

Abstract The aim of this study is to explore a historical understanding of the constitution of the Spiritual Center and Prayer Service Casa de Jesus &#8211; Fonte de Luz, located in the Amazon city of Rio Branco, Acre state, Brazil. The process of institutionalization of this religious association is investigated with attention to the extent of the social associations developed over the formation of a &#8216;religious devotion&#8217;. Thus, the aim is to show the expression of a religious communalization in its historical process of organization as a form of social interaction. This article is based on ethnographic material gathered between the years 2009 and 2012.

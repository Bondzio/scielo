This article analyzes the expansion of higher education in so-called BRICS countries. The growing aspiration for higher education obliges governments to manage the operational costs of this system. The answers from each country varied with its history, culture and political regime. They all faced similar problems as lack of resources and political power of actors in the higher education system and beyond. Five dilemmas appeared to all countries: (1) expansion, equal access and diversification of enrollment, participation rates, the number and types of institutions; (2) financial constraints; (3) regulation of the private higher education; (4) how to make higher education institutions to provide more accountable to their students, employees and society as a whole; and (5) quality and social relevance of learning and research in higher education institutions. Using data and evidence of the latest research, the article shows common responses, with some exceptions in each case. Institutional diversification; affirmative action; growth of enrollments in the social sciences, humanities, social professions and education; little success in internationalization policies.

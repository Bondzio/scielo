This paper analyses the internalization of political-institutional sustainability indicators in the public policies of eight large and medium-sized cities in Southern and Southeastern Brazil. This is done through the analysis of formulation and implementation of public policies with socio-environmental characteristics. The eight cities -São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Joinville, Vitória and Uberlândia- were chosen on the basis of containing proposals regarding environmental issues in their local political agendas.

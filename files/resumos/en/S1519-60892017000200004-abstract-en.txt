Abstract: This article analyzes the main insertion strategies adopted by Senegalese migrants who have arrived to Buenos Aires in the last two decades. The focus is on the factors that affect them, i.e. the characteristics of the group and of the destination city. The research methodology has been qualitative, based on in-depth interviews with the Senegalese group, as well as participant observation in public spaces. By understanding the migration process as a total experience, this article aims to analyze the obstacles and strategies involved in the integration of the migrants, which involves some particular characteristics and some experiences before and after their departure.

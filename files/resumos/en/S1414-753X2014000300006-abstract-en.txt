According to Brazilian environmental law, agroforestry systems (AFS) are an alternative to restoration and use of legal reserves (RL). However, since AFS comprises very heterogeneous practices, it is pertinent to discuss whether and which systems are adequate to fulfill de functions of these protected areas. This paper presents relevant elements and considerations to these questions, based on literature review. The literature indicates that the value and potential of AFS for conservation are limited and controversial; AFS's sustainability and benefits depend on their structure, diversity, management and the surrounding landscape. Therefore, it is essential to establish criteria and limits to use AFS in environmental restoration and exploitation of RL that consider the degree of conservation and the extent of RL and be based on studies about the ecological/environmental feasibility of these systems in a long term.

Recent researches have revealed the importance of the rental market in the poor areas of large Brazilian cities for the access to housing of the low-income populations. The dynamism of this market in the Metropolitan Region of Recife was highlighted by the research on the functioning of the housing market in poor areas (2005 - 2012). Based on the results, some questions were made with respect to the changes in the urban and environmental structures from the dynamism of this market and if these changes would not be contributing to the environmental degradation of these settlements. Therefore, this paper aims to analyze the urban transformations, generated by the mentioned market and its environmental implications, having as object of study Brazilia Teimosa, where the housing market showed greater dynamism when compared to other localities studied.

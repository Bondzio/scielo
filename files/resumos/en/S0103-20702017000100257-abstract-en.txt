Abstract In this paper we analyze the dialogue between football and nationalism from a somewhat dissimilar methodological regarding our bibliographic history: we not focus on the analysis of each nation separately. To do this we will put our focus on the symbolic exchanges between national narratives constructed by the Argentine and Brazilian fans during the World Cup Brazil 2014. This paper has two sections: the first attempt to systematize some relevant reflections to think football and world cup as privileged land where the global local-read tension can be study. In the second section we move to the analysis of the songs deployed between Argentine and Brazilian fans during the World Cup 2014.

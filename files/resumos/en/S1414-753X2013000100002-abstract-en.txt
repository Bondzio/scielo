This work presents an analysis of the scientific production about sustainability in ecology and economy areas in the period between Rio92 and Rio+20. The focus is in the stress between disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity in the context of the establishment of the relation between scientific artifact and politic propositiveness. Thus, this study analyzed fifteen articles among the twenty five most quoted articles in the website "web of Science" both in ecology and economy, regarding "sustainability" and "sustainable" topics between 1990 and 2009. The analysis was founded in the theory of reflective modernization and in social studies of science. Finally, this study suggests the existence of a "disciplinary interdisciplinarity" between economy and ecology that facilitates its connections and operations; however it also hinders the insertion of socio-cultural elements to the debate.

This article, based on the concept of "social recognition" and the issue of the creation of a "sense of injustice", analyses recent policies for the teaching career, through documents and measures taken at the Federal, State and Municipal levels. The underlying discussion has to do with enhancing the value of teachers in the current social and educational situation in Brazil. Career plans and their relation to teachers' professional lives in states and municipalities are discussed, as well as these plans' relation to quality in education. The analyses lead to the conclusion that the issue of the social recognition of these professionals is still affected by the raised problems, which explains the increasing sense of injustice pervading the profession. However, the study founded that there is a movement in various spheres of public educational management, which is concerned with the career plan for the teaching profession, although the movement is not yet wide-ranging and has not shown so far any real impact.

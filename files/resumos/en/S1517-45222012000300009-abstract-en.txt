Exercising citizenship means to be aware of one's own transformative and emancipatory role, to be committed to equality and to sharing a collective project. The new citizenship does not diverge from it, although it adds the component of a collective co-construction. It allows for expanding relationships - both mutual and with the State - as well as for exercising citizenship at the local level, by strengthening the channels for civic participation and thus establishing a new co-participatory and more democratic setting.

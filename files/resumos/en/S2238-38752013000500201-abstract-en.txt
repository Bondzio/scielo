Abstract This article examines the urban dynamics of neighborhoods undergoing gentrification, particularly the neighborhood of Wazemmes, located close to the center of Lille, in Northern France. Significant changes occurred in Wazemmes in the last decades. The neighborhood became a cosmopolitan space joining a population of great diversity. It was subjected to publicaction in a variety of domains, affecting mainly the social and cultural registers. Wazemmes changed from being an infamous space associated with delinquency and danger because of the strong presence of immigrants to an emblematic place now esteemed for its urban and ethnic features.

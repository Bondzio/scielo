Part of Certeau&#8217;s reflection on everyday life on the city is an invitation to perceive the defiant and poetic forms of appropriation of the urban space, through what he called tactics, what is understood as the art of the weak.

For this reason, this article suggests adopting the emblematic city of Venice as the empirical experience meant for a blind reason, because it has a contradictory everydaylife, a kind of anti-city amidst global flows of people, goods and capital.

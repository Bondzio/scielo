This paper aims to discuss the relationship between space and identity construction, taking under consideration the urban environment through social practices that form what will be called here the identitary places: portions of public space defined by their significance and cultural position, formed from singular and subjective coding-decoding processes and understood from social relations, fixed aspects, flows and speeches. From these concepts, is presented in the end a supplementary proposal for the classic Milton Santos model, associated with the construction of a new semantic system, in a complementary way to the objects system and actions system proposed by the author.

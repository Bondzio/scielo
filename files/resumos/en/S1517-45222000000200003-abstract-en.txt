This article is an attempt to answering the question of whether flexibility as a cultural model has established itself in Uruguay. We examine flexibility at three levels. Firstly, within labor policies seen as social policies and the legal mechanisms implemented in order to established them. The second level is that of the collective actors linked to production, the use they have made of available legal mechanisms and the direct and indirect consequences they have had over regulating mechanisms. At the third level, the individual actors are examined, along with the way they have taken flexibilization of those regulating mechanisms and the reflectivity they had to take facing the new scenarios posed by these processes of change. The article concludes with an interrogation on the possibilities that Uruguay is in a point of no return in terms of flexibilization of labor relations.

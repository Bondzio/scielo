Abstract This article discusses the socio-environmental conflict ensuing the association between the development of industrial networks' strategies by the CSN Group (Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional) and the emerging forms of social contestation and contentious politics in the steel and mining localities of Volta Redonda (RJ) and Congonhas (MG). The main argument emphasizes the importance of these forms of social embeddedness in conditioning economic action, considering mostly the innovative nature of integrating issues of environment and labor in the investigated territories.

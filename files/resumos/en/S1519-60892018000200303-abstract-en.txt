Abstract: This article aims to analyze the ways in which certain officers and political movements acting in defense of cultural policies imagine the border area between Brazil and Uruguay as a common cultural space. The fieldwork on which this analysis is based was carried out with agents who called themselves militants of the culture and different cultural agents who live or work in this frontier area, among which are musicians, poets, filmmakers, documentarists, media producers, among others. Officers and political movements are indistinguishable when one observes a tendency of simultaneity between the cultural activism and the professional affirmation. We analyze these specific ways of acting in defense of cultural policies aimed at the frontier area. It is intended to discuss how the border as a symbol is mobilized in political and professional activities of these agents and what are its effects on social and local and regional political dynamics.

Abstract: Memory and utopia translated into theatrical language renew the apprehension of the relationship between drama and social experience. In &#8220;A moratoria&#8221; (1955) and &#8220;Rastro atrás&#8221; (1966), the remembrance of Jorde Andrade&#8217;s family decline nurtures the characters sayings and the objects surrounding them, a sample of the family and of the rural class history to which he belonged. Gianfrancesco Guarnieri&#8217;s &#8220;Eles não usam black-tie&#8221; (1958) woke up the dreams of the young generation towards the potential of culture&#8217;s contribution to a better society. The working class protagonists performed for the first time in the metropolis&#8217; stages through a family drama overwhelmed by the strike, the generational conflict and the class struggle. All this higlights the decisive role of the theatre in a changing moment of Brazilian culture, besides the rise of &#8220;cinema novo&#8221;, proving the connection between the theatre, the radio and the beginning of television in the country.

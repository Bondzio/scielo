Themain thesis of this work is that for U.S. government policy of globalwar on terror offered him an opportunity to pass up from a logic of single securitization towards macrosecuritization one in addressing the problems from the proliferation of drugs and the presence of guerrillas in Colombian case, and the problems of transnational crime in the case of the Triple Border Area (TBA) in the Southern Cone. In other words, problems related to drug trafficking, guerrillas and transnational crime in both places were treated less like process with dynamic autonomous and subordinate to the macrosecuritization that the doctrine of the global war on terror had brought. However, although the United States has had some success in macrosecuritization in Colombia and TBA, in both cases there is a paradox in the emerging outcomes ofU.S. policies: the successful macrosecuritization not correspond to a successful securitization.

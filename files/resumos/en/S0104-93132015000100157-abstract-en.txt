The historical analysis of the last Argentine dictatorship reflects an agreement about the negative effects (political, economic and social) of the regime. There are few positive appreciations of that period. This is the case, however, with some voices linked to the National Atomic Energy Commission, which emphasise certain decisions, circumstances and processes regarding the nuclear policy of those years. However, that is not the only way to remember what happened between 1976 and 1983 in this techno-scientific institution. Other voices evince interpretative tensions surrounding this period, making explicit the open-ended nature of this institution's history. These tensions invite analysis focusing on memories of the dictatorship, particularly memories of some technological decisions on nuclear development, the uses of public funds that was made by the institution during that period and the effects of military violence upon it

ABSTRACTMarx saw the proletariat as the revolutionary class. Today, authors like Guy Standing argue that the proletariat, as a specific "class", is giving place to the new (non) class of the precariat. Given that the Marxist project of a revolution led by the proletariat is still to happen, can the precariat be(come) the new agent of change, in a context marked by a neoliberal turn within the capitalist system? In this paper we will try to answer this question: on the one hand, by exploring the dialogue between Marx and Hegel, on the other hand, by exploring the relationship between the precariat and the neoliberal phenomenon.

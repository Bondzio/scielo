Abstract This article focuses on the understanding of &#8220;prostitution&#8221; in the transborder Amazon city composed of Tabatinga (Brazil), Leticia (Colombia) and the island of Santa Rosa (Peru), and on the ways that this &#8220;prostitution&#8221; is implied in the &#8220;process of frontierization&#8221; and in the transborder life. My hypothesis is that this &#8220;prostitution&#8221;, its forms, flows and relations, are present as a small synecdoche of the multiactantial process of the effectuation of border and of gender; a privileged and spectacularized profile of the multiple connections that produce this border, through which we can trace resonances, memories and derivatives of an always improbable totality. This articulation arises from an ethnographic study conducted in this city between 2011 and 2015, about the relations between border, Amazon, gender, money and sexuality, especially in the local transborder sex markets.

This article analyses the special processes of the National Home Research Samples (PNAD) micro data relative to the occupations of rural families in the state of Paraná between 1992 and 1999. The data show growth in the number of families working in non-agricultural activities, a reduction of the number of families working in exclusively agricultural activities, and growth in the number families headed by pensioners and/or retired people. It is possible to assume that the Paranaense rural environment is experiencing a type of "urbanization" and increasing transformation in the housing area. Further information leads us to conclude that an important reduction in the universe of Brazilian family agriculture is occurring.

ABSTRACT The article discusses the crisis of neoliberal capitalism and the alternatives that open from it. In order to do so, it proposes a contrast between two ways of coordinating the institutions of capitalism - economic liberalism and developmentalism - and the concept of a &#8220;class coalition&#8221; to understand the different modes of its social and political support. As part of the contrast has in view the historical fact of globalization, the text submits it to a critical revision, to accentuate its geopolitical dimension. This allows us to analyze, in a way that the authors consider more interesting, the crisis of developmental capitalism in the post-war &#8220;golden years&#8221; and the reasons for the advent of neoliberal rule. Finally, taking into account the emergence of a regressive alternative to the contemporary crisis - the so-called &#8220;right populism&#8221; - the article examines the possibilities and limits of a developmental, democratic and social alternative compatible with the globalization process.

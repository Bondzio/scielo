ABSTRACT This article provides a review of the academic production that has aimed to analyze the causes of the process of privatization of education in Argentina. It presents eight paradigmatic explanations that summarize the different interpretations and theoretical constructions that have emerged in the last twenty years regarding privatization, and identifies their achievements as well as empirical and hermeneutical limitations. The last section offers a structural explanation that draws on some of the elements present in other explanations while re-signifying micro-political processes that, due to their undeniable inter-temporal consistency, demonstrate the existence of a State policy of privatization.

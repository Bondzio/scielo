Abstract From the archaeological excavations undertaken in the remnants of Terreiro da Gomeia (Duque de Caxias/RJ) and narratives collected with former members of the site about its operation and succession crisis, this article aims to discuss the memory dispute in the construction of narratives about the place, its operation, crisis of succession and destruction. Gomeia was one of the candombl√©s of Rio de Janeiro with a singular trajectory, having worked from 1951 until 1971, when its leader passed away and an inheritance crisis began. The formation of three strands on these facts demonstrates how memory is political and aims to justify certain points of view and positions. The recollections collected by interviews will be used as support for the construction of the archaeological interpretation about the end of the terreiro.

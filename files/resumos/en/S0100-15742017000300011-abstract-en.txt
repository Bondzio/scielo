ABSTRACT The science-technology-society-environment approach is becoming one of the recommendations for teaching science since it is best supported by research in didactics, what means that it must be part of the official curricular documents. Thus, an analytical instrument was constructed and used to understand whether the basic education curriculum guidelines are in line with the perspective of teaching sciencetechnology- society-environment. The qualitative analysis performed shows that this approach is integrated into curricular documents, although a more meaningful approach would be desirable. These documents still do not sufficiently take into consideration the aspects related to the nature of science, namely the reciprocal relationships science-technology-society-environment.

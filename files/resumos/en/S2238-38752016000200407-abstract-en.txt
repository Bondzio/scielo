Abstract This article proposes an anthropological reading of the broad participation of Folklore studies and the categories used by Folklore scholars in constructing the meaning and dynamics of the Fandango, a popular cultural expression in the Southern and Southeastern Brazilian coast, particularly the states of Paraná and São Paulo. Taking the Fandango as a reference, the work and research carried out by Mário de Andrade, Renato Almeida, Fernando Correa de Azevedo, Inami Custodio Pinto, Alceu Maynard Araújo, Rossini Tavares de Lima, and others are revisited. The analysis aims to illuminate the different conceptions and projects held by these authors regarding issues, strategies and practices typical of Folklorism such as patrimonialization, regionalism, risk, rumor and rescue. I propose, in addition, a reflection on how each of them, in his own context and manner, articulated Folklore Studies with the fields of the Arts and Social Sciences.

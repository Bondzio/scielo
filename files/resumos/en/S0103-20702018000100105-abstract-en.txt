Abstract Contemporary forms of work in countries like Portugal and Brazil are faced with multiple modalities of precarious employment. After a brief theoretical reflection on precariousness and the regulation of precariousness, this article sets forth comparative research on operators&#8217; perceptions of the work process in two telecommunications call centers, one in Portugal, the other in Brazil. We argue that despite the different pace of economic performance in recent years in Portugal and Brazil, the trend toward casualization and standardized behavior has been the norm in both call centers.

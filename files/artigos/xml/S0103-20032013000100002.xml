Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The development    of biogenetics has introduced a new competitive paradigm in the seed sector.    Any seed may be viewed as a technology vector composed of different characteristics,    being the GM seed a specific case where one or more attributes are not normally    attainable by the species under natural conditions. Nowadays one can think of    a GM seed that is simultaneously tolerant to a particular pesticide, resistant    to certain types of pest and filled with specific nutritional attributes. Since    the genetic traits that produce each of these characteristics may result from    R&amp;D efforts made by different firms, the seed plays the role of a platform    that matches interests of multiple players namely a biotech company - or group    of companies - and their customers, the farmers and the food consumers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first GM soybean    seed marketed in Brazil in the 1990s/2000s incorporates the genetic trait that    creates tolerance to the herbicide Roundup, whose active ingredient is glyphosate<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>.    Value is added with the adoption of GM soybean seeds based on the reduction    in production costs - due to lower consumption of agrochemicals - and the small    price difference between GM soybeans and conventional ones. On the other hand,    the use of GM seeds requires paying royalties to Monsanto, the company that    owns the technology and captures part of the value<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally speaking,    although royalties constitute the return associated to the innovation, it is    quite common for innovators to lament the fact that imitators have profited    more from the innovation than the firm that made the development effort (Teece,    1986). In the case of soybeans, the existence of self-reproducibility - i.e.,    transmission of genetic traits between generations<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a>    - makes this issue even more emblematic because farmers can potentially reuse    a soybean grain as seed for future seasons. As the soybean grain contains the    genetic innovation and it can be used as a seed, the self-reproducibility makes    the cost of capture of property rights on biotechnology innovations greatly    reduced. Farmers capture property rights through the reuse of a grain crop as    seed for the next season or the purchase of brown-bagged seeds.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The possibility    of capture of property rights reduces the ability of biotech firms in appropriating    the value generated by the biotechnology innovation. Accordingly, firms undertake    protection. The basic hypothesis of this paper is that such efforts vary depending    on the institutional environment. The current paper examines the governance    of property rights on GM soybean seeds in different contexts. Specifically,    the article undertakes a comparative analysis on the collection of royalties    in GM soybean seeds in the U.S. and Brazil. For each country, we describe the    regulatory framework governing the protection of biotechnology innovations in    agriculture and investigate the strategies for protection of property rights    in GM soybean seeds. The paper also provides econometric evidence linking the    capture of property rights on biotech innovations in GM soybean seeds by farmers    and the protection mechanisms deployed by biotech firms. The results suggest    that, subject to the institutional environment, the firm may choose to transact    the GM attribute apart from the seed, building governance structures that frame    around the attribute and not around the seed as a whole. These results have    interesting implications for the analysis of complex assets since they broaden    the analytical framework that is usually applied to the study of governance    structures.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The paper is divided    into four parts besides this introduction. The next section briefly discusses    the received knowledge in relation to biotechnology innovations in agriculture.    Section 3 undertakes a comparative institutional analysis on the collection    of royalties in GM soybean seeds in the U.S. and Brazil. Section 4 then provides    econometric evidence that furthers the comparative analysis. Section 5 presents    the conclusions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>2. Knowledge    received</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As outlined by    Zylbersztajn et al. (2007), the literature on property rights in biotechnology    innovations is profuse. Lesser (1998), for instance, explored the effects of    property rights on agricultural industry structure. Alston and Venner (2000)    studied the effects of plant variety protection law on research investments.    Kesan and Gallo (2005) investigated the relationship between property rights    and the firms' incentives to invest in seed varieties. In general, this literature    is built on an implicit assumption: a strong institutional environment is a    necessary condition for profitability in the agricultural biotechnology industry.    As a corollary one may state that, due to the existence of self-reproducibility,    the solution to the problem of appropriating value in soybean seeds requires    the existence of a strong legal system that enforces protection of property    rights on genetic innovations even after the marketing of the seed<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, recent studies    find evidence that the operation of the market for GM soybean seeds can occur    even under weak property rights, suggesting that strong regimes of intellectual    property protection are not a necessary condition for the emergence of biotech    firms. Wright and Pardey (2006), for instance, note that the rapid dissemination    and adaptation of genetically modified seeds have taken place in developing    countries even before the effectively adoption of intellectual property protection    regimes.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In another study,    Goldsmith et al. (2006) apply a critical case study approach to Pioneer-Argentina    and test the arguments traditionally associated with the impact of weak systems    of property rights on the seed market. The results suggest the existence of    an interrelationship between the homogeneity of product demand and the protection    of intellectual property rights. Overall, the firm manages its supply of soybean    seeds in order to maximize profits in a second-best world through the minimization    of costs and the complementarities between soybean and corn.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Enders and Goldsmith    (2007), in turn, argue that biotech companies can achieve profitability in weak    institutional environments if they adopt alternative strategies with respect    to monopolistic pricing. The authors analyze the options for maximizing profits    of U.S. biotech firms which operate in the relatively weak institutional environment    of Argentina. Enders and Goldsmith (2007) identify three strategies: (i) to    focus efforts in lobbying to improve intellectual property protection before    entering the market. But, in the meantime, the biotech firm fails to profit    from innovation, losing the opportunity to capture a market share; (ii) to enter    the market using the traditional business model based on the institutional environment    in the U.S. In this case, however, complaints about the abuse of property rights    may encounter a "deaf ears" by the national authorities; or (iii) to develop    an alternative strategy which incorporates the heterogeneity of institutional    and business opportunities (second best strategy). The authors discuss the strategies    of dynamic pricing<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a>, tying    and the application of genetic technologies of use restriction (i.e., introduction    of genes that promote the sterility of the plant).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a general rule,    the above studies suggest that the appropriation of value on biotech innovations    in GM soybean seeds is not irreversibly tied to the existence of a strong institutional    environment. Goldsmith et al. (2006) and Enders and Goldsmith (2007) discuss    this issue in terms of strategic choices within a North/South (U.S./Argentina)    debate. While this dichotomy broadens the analytical perspectives commonly associated    with the analysis of property rights in GM soybeans, in this paper we argue    that the value of the U.S./Argentina debate is limited. Specifically, Goldsmith    et al. (2006) and Enders and Goldsmith (2007) do not consider the existence    in Brazil of a more complex scheme of collecting royalties in GM seeds.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to perform    the analysis, the current paper examines the collection of royalties on GM technology    in Brazil, highlighting its difference with the U.S. case. Particularly, the    article contrasts the collection of royalties in GM soybean seeds in the U.S.    and Brazil taking into account a specific GM attribute (tolerance to glyphosate).    The next section presents a historical analysis of property rights on plants    in the U.S. and Brazil, and investigates the economic rationale that guides    the collection of royalties on GM soybean seeds in each country. Section 4 then    provides econometric evidence linking the capture of property rights in GM soybean    seeds by farmers and the protection mechanisms deployed by biotech firms.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>3. Comparative    institutional analysis</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This section conducts    a comparative institutional analysis of the U.S. and Brazil. For each country,    we describe the regulatory framework governing the protection of biotechnology    innovations in agriculture and investigate the strategies of protecting property    rights in GM soybean seeds.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>3.1. U.S.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The U.S. through    the enactment of the Plant Patent Act (PPA) in 1930, was the first country to    offer a specific intellectual protection for plants. The act allows the provision    of patents for new varieties of asexually reproduced plants (except tubers).    Under the legislation, breeders have the exclusive rights to reproduce, sell    and use the patented plant and its progeny for a limited period of time.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1970 intellectual    property protection was extended to sexually reproduced plant varieties through    the enactment of the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA). The PVPA states that    plant varieties that meet the criteria of novelty, distinctness, uniformity,    and stability<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a> become eligible    to receive a Plant Variety Protection Certificate through which the breeders'    rights are safeguarded. Originally the PVPA allowed the farmers to save and    negotiate seeds with other parties. This configuration lasted until 1994 when    an amendment to the act removed the right of farmers to sell saved seeds provided    that the plant is protected by a Certificate. The amendment, however, upheld    the right of farmers saving seed for their own use (farmers' exception).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1980s an    important change took place when the granting of utility patents for firms in    the biotechnology sector became possible<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a>,    extending patent protection for specific genetic traits and biotechnology tools.    Nowadays a GM seed has three components capable of patent protection: (i) the    plant germplasm (i.e., the seed itself), (ii) the sequences of genes or genetic    traits that result in a specific, external change in a given organism, and (iii)    the research tools necessary for incorporating the new genetic trait in the    plant cell (UNCTAD, 2006). The granting of utility patents for biotech firms    is relevant to the extent that the seed may be understood as a platform composed    of different attributes which result from R&amp;D efforts made by different    firms. Currently a single seed can tie up a number of patents each of which    protects a specific attribute.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is worth noting,    however, that the granting of a patent on a genetic trait is only the first    step in the effort to protect property rights. Because soybean is characterized    by self-reproducibility, users' cost of capturing property rights of technology    innovations is small. Farmers capture rights by reusing the grain crop as seed    for the next season or by purchasing brown-bagged seeds. In the face of this    problem, the U.S. biotech firms structure their protection efforts around the    establishment of contracts in the form of technology agreements and the use    of the legal system to enforce them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Technology agreements    are used by most biotech firms<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a>.    In general, each purchasing of GM soybean seed is under a contract that limits    the use of the seed to a single crop and restricts<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a>    the saving of the harvest for future planting. Contracts stipulate prices, agronomic    recommendations, penalties, and incentives to a particular culture or seed.    In most agreements, the companies spell out the record numbers of their patents    and the laws that ensure its protection. The agreement provides a limited use    license which means that the firm allows the use of the gene by the farmer,    but does not hand over its property to him.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the specific    case of GM soybean seeds commercialized by Monsanto, the agreement makes it    easy for the firm to investigate the farmer's activities. It allows Monsanto    to study information collected by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) for any area    cultivated by the farmer, including the analysis of aerial photographs and receipts    for purchase of seeds and agricultural chemicals. Access to such information    helps Monsanto to determine how many bags of seed a farmer has purchased and    how many acres of land were planted with a particular type of culture (CFS,    2005). The agreement also contains a provision that allows Monsanto to examine    and copy any records and receipts that may be relevant for monitoring the performance    of the farmer.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is interesting    to note that the provisions of the technology agreements are not free of tension.    UNCTAD (2006), for instance, identifies three points of dispute between biotech    companies and farmers: the principle of exhaustion, the extension of the scope    of intellectual protection, and the inconsistency between legal rules. In what    follows, we briefly describe each of these elements<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most schemes of    intellectual property protection include a general principle called the "doctrine    of exhaustion for sale" or "doctrine of first sale". According to this principle    an intellectual property right is typically exhausted by the first sale or the    marketing of the assets subject to protection. Based on this principle, American    farmers argue that biotech companies lose control over their genetic traits    when selling the GM seeds, making invalid any contractual restriction on the    act of saving seeds. The courts, however, state that the general rules of patent    exhaustion do not apply in these cases because the transaction is governed by    a technology agreement through which the biotech firm allows the farmer's use    of the gene, but does not give it to him.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another line of    reasoning maintains that biotech firms, by means of the restrictions imposed    by licensing agreements, are capable of expanding the scope of patent protection.    The point is that although the company holds the exclusive right to a particular    genetic trait, it cannot regulate other features of the seed. However, the licensing    agreement actually restricts the use not only of the genetic trait originally    protected, but also of the germplasm (i.e., the seed itself). Once more, the    argument has been rejected by the courts. In Pioneer vs. Ottawa (2003)<a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14"><sup>14</sup></a>    the court concluded that a restriction against resale of patented seed represents    an assertion of exclusive rights granted by the patent law and not an attempt    to increase the scope of the patent.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, restrictions    associated with licensing patents may contravene the provisions of the Plant    Variety Protection Act. In particular, restrictions on saving seeds conflict    with the farmers' exception. In this respect, the Federal Circuit<a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a>    sustained that patent owners right to prohibit the act of saved seeds even where    such restrictions contradict some aspects of the PVPA.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The discussion    above tells us that the courts have consistently upheld biotech firms' property    rights. This finding highlights the second element that supports the protection    of economic rights in the US: the use of the legal system.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If technology conditions    are such that the cost of capture of property rights is sufficiently high, a    law favorable to biotech firms - supported by an active, stable judicial system    - is expected to reduce firms' protection cost. Given the high cost of capture    and the effectiveness of the judiciary, capture attempts occur less frequently    and thus less protection efforts is required. Nonetheless, since the cost of    capture of property rights on GM innovations in soybeans is small, biotech companies    must use more complex schemes of monitoring and enforcing technology agreements.    Monsanto, for instance, created a department composed of 75 officials that consumes    US$ 10 million annually whose sole purpose is to ensure the protection of property    rights (ENDERS and GOLDSMITH, 2007). This is interesting because it reveals    that the recourse to the legal system neither represents a set of fuzzy legal    claims, nor takes the form of an omnipresent threat that, by itself, automatically    reduces the intensity of the capture attempts. <i>The protection of property    rights requires an organizational structure</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of    Monsanto, the operation of such organizational structure has resulted in the    filing from 1997 to 2007of 112 legal claims involving 372 farmers and 49 small    associations<a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a>. As shown    in <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t01.jpg">Table 1</a>, approximately 51%    of the legal claims resulted in the recognition of damage to Monsanto, 21% resulted    in agreements, 12% were rejected (no indication whether any damage was awarded)    and 16% had not been completed. In the case of conviction of the farmer (i.e.,    recognition of damage to Monsanto), compensation ranged from US$ 5,000.00 to    US$ 3 million. The average penalty was approximately US$ 385,000.00 (CFS 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>3.2. Brazil</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was only in    the second half of the 1990s that Brazil began to design a regulatory framework    for granting property rights to plants and regulating genetically modified organisms    (GMO). The first law was passed in 1995, being known as the "First Biosafety    Law" (Law nº 8,974/95). This law in conjunction with Decree 1,752/95 created    the National Technical Committee for Biosafety (CTNBio) to be in charge of passing    judgment upon proceedings related to GMO activities.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One year after    the creation of CTNBio the patenting of GM organisms was enabled by the Law    of Industrial Protection (Law nº 9.279/96) passed in 1996. According to the    law, the whole or part of GM organisms are patentable provided that it meets    the principle of novelty, results from an inventive activity, has some industrial    application, and does not represent a mere discovery<a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a>.    In general, a biotech firm in Brazil may gain a patent on a genetic trait and/or    a biotechnology tool which points out that the Law of Industrial Protection    is similar to the concept of utility patent.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1997 Brazil    became a member of the International Union for Protection of New Varieties of    Plants (Upov)<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a>. In the    same year, the Law of Cultivar Protection (Law nº. 9,457/97) was approved. This    law is similar to the Plant Variety Protection Act in that it benefits the breeder/developer    through the recognition of ownership rights related to new plant varieties.    The law not only establishes the right of temporary monopoly on the commercial    reproduction of new plant varieties, but it also grants small farmers the right    to save and exchange seeds (farmers' exception).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In view of the    above regulatory framework Monsanto obtained in 1998 CTNBio's permission to    market GM soybean seeds tolerant to glyphosate<a name="top19"></a><a href="#back19"><sup>19</sup></a>.    But, the authorization was revoked by the judiciary in 1999 in the face of a    legal claim filed by the Brazilian Institute for Consumer Protection (Idec),    a non-governmental organization. Firstly, Idec claimed that the authorization    granted to Monsanto was groundless because CTNBio supposedly failed to request    an environmental impact assessment (EIA) specific to the Brazilian conditions<a name="top20"></a><a href="#back20"><sup>20</sup></a>.    Secondly, and more importantly, Idec claimed that the power originally conferred    to CTNBio with the purpose of authorizing the marketing of GM seeds was in contradiction    to the responsibilities of local governments and municipalities to regulate    environmental issues. As a result, the marketing of GM seeds was banned until    the enactment of the "New Biosafety Law" (Law nº 11.105/05) in 2005.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the ban    on planting GM seeds, farmers - especially in the southern region of Brazil    - have illegally adopted Monsanto's technology through the smuggling of Argentinean    soybean seeds from 2003 to 2005<a name="top21"></a><a href="#back21"><sup>21</sup></a>.    As indicated in <a href="#g1">graph 1</a> which shows the consumption trend    of saved and brown-bagged soybean seeds in the state of Rio Grande do Sul (southern    region of Brazil), the year of 2003 marks an increase of 44% in the demand for    the seeds.</font></p>     <p><a name="g1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02g01.jpg"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is interesting    to note that the prohibition in domestic marketing of GM seeds along with the    illegal import of seeds from Argentina restricted the property rights protection    strategies available to biotech firms. There was no basis for legal action for    recovery of royalties since the presence of GM seeds in the domestic market    was legally prohibited. This lack of basis for royalty collection, however,    did not last for long. In 2004 the Brazilian market was flooded with GM grains    whose existence in the national market was not authorized. In the face of this    problem, and considering the large soybean production, the Brazilian government    decided to implement a series of legal measures that allowed ex-post the planting    of GM seeds<a name="top22"></a><a href="#back22"><sup>22</sup></a>. If adoption    of GM seeds is legally permitted and farmers effectively adopted it, then firms    may establish mechanisms for recovery of royalties (ZYLBERSZTAJN et al., 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of    Monsanto, the collection of royalties had to cope with two aspects. On the one    hand, it had to be retroactive because farmers had already harvested the GM    soybeans. On the other hand, it would be based on seeds purchased on the black    market. As described in <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02f01.jpg">figure    1</a>, the collection of royalties was based on three components: (i) the existence    of an inexpensive field test for the detection of genetic traits in soybean    seeds, (ii) the design of a contract involving three parties, and (iii) the    establishment of a credible threat.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since farmers in    the southern region of Brazil are numerous and the adoption of the technology    had already occurred, Monsanto would face a high monitoring cost if it decided    to negotiate individually with each farmer. However, since the harvested grains    have to be transported to cooperatives, processors, and trading companies, the    monitoring cost in this stage of the production chain is comparatively lower.    Consequently, due to the existence of an inexpensive field test, Monsanto was    able to identify the presence of the genetic trait through genetic analysis    of soybean shipments carried by trucks into the cooperatives, processors, and    trading companies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monsanto then established    a difficult process with the four largest trading companies operating in the    southern region of the country. The biotech firm proposed that traders collect    the royalties on the genetic technology based on the ton of soybean grain delivered    by farmers, keeping a percentage of the royalties as incentive compensation.    Initially, the traders decided not to cooperate. Nevertheless, the resistance    was offset by a credible strategic move made by Monsanto. Supported by international    laws for the protection of property rights<a name="top23"></a><a href="#back23"><sup>23</sup></a>,    the company intercepted a ship in the port of Trieste, Italy, carrying a large    shipment of Brazilian soybeans. For fear of exposure, the trading companies    agreed to negotiate. For the same reason, cooperatives and processors also decided    to collaborate with the biotech firm. As a result, Monsanto was able to structure    a royalty collection scheme based on a contractual arrangement.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A contract was    designed so that each farmer had the freedom to state what type of technology    had been used on his property. If the farmer declared that he had used GM seeds,    a charge was laid and its value was reduced from the payment made to the farmer    by the cooperative, the processor, or the trading company. If the farmer did    not declare the adoption of the GM technology, the field test was conducted    on each shipment delivered by the farmer. If the test was positive for the presence    of GM seeds, the farmer had to pay a fine and bear the costs of the test. Given    the widespread adoption of GM seeds and the risk of penalty, 98% of farmers    in the southern region of Brazil agreed to the arrangement (ZYLBERSZTAJN et    al., 2007)<a name="top24"></a><a href="#back24"><sup>24</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, the analysis    of the mechanism of collecting royalties on GM soybean seeds in the southern    region of Brazil reveals a subtle phenomenon. The property rights protection    effort undertaken by the firm is based on the unbundling of the attribute (tolerance    to glyphosate) from the asset (seed), outlining a particular way to negotiate    about the attribute regardless of how the asset is acquired. This is relevant    since the collection of royalties is based on seeds purchased in the black market.    The result contrasts with the U.S. case, where all the protection effort made    by Monsanto focuses on combating the saving of seeds.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the above    argument might suggest that the strategy implemented in the southern region    of Brazil is more efficient than that established in the U.S. since the firm    is able to collect royalties on the technology even in the case of saved seed,    it is worth noting that the contractual arrangement structured in Brazil is    more complex than the filing of legal claims. The arrangement entails the coordination    of multiple agents and different transactions. In fact, as soon as the problem    of illegal seed acquisition became less intense, Monsanto altered its strategy    of collecting royalties. This is the case of the Midwest of Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The major soybean    producing states of the Midwest of Brazil are Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) and Mato    Grosso (MT). Industry sources say that GM soybeans represent 80% of soybean    production of Mato Grosso do Sul and 40% of soybean production of Mato Grosso<a name="top25"></a><a href="#back25"><sup>25</sup></a>.    Generally speaking, the Midwest has two distinct characteristics relative to    the southern region of Brazil with regard to soybean production. Firstly, the    average farm size in the Midwest is bigger than that of the south. A typical    rural property in the state of Mato Grosso, for instance, has approximately    8,000 acres compared to 2,000 acres in Rio Grande do Sul (VEIGA and ANTUNIASSI,    2008). Secondly, in the Midwest the adoption of GM technology has been slower    than in the south. In the south, smuggled GM seeds spread rapid due to the similarity    of climate and soil between the region and Argentina. In the Midwest, rapid    adoption has not occurred due to the need for adaptation of seed varieties to    the "cerrado" environment. This type of environment has specific climate and    soil which make the planting of a seed originally intended for Argentina far    from the most favorable choice. Perhaps more importantly, the climate in the    Midwest can cause deterioration of stored seed if specific conditions such as    cold storage system are not met. These conditions, in turn, raise the cost of    saving seeds. As noted in <a href="#t2">Table 2</a>, after a peak of 80% in    2003 the consumption of saved and brown-bagged seeds in the state of Mato Grosso    do Sul decreased faster than in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.</font></p>     <p><a name="t2"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t02.jpg"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Midwest    the collection of royalties from GM seeds occurs by means of payment slips which    are delivered to farmers by cooperatives or dealers at the time of seed purchase.    Initially, Monsanto had stipulated that the value of the royalty should be R$    0.88 per kilo of seed (approximately U.S.$ 0.38). Subsequently, the value was    set at R$ 0.50 per kilo (U.S.$ 0.23). These amounts, however, were never charged.    In the 2006/07 and 2007/08 seasons, when the system was effectively put into    practice, the royalty paid by farmers was R$ 0.30 per kilo of seed (U.S.$ 0.17)    which is equivalent to 27% of the value of the soybean seed bag. In the 2008/09    season, the royalty was set at R$ 0.35.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of    non-payment of the slip, under the assumption that the farmer is reported in    the field test for detection of GM traits, Monsanto can charge a default rate    of 2% on production. This default rate, however, is not necessarily applied    to the whole production. The scheme works as follows: Each payment slip generates    a certain amount of "royalty credits". When performing the field test and verifying    the farmers' total production, Monsanto compares the amount of credits accumulated    by the farmer and the actual level of production. If production exceeds the    equivalent amount of credits, the farmer pays a fee of 2% on the excess. The    logic of the scheme is simple. If the farmer has not only acquired a certain    amount of GM seeds, but also used saved seeds there is an incompatibility in    the harvest period between actual production and ideal production - i.e., the    production obtained by the exclusive use of seeds purchased legally. It is this    inconsistency that Monsanto checks<a name="top26"></a><a href="#back26"><sup>26</sup></a>    and the rate of 2% levied on the difference between actual and ideal production.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note that the stability    of the mechanism of collecting royalties in the Midwest of Brazil is still an    open question since the relationship between Monsanto and the farmers in the    region is not free of tension. Industry sources say that in light of agronomic    advances, there are soybean varieties that demand a smaller quantity of seed    per acre which reduces the value that farmers are supposed to pay Monsanto and    this enables Monsanto to recover royalties that are not due to it. Currently    discussions are moving towards selecting the best time for collecting the royalties.    Farmers suggest that royalty be charged close to the harvest period when it    becomes possible to more precisely measure the effective yield of the crop.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>4. Royalty collection    schemes and the farmers' reactions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present section    aims to deepen the comparative results of the strategies of protecting property    rights discussed above. It provides econometric evidence linking the capture    of property rights on biotech innovations in GM soybean seeds and the protection    mechanisms deployed by biotech firms. In particular, we analyze the influence    of royalty collection strategies on the incentive for farmers to save or acquire    brow-bagged GM soybean seeds<a name="top27"></a><a href="#back27"><sup>27</sup></a>.    In what follows we present a panel estimation to the Brazilian market of GM    soybean seeds and seek similar econometric evidence for the U.S. soybean market.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>4.1.

The dependent variable corresponds to the size    of brow-bagged and saved soybean seed market measured as a percentage of the    total market of soybean seeds<a name="top30"></a><a href="#back30"><sup>30</sup></a>.    It is noteworthy that estimates are based on aggregated data by states, since    there are no available microdata. The independent variables include the region    of production, the introduction of GM seeds in the country<a name="top31"></a><a href="#back31"><sup>31</sup></a>,    the changing in the institutional environment through the enactment of the New    Biosafety Law in 2005, the price of certified soybean seed, the introduction    of contracts in the southern region of Brazil and the issuance of payment slips    in the Midwest of the country.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally, it is    expected that the consumption of brown-bagged and saved soybean seed be greater    (i) in the southern region compared to the Midwest and (ii) following the introduction    of GM seeds in the country. Consumption also tends to be greater the higher    the price paid for certified seeds. Particular interest is placed on analysis    of the estimated coefficients for 'contracts' and 'payment slips' since it represents    the protection strategy implemented by the biotech firm. The estimation also    considers three control variables: the price of soybean paid to farmers, the    price of glyphosate-based herbicide, and the availability of rural credit. In    the model, farmers' choice is conditioned on lagged values of the prices of    seeds, soybean, glyphosate, and credit amount, reasoning that the prices in    the previous period affect farmers' decision today<a name="top32"></a><a href="#back32"><sup>32</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In regard to the    estimation method, the first two columns of <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t03.jpg">Table    3</a> identify, respectively, fixed effects estimate and random effects estimate.    When conducting the tests for the significance of fixed and random effects,    one finds that both are significant (see <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t03.jpg">Table    3</a>). The Hausman test, in turn, cannot be computed due to a violation of    asymptotic testing hypotheses. Since the estimates are roughly equivalent, the    random effects model is more attractive. By employing a generalized least squares    estimator (GLS) this model provides the best linear unbiased estimator, which    is consistent and asymptotically efficient when it is assumed that the error    of the regression model is uncorrelated with the independent variables (Balgati,    2005).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the residuals'    variance, the results indicate the presence of strong heterogeneity among the    cross-section units. In order to account for such, heterogeneity we estimate    a model using the White correction (third column of <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t03.jpg">Table    3</a>). The Wooldridge test for autocorrelation, in turn, does not indicate    the presence of first-order serial correlation in the panel. Nevertheless, one    should be aware of the presence of specific autocorrelation within the data.    The Q-test indicates first-order serial correlation for seed price and the participation    of brown-bagged/saved seeds in the states of Mato Grosso, Parana, Rio Grande    do Sul and Santa Catarina.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, since    the number of time units in the panel is greater than the number of states,    one way to test the independence between units of cross-section is the LM test    developed by Breusch and Pagan (1980). As shown in <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t03.jpg">Table    3</a>, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of independence at 5% significance    level. This result, however, should not be taken at face value. On the one hand,    there are strong reasons to assume that the soybean market and the use of brown-bagged/saved    soybean seeds are correlated between different states - e.g., the effects of    random shocks may affect the soybean market with no regional differences. On    the other hand, the Breusch-Pagan LM test requires that the number of cross-section    units in the panel be fixed and the time dimension to tend to infinity. The    current model, however, is based on eight units of cross-section and only 14    years. Thus, <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t03.jpg">Table 3</a> presents    two GLS estimations, the first assuming independence between the units of cross-section    (I) and in the second the units are contemporaneously correlated (II).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It should be emphasized    that the use of GLS estimation in the current case is not free of problems.    As observed by Beck and Katz (1995), the use of generalized least squares can    generate upward biased estimates of standard deviation, leading to a greater    likelihood of rejection of the hypothesis of insignificance of the estimated    coefficients. This result derives from the fact that the ratio of the temporal    dimension to the number of cross-section units in the panel is near to unity    so that the estimation of the covariance matrix of contemporaneous errors is    based on slightly more than three observations per estimate<a name="top33"></a><a href="#back33"><sup>33</sup></a>.    Thus, <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t03.jpg">Table 3</a> also presents    an estimation based on Prais-Winsten method. By this method one accounts for    the presence of heteroscedasticity, contemporaneous correlation between cross-section    units and autocorrelation AR (1) specific. The difference between GLS and the    method of Prais-Winsten is that the latter is based on a specific correction    for the standard errors of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate<a name="top34"></a><a href="#back34"><sup>34</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When analyzing    the results of the Prais-Winsten estimation, three points should be underlined.    Firstly, states in the Midwest tend to brown-bag/save on average 15% less soybean    seeds compared with other Brazilian states. This result, as previously discussed,    can be attributed to the soil and climate of the region which increase the cost    of saving seed. Secondly, the introduction of GM technology in Brazil has increased    the consumption of brown-bagged/saved soybean seed in the southern region of    the country by 17%. This result relates to geographic conditions which facilitate    the saving of seed and to the smaller size of rural properties - and consequent    greater proximity between farmers - which facilitates the establishment of a    black market for seeds once GM seeds have been smuggled from Argentina. Thirdly,    raising the price received for soybean tends to reduce the current demand of    saved seed by 0.6%. The interpretation of this result may be intricate; it can    be argued that the higher income generated in the previous season can encourage    farmers to purchase a larger quantity of certified seeds in the current period,    indicating an 'income threshold' from which the consumption of certified seeds    becomes larger.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The GLS estimation    (II) in accordance to the above discussion produces a larger number of significant    coefficients. The estimation suggests that the introduction of GM seeds in the    country also encouraged the brown-bagging/saving of seeds in the Midwest, although    at a lower level (5% in the Midwest compared with 18% in the southern region).    The promulgation of the New Biosafety Law also led to an increase in market    share of saved seeds, suggesting that changing the legal regime has encouraged    the adoption of GM technology. Regarding glyphosate, the rise in its price indicates    extra reduction in the demand for certified seeds, suggesting that farmers seek    to establish a stable disbursement with the package composed of GM seed and    glyphosate. These results, however, are subject to the criticism advanced by    Beck and Katz (1995).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A crucial point    regarding the estimations is that the variable 'contract' is non-significant    in all estimated models. This result should come as no surprise since the mechanism    of royalty collection in the southern region of Brazil does not depend on the    acquisition of the seed. As discussed, the collection of royalties is based    on seeds purchased in the black market. The variable 'payment slip', in turn,    is significant and negative in the GLS model (II), suggesting that the collection    scheme established in the Midwest is successful in reducing consumption by farmers    of brown-bagged and saved seed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>4.2. Econometric    evidence in the U.S.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to build    a comparative analysis for the U.S. we seek similar econometric evidence for    the U.S. soybean market. In the American case, our estimates are based on the    participation of brown-bagged/saved seed market in 14 states<a name="top35"></a><a href="#back35"><sup>35</sup></a>    between 1997 and 2002. A regression model similar to that shown above is estimated.    However, unlike the variables 'contract' and 'payment slip' the estimation uses    the number of legal claims brought by Monsanto against farmers. In particular,    we analyze the cumulative size of legal claims. This variable not only represents    the protection strategy of the biotech company, but also seeks to capture the    effect of legal action over time<a name="top36"></a><a href="#back36"><sup>36</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly to the    Brazilian case, the first two columns of <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t04.jpg">Table    4</a> present the estimates of fixed effects and random effects for the U.S.    soybean seed market. Although both fixed and random effects are significant,    the Hausman test indicates that the second estimator is consistent. Additionally,    heteroscedasticity is present and the first-order autocorrelation in the panel    is absent. This combination suggests the estimation of a robust model presented    in the third column of <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t04.jpg">Table 4</a>.    Regarding the independence of cross-sectional units, since the number of states    in the panel is larger than the number of time units, the Breusch-Pagan LM test    loses its effectiveness and one should estimate a Pesaran test. The test result,    as shown in <a href="/img/revistas/resr/v51n1/02t04.jpg">Table 4</a>, suggests    that cross-sectional units are independent. Once again, we do not take this    result face value. Thus, we also estimate a model using the Prais-Winsten method<a name="top37"></a><a href="#back37"><sup>37</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, White    and Prais-Winsten estimates give similar results. The market share of brown-bagged    and saved seeds is explained mainly by the price of soybean and the rate of    adoption of GM technology. Regarding the price of soybean, it is interesting    to note that the result to the U.S. market is the opposite of that obtained    for the Brazilian market, i.e., raising the price of soybean tends to increase    the farmers' current demand of saved seed in approximately 1%. One may speculate    that the higher income generated in the current season encourages farmers to    save seeds as a safeguard for future rise in the seed price.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main result    of the estimations, however, is that the sign of the correlation of rate of    adoption of GM technology with market share of brown-bagged/saved seeds is negative.    This result is not surprising when one notes that the estimation directly addresses    only one of the two elements that form the basis of the protection strategy    of biotech companies in the U.S. market, namely the appeal to the legal system.    The estimate does not explicitly take into account the formation of technology    agreements contracts. Nonetheless, since each transaction for the sale of GM    seeds involves the establishment of a contract, the adoption rate of GM seeds    is a natural proxy for the adoption of such agreements. In that sense, what    the estimates reveal is that the formation of contracts is one explanation for    the reduction of brown-bagging/saving of soybean seeds, suggesting that the    U.S. institutional environment is strong enough to create incentives for compliance    with the terms of the contracts.

Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Property rights    over genetic innovations in soybean seeds are subject to capture because the    biological characteristics of the seed - i.e., self-reproducibility - place    such innovations in the public domain, creating the possibility of capture of    value. As a result, firms undertake protection efforts by means of developing    organizational arrangements in order to minimize the capture of value. The above    discussion suggests that such organizational arrangements are dependent on the    institutional environment in which the purchasing of the seed occurs.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the U.S. where    the institutional environment is strong, the firm undertakes protection efforts    based on the establishment of technology licensing contracts along with the    use of the legal system. In general, econometric evidence suggests that the    establishment of contracts represents a fundamental component of the strategy    of protecting property rights. The analysis also suggests that the use of the    legal system does not assume the form of an omnipresent threat that, by itself,    automatically reduces the intensity of capture attempts. As shown, the protection    of property rights requires a specialized organizational structure.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, the    firm holding the technology found a way to collect royalties even in a situation    where the institutional environment is weak. The solution involves two distinct    governance structures: the introduction of contracts in the southern region    of Brazil and the issuance of payment slips in the Midwest of the country. The    similarities between these governance structures are that (i) the firm ensures    its rights by exercising a deliberate, active monitoring role and (ii) the attribute    "tolerance to glyphosate" is transacted in separate from the asset (seed)<a name="top38"></a><a href="#back38"><sup>38</sup></a>.    The unbundling of the attribute from the asset indicates that the firm prefers    to internalize the allocation function that is usually associated to the market.    Accordingly, a firm's efforts of protecting property rights involve the building    of governance structures that are organized around the attribute and not of    the asset. This is relevant in that the institutional environment encourages    the firm to directly handle the transaction of the attribute.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The combination    of the above arguments suggest a more general proposition: when the transaction    of the attribute is disconnected from the transaction of the asset, the firm    loses in economies of scale<a name="top39"></a><a href="#back39"><sup>39</sup></a>    but gains in efficiency of the protection of property rights, given the possibility    of capture of these rights and the quality of the institutional environment.    This proposition has interesting implications to the analysis of complex assets    since it broaden the analytical framework that is usually applied to the study    of governance structures. Under the lens of this expanded framework, governance    structures emerge with the deliberate purpose of protecting property rights    associated with certain attributes of an asset, while disregarding other less    valuable attributes. We should consider that the more genes are marketed for    specific crops, each with different ownership, the more complex the protection    mechanisms will be. Future research should seek to deepen this subject, both    theoretically and empirically.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>6.

<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="back1"></a><a href="#top1">1</a>    A first version of this paper was presented at the 15<sup>th</sup> Annual Conference    of the International Society for New Institutional Economics (Isnie) at Stanford    University, California, U.S., June 2011. The authors appreciate the comments    of Yoram Barzel, Elizabeth M. M. Q. Farina, Paulo Furquim de Azevedo, Sergio    Lazzarini, Ana C&eacute;lia Castro and Maria Sylvia M. Saes. All errors and    omissions remain our responsibility.    <br>   <a name="back4"></a><a href="#top4">4</a> The soybean tolerant to glyphosate    (RR soybean) allows the application of glyphosate for most of the harvest's    life cycle. The impact of this innovation should be noted: before the advent    of RR soybeans the farmer could only use glyphosate before the germination of    the soybean plant, using other kinds of herbicides after its germination (post-emergent    herbicides). Because RR soybean is tolerant to glyphosate, post-emergent herbicides    can be replaced by the glyphosate. Accordingly, the RR soybean seed is complementary    to the glyphosate and the bundle composed of RR soybean seed and glyphosate    is a substitute to the bundle composed of conventional seed and post-emergent    herbicides.    <br>   <a name="back5"></a><a href="#top5">5</a> The impacts of adoption of GM seeds    on farmers' decisions and costs have been studied by Alexander et al. (2003)    and Alston and Marra (2003).    <br>   <a name="back6"></a><a href="#top6">6</a> Seeds characterized by self-reproducibility    are called non-hybrid seeds. On the other hand, hybrid seeds are those in which    transfer of genetic traits to future generations does not occur or occurs only    in a limited way.    <br>   <a name="back7"></a><a href="#top7">7</a> Kesan and Gallo (2005), for instance,    assume that the protection afforded by a patent is sufficient to mitigate the    capture of value in non-hybrid seeds.    <br>   <a name="back8"></a><a href="#top8">8</a> Dynamic pricing strategy refers to    the condition in which the biotech firm sets a high price in the first period    of commercialization of a new GM seed, reducing the price in subsequent periods.    <br>   <a name="back9"></a><a href="#top9">9</a> These criteria aim to ensure that    the new plant is characterized by a progeny having the same characteristics    as the original plants. Note that these criteria are expendable in the case    of asexually reproduced plants because in this case the original genetic material    is transmitted directly to future generations.    <br>   <a name="back10"></a><a href="#top10">10</a> The grant of utility patents for    biotech firms dates back to two different moments. In "Diamond vs. Chakrabarty"    (1980), the Supreme Court concluded that a particular bacterium generated by    genetic engineering could be patented because it represented the result of human    research and not the discovery of a "natural species". In "J.E.M vs. Ag. Supply    Pioneer Hi-Breed International" (2001), the same logic was applied to the case    of a GM plant, resulting in the extension of patent protection for plants obtained    by genetic engineering.    <br>   <a name="back11"></a><a href="#top11">11</a> Maxwell et al.

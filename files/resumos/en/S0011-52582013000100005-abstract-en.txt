The theoretical premise defended by this article is that the contents of equality are specified and transformed according to a society's structural and historical conditioning factors. To argue this hypothesis, the article draws on the results of three studies in Chile, showing that two relevant effects are shaped in the interface between the wave of expansion of the principle of equality in recent decades and society's own characteristics: the rise of new demands for equality, with social ties as their main mechanism of expression, and the deepening of the denouncement of a particular kind of inequalities (defined here as interactional).

This article aims to analyze the change in the last book of Francisco Alvim, O metro nenhum, compared to previous works, especially Elefante, in which the lyrical poetry do not directly address the "social constraints of our system" (Roberto Schwarz), that the most critical realist author's poems deal with. The analysis focuses mainly a composition as "A m√£o que escreve", in which both trends are perfectly fused. What favors this merge is also self-analysis of the intellectual in the face of the heavy moral and social heritage of slavery.

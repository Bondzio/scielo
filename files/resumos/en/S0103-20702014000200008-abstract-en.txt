The paper showcases some methodological peculiarities found in Anthony Giddens" theoretical project, structuration theory. The diagnosis is that it has less influence in current social theory than it could have. The cause of this problem is identified in the ontological transition made by Giddens in the end of the 1970s, which, unintentionally, ends up weakening the theoretical-methodological foundations of his project as a whole. A methodological reconstruction is suggested, based on Mary Hesse's model of philosophy of science, to help solve this problem.

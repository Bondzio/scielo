AbstractThe aim of this article is to analyze the practice of lobolaor "bridewealth" by the zulu people in South Africa like a "gateway" through which they negotiate theirs forms of belonging to a home/family. This negotiation is held by the way the number of cows - 11 - that shapes thelobola is reached in a complex arithmetic game. I conclude that the partial payment of lobolaor even its absence gives rise to forms of belonging and an ontology very different of the one reached for a "fully loboled" woman. In turn, this difference cannot be understood through the current idea of illegitimacy of the children produced outside the marriage.

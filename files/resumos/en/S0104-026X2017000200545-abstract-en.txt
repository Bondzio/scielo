Abstract: This research analyzes gender relations and the construction of male teaching in early childhood education, comprising of how male teachers are chosen and integrated in this stage of school education. The theoretical anchor is supported by Gender Studies, and the research approach is qualitative. We interviewed three male teachers from different municipalities of Rio Grande do Sul state, who were working in early childhood education schools. The analysis showed that men face difficulties by choosing this profession, which is standardized as being for females. In spite of this fact, some men resist, negotiate, and keep working in this activity, demonstrating that masculinities are multiple and plural, built through the challenges and possibilities that teaching in early childhood education produces.

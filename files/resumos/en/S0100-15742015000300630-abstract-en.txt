This paper proposes a dialogue of the contemporary issue of transexuality in schools, based on some concepts of the philosopher Michel Foucault, in order to reflect on the issue through the device of sexuality, of one of its shifts, i.e., the device of transexuality, as well as on the biopolitical agency of the school which aims to control and regulate the trans/trav bodies and subjectivities. The research also discusses the use of social names by transvestites and transexuals in schools; seen, on one hand, as an achievement by social and identity movements and, on the other hand, as a biopolitical strategy of the government to control the bodies and the processes of subjectivity of such individuals. Finally, it presents a challenge in relation to the possibilities to escape the biopolitical agency from the school.

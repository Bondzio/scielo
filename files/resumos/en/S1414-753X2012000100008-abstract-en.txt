This article analyzes a socioenvironmental conflict in the municipality of Caravelas, Bahia / Brazil. The studied conflict emerged from the proposal for the establishment of what would become the largest shrimp farm in Brazil. The proposed area for the establishment of the shrimp farm was part of an important socioeconomic and environmental region associated to the Abrolhos Coral Reef Bank. It assumes that the lack of public policies that define the parameters of the decision-making for financing shrimp farming projects has allowed the establishment of shrimp farms along the Brazilian coast, without pointing sustainable productive alternatives, which consider the generation of employment and food production. The qualitative methodology adopted participant observation and fieldwork aiming to identify the environmental damage associated to shrimp farming and relate them to factors that contribute to the perpetuation of these predatory model and for the establishment of resistance movements in order to identify local potentialities and possible paths for a sustainable social and environmental management.

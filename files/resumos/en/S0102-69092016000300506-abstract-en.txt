Science and technology policies have adopted innovation as a priority, formulating more favorable laws and programs in order to reinforce the links between universities and companies. The study analyses the institutionalization process of commercial appropriation of science through scientific practices diffused within the Brazilian academic scene. It is argued that, despite the incentives created by recent scientific policies, the new market oriented values and practices have not been incorporated without resistance by the academic community. The research showed that the innovation policies had direct implication on the behavior adopted by the university in what comes to the mechanisms for interfaces with firms, and that the effectiveness of those policies depends deeply on the scientific orientations of the social actors involved in such process.

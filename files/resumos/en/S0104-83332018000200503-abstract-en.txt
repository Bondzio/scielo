Abstract This article presents a study about strategies of resistance against femicide in the postmodern novel &#8220;Vozes do deserto&#8221; (2004), by Nélida Piñon. This work, in addition to reviving the Arab imagery, describes the feminist struggle of Scheherazade, for freedom and for the end of the execution of the Caliph's wives. This enables a profound debate about female sacrifice as part of a social structure of maintaining male power through gender violence. This power is imposed by harassment, physical aggression, and the tyranny of the execution of wives and companions when outside the moral standards imposed by the patriarchal values, according to the anthropological studies of Rita Laura Segato, Henrietta Moore and Lia Zanotta Machado.

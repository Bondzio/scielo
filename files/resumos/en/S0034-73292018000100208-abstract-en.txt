Abstract The Euro crisis led to a blurring of the two main decision-making procedures in the EU: the intergovernmental and the Community method. By analyzing the Six-Pack, this paper reflects a new decision-making method - an intergovernmental-supranational method. Furthermore, it tests the premises of the new integration theories: the new intergovernmentalism and the new supranationalism.

AbstractIn this paper I intend to discuss briefly different approaches to diaspora as an analytical category, highlighting the problems of the semantics of the term that has spread in recent decades. Immediately, I will analyze the most important conceptions in Judaism about the Promised Land, exile and diaspora. Finally, I will describe the changes in recent years among different segments of the Jewish Diaspora in their relationship with the State of Israel and with the host societies as a result of a marked process of de-Zionation.

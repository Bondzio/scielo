Choosing freely motherhood and its calendar was a central and unanimous claim of the women's lib in the seventies. First, women and professionals belonging to the medical circle fought together to make contraception and abortion available. Nevertheless, feminists have been divided before reproductive technologies that could allow to delay pregnancies: would this medicalization of procreation contribute to emancipate women from time constraints or, on the contrary, contribute to lock them into a maternal destiny? This paper will try to shed light on this problem by discussing IVF social experience in France during the last two decades.

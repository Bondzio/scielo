Metropolitan areas face increasing problems of urban sprawl. Simultaneously suffer an emptying of properties and depending on the prior use, may exhibit contamination of soil and ground water. The article aims to evaluate the urban density, availability of sanitation infrastructure and socioeconomic status of the neighborhood to check the potential for urban redevelopment and reoccupation of contaminated areas in the city of SÃ£o Paulo. Through GIS the Cetesb database for the year 2010 with the addresses of the contaminated areas was georeferenced and census tracts with information Censo/2010 as household density, access the sewage system, garbage collection, and income were dichotomized between those with and no contaminated areas. The differences between of median and quartiles of these variables were compared. The city had 1,190 registered as contaminated areas, distributed in 5.1% of its census tracts. Census tracts with contaminated areas have lower household density and greater access to the sewage system, solid waste collection and performance compared to sectors without contaminated area. The census tract with contaminated areas have higher sanitation infrastructure, however, have a lower density of households. Despite the effort to reoccupy these areas, there is still great potential for growth in these areas in the city.

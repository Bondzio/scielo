This article presents the results of research that has the goal of proposing a curriculum for initial training, created from the experiences of teachers who work in schools located in areas of high social and economic vulnerability. It includes six case studies from the region of Bío-Bío, Chile. Data collection used the technique of communicative group discussion, and in the analysis, the transformative and exclusionary dimensions of the communicative methodology itself were distinguished. The results obtained show the curricular requisites that may suggest a proposed curriculum for initial transformative training.

During my ethnographic research with the group of Palestinian refugees resettled in the Mogi das Cruzes - SP, issues related to memory have made present from the first contact. At a time in which individuals were seeking to start a new life, talk about what they had lived was always constraint by a strong emotional charge or an attempt to erase. Between forgetting and trying to live a new life and to share and make the others understand what they have experienced in the past, was the difficulty of dealing with the traumatic memory. Although they had experienced similar situations and for many years shared the same reality in the refugee camp where they were hosted in temporary shelters - between 2003 and 2007, when they were resettled in Brazil - each of refugees opted for a different dynamic. This article aims to discuss these mediating structures and the relationship between traumatic memory and memory of trauma in the daily experience of Palestinian refugees in Mogi das Cruzes.

Abstract Based on fieldwork conducted in a well-known African matrix religious house called Gantois, this article presents the concept of enredo &#8211; a Portuguese term derived from rede (literally, net). In doing so, the article considers some of the ways in which this term often operates in the religion of candomblé in Salvador, the capital of Bahia State, Northeastern Brazil. The central argument is that the frequent use of the term enredo reflects a mode of existence that is always multiple, a relational model that is intrinsic to candomblé, and that its use as a concept is suggestive of how we might understand a fundamental aspect of African matrix religions in Brazil.

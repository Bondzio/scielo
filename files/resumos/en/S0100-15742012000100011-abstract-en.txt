The data collection methodological design consisted of observation, semi-structured interview and recall stimulation interview. According to the perception of the participant teachers, the research has valued their teaching practices by recognizing their knowledge and stimulating them to take upon themselves all of their potential as an active and reflective professional. In relation to the research on teachers' formation, we highlight the importance of making the teachers' voices heard, through reports where they think upon their practices.

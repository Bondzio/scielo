This paper explores the specificities of the early stages of Machiavelli&#8217;s reception in England. Studying original sources pertaining to said reception, it deals with the XVI and XVII century editions of the Discourses on the first decade of Titus Livius, with their prefaces and presentations considered in parallel with the dissemination of his ideas. It argues that, unlike the events in the continental Europe at that time, the commendable and pioneering arrival of the Discorsi, together with the political environment of the country, provided a view of Machiavelli as a defender of freedom and good government. Despite extensive bibliography on the subject, this period has not yet been given due attention &#8211; especially regarding its comparison of Machiavelli&#8217;s fame in Italy itself to the editorial dissemination of his works. Religious criticism notwithstanding, his works suffered more due to the natural law theories during the middle of XVII century, and thus English Machiavellianism decayed.

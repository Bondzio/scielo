Abstract: Studies of gender in the XIX century have privileged women writers. To approach these discourses there are several theories in the literary and feminist fields. However, this incidence of class, race, sex in gender relations and in the formation of feminine subjectivities is a theme which has been less studied. In this article I aim to relate these concepts with a focus on Black and Brown-skinned slaves, without abandoning the wider social interpretation. The written sources on this issue are fragmentary, in addition to distortions suffered by the interpretation of a third person: public prosecutor, liquidator of slaves, scribe and even historians and editors who participated in the organization of these written sources. The study presented deals with the processes of transformation of gender relations and feminine subjectivities with the unusual increase in the number of slaves in the nineteenth century Cuban.

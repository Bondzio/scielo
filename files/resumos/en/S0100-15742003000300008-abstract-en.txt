The aim of this paper to analyse, from a historical point of view, the debate between two mathematics teachers in the beginning of the 1930's. At that time the first National Education Law was created (Francisco Campos Reform), including, in all schools of the country a single curriculum. In it, a discipline denominated "Mathematics", wich was the result of an articulation of the independente branches of arithmetic, algebra and geometry should be taught. The protagonists of the discussion were Júlio César de Mello e Souza (1895-1974) and Jacomo Stávale (1881-1956). The analysis of this event provides an understanding about how it possible to Brazilian's schools daily routine to incorporat, more than twenty years before this controversy, the first proposal of internationalalization of Mathematics teaching.

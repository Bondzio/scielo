Abstract: This article reflects on a TV series called Mulher (Woman), exhibited by Rede Globo in 1998-1999, in Brazil, targeting female audiences. Particular attention is drawn to the intense social merchandising related to medical and preventive health matters throughout the series. The story of two gynecologists, depicted by means of a melodramatic and comic narrative, promotes messages on female health, valuing ideas concerning the care and medicalization of the body. This text discusses two aspects: the social context as well as the specific period in open TV broadcasting in which this series was produced; and how medical and technological issues are presented. In order to interpret the series&#8217; content, the merchandising process as well as its use of a certain melodramatic narrative structure is analyzed.

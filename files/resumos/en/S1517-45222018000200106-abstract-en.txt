Abstract This article aims to examine the revolutionary potential of art by looking into the relation form / content within the aesthetic dimension, assuming that, if revolution resides in another world, one that is envisaged before being built, it is important to approach it through mental representations, which the artist is able to engender, turning them from content into form. The text proposes, particularly, to analyze the relationship between art and politics, based on the stance taken by Julio Cort√°zar at the time of the Cuban revolution, on the matter of the artist's modes of political commitment as a Latin American intellectual. A stance that illustrates the postulate of Herbert Marcuse, that the political potential of art lies in its aesthetic dimension.

Abstract In Brazilian society there is an increasing concern about cultural differences in various social contexts. However, in regards to school education, it is possible to notice the feeling of not knowing how to deal with these issues in a positive way. This study aims at analyzing the relationship between school and intercultural practices. A course that was inspired in an action research that took place in the first semester of the year 2014 was used as reference. The goal of this course was to incorporate the intercultural perspective in the school routine. As a result, we found that to advance on this matter, it is important to bring the intercultural perspective into our ongoing training within the school space and routine.

In the context of modernity, work as praxis has been placed in the field of Economic issues. However, the discourses that construct it as a research problem tend to attribute a set of normative elements and values that are not consistent with the structure and the "rules of the game" of the labor market in the capitalist system. In this article, we revisit some theoretical approaches to the relationship between Work and Culture in moral terms, in the context of the capitalist regulation of the relations of production. To this end, we take some elements of Emile Durkheim´s social solidarity theory and its rereading in the work of Jürgen Habermas. Based on these, we propose possible analytical approaches to the systemic needs for integration between distinct fields such as Labor and Moral, considering a fragmented and exploitative labor world. Finally, we discuss the need to conceptualize the relationship between Work and Morality both in terms of solidarity and of contention.

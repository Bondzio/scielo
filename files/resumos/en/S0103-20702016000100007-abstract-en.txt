ABSTRACT Focusing on the empirical connections and on the analytical interrelations between cultural production, cities and gender, the article intends to achieve a triple purpose: to map some theoretical models being used in the analysis and in the interpretation of those realities; to argue about a specific bibliography concerning the cities, the artistic language and the social experience; to analyze the intertwining of such dimensions in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, from 1940 to 1960, mainly through the dramatists in a comparative approach with Florence, Paris and Buenos Aires. Viewing the cities as cultural arenas, as "the place of birth, of experiments and of cultural struggle" (Morse), the article shares the idea that "the cities and their representations are entangled" (Gorelik) and upholds the argument that specific cultural manifestations happen in specific cities according to social conditions, to the potential resources and to the constraints involving the creation, the authorship, the language and the gender relations.

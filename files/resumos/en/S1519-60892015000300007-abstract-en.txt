Abstract: Starting from a movement called &#8220;decolonization&#8221; and &#8220;Latin American neoconstitutionalism&#8221; this article intends to carry out a reflection on the advances, limitations and possibilities of the Bolivian state toward a plurinational state since it was implemented in 2009. Therefore, important concepts such as indigenous identity, multiple nationalities, legal pluralism and autonomy have become part of this new political decolonization process in Bolivia. They are both analyzed and questioned here: what is the implementation of a plurinational state in Bolivia? What are the limits of the concept of indigenous native peoples and peasants? How the process of chiquitana organization and their demands as indigenous are being configured by the state? For this approach the folowing authors will be used as theoretical frame: Linera, Mollinedo, Zavaleta, Schavezon, Puhl, Riester, among others. The research is a qualitative approach based on bibliographic references, institutional documents and interviews.

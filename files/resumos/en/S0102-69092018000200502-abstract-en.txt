This paper aims to analyze Marcuse&#8217;s reading of Max Weber&#8217;s sociology, focusing on his remarks about the changes in the political sphere by the end of capitalism&#8217;s liberal phase. From an immanent critique of Weberian thought, Marcuse correlates the overlap between the form of rational-bureaucratic domination and charismatic type of leadership to the objective bases ofadvanced industrial societies. More than just comment on a classic of sociology, it is possible to reconstruct aspects of his social theory through these criticisms of Weber&#8217;s thought. In addition, if the same instrumental rationality colonizes various fields of social life, the marcusean diagnosis moves away from a one-dimensional understanding of late modernity, emphasizing the role of its contradictions and antagonisms.

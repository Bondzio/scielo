An important change on the rural world currently takes place : the rural sphere is no longer seen just as private space, but as public. In the foundations of such transition, one can find the very change in the relationship between society and nature. The core of this paper is the analysis of such transformations and their effects over rural development policies. For that, the rural area of the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba, State of Paran√°, Brazil, will be locus of the discussions presented in this paper.

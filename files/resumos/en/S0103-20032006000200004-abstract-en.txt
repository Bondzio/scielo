This study presents a comparative evaluation among farmers vs. small, medium and large enterprises perceptions of the Senador Nilo Coelho and Maria Teresa Irrigated Perimeters in the SÃ£o Francisco Valley on the adoption of water saving irrigation technologies. The evaluation is carried on by interviewing producers in a field study. All obtained information in questions related to installation and maintenance costs and productivity of the adopted technologies by producers and other available technologies were used to obtain the results presented in this study. Results show that there is some utilization among entrepreneurs of modern irrigation systems. However, adoption rates are low and the knowledge is not present among all producers. For such farmers, the utilization of inadequate irrigation systems is more frequent thus engendering in productive inefficiency among farmers.

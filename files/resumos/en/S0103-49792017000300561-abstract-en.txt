Strictly speaking, there isn't a sociology of immigration in the works of Gilberto Freyre. Nonetheless, immigration isn't a topic absent from analyses on the freyrian model of amalgam and on social and racial miscegenation. It is present also in lectures and books on the luso-tropical civilization, and in his interest and travels through other cultures and countries. It can also be observed in his parliamentary acting in defense of lusophony during the Assembleia Constituinte [Constituent Assembly] of 1946. This paper discusses Freyre's contribution to the sociology of immigration in Brazil, with regards to a more general discussion on luso-tropicalism. Putting into a comparative perspective the definitions of luso-tropicalism and analyses of assimilation processes, the paper concludes that the studies in which Freyre analyses aspects of immigration were a decisive counterpart to the development of his ideas on the luso-tropical civilization, in addition to being important contributions to the sociology of immigration in Brazil.

This article relates a research made with innovator teachers of the University of SÃ£o Paulo, which aim was to search elements to rethink the educational formation provided to university teachers. A group of these teachers was interviewed, in order to obtain details about the nature of their innovations, to explain the reasons why they introduced changes in their teaching, to explicit the relationship between their teaching and research activities and to define the function that they had attributed to teaching at the university. They were also asked to inform the way which their academic trajectory had been carried out until then. The diversity of the collected experiences and, at the same time, the convergence of ideas about the functions of teaching and research led us to affirm that, more than a specific teaching education, it would be a great improvement to teacher education, to become aware of teaching difficulties, accompanied by institutional valorization of this activity

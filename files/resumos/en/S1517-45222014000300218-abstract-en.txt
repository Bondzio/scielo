We present an exploratory study that investigated biographical stories of Brazilians                who choose to continue their education or develop research in Portugal. We sought to                find in their experiences explanatory links connecting the motivations and processes                that bring them to Portugal, as well as the expectations and projects that they hold                for the future, which may include, or not, this country. We take into account,                particularly, the way this narrative carries senses of identity arising from the                forms of intercultural and political relationship between Portugal and Brazil, as                well as implicit forms of cooperation and representations about the places chosen for                the development of scientific and academic careers. Our research draws on information                collected through a survey based on questionnaires and interviews with Brazilian                students and scholarship holders in Portugal.

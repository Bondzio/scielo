This article deals with the role of disciplinary and intellectual traditions in the constitution of Brazilian Political Sciences. It aims to identify the traditions that influenced the perceptions of intellectual groups, sociologists and political scientists responsible for the principles that structured the discipline&#8217;s current production. From interviews and literature review, we identified traditions and their oppositions. We understand that the adherence and the incorporation of one or another tradition by one of the groups involved depended on their academic trajectories, marked by oppositions oriented in the sense of defining the discipline i.e. defining the legitimate objective of the field and the approaches considered more appropriate to study it. The production depended on three groups and perceptions: (I) humanistic, associated with intellectuals that studied political themes before the institutionalization of the Political Sciences; (ii) academic-societal, associated with the &#8220;SÃ£o Paulo&#8217;s sociological school&#8221;; and (iii) scientific-politico-logical, associated with the group constituted around the UFMG (Federal University of Minas Gerais) and the Iuperj (University Research Institute of Rio de Janeiro), responsible for the institutionalization of the Political Sciences in Brazil.

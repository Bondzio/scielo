The objective of this study is to estimate the levels of technical efficiency of the small pineapple farmers of Santander, Colombia, using the stochastic frontier approach. In addition, this study attempts to determine whether the acreage and some of the socio-economic characteristics of farmers can influence the efficiency of their pineapple farms. By exploiting the information that was gathered in a survey of 194 pineapple farmers in the region, these farmers' technical efficiency was estimated using a Cobb-Douglas-type stochastic frontier model and a technical inefficiency model. The results suggest that acreage and the variables that are associated with the human capital, e.g., the level of schooling and the years of experience in agricultural activity, explain the levels of technical efficiency to a significant degree.

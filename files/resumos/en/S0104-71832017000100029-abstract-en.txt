Abstract Contemporary processes as a significant growth in the field of sexual medicine and aesthetic medicine require new empirical research and also the development of certain theoretical debates. In the context of recent decades, ascending forms of subjectivation have been focused on personal investment through bodily transformations, in which the consumption of &#8220;innovative&#8221; biomedical devices becomes crucial. Due to issues arising in this field, this article critically discusses some conceptual vectors. Analytical categories such as biomedicalization, pharmaceuticalization, and modes of subjectivation and improvement are central for the understanding of the processes involved. In the same direction, we need to consider the importance of questioning the boundaries between the investments associated with the maintenance of health and those motivated by improving themselves.

The judicialization of politics    is the result of a shift in core issues regarding democratic legitimacy, both    in the sphere of institution building as well as political culture. Social justice    arose as a central variable in the legitimacy of democracies, becoming vital    in establishing support towards democratic political systems. This article explores    the relation between perceptions on justice, judicialization of politics and    how the agency of judicial institutions impacts dissatisfaction with democracy.    Based on a survey carried out in the metropolitan regions of Belo Horizonte,    Goi&acirc;nia, Porto Alegre and Recife, it is argued that the discontent towards    political institutions in Brazil does not justify the ongoing judicialization    process since the perceptions on inequalities place the Judiciary within the    citizens' critical stance towards institutions. Just like other representative    institutions, the Judiciary has not been able to mitigate the perceptions on    inequalities and the ineffectiveness of the empire of law, being therefore unable    to provide a satisfactory performance in regards to the normative ends of contemporary    notions of democratic legitimacy and citizenship.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords:</b>    Perception of justice; distrust; judicialization; democracy</font></p> <hr noshade size="1"/>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two phenomena converge    in Western democracies. On the one hand, Western democracies have lived with    a permanence of distrust towards political institutions, leading to transformation    processes in democratic legitimacy. On the other hand, Western democracies have    provided institutional changes derived from a displacement of democratic legitimacy,    many times supposedly nurtured by distrust in political institutions. The convergence    of these two phenomena entails transformations in political representation,    and in particular, it allows for the strengthening of counter-majoritarian institutions.    These institutions are legitimized to the extent that its justification is set    upon the argument that representational legitimacy does not depend exclusively    on the electoral process. Consolidated democracies have undergone through transformations    in political representation, which are driven by critical citizens and new forms    of political participation by civil society, be these conventional or non-conventional    forms (Norris, 2011).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The presence of    critical citizens creates an ambivalent process in contemporary democracies.    On the one hand, citizens endorse the normative values of democratic institutions    and thus express satisfaction with the regime, and yet, distrust political institutions    due to the freedom of information and the available cognitive conditions for    regime evaluation. In turn, the presence of these critical citizens infers new    ways of participation by means of social movements and new demands, especially    in terms of social justice (Norris, 2011). In this sense, the democratic deficit    occurs when "in many countries today, satisfaction with the performance of democracy    diverges from public aspirations" (Norris, 2011: 4).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian democratic    regime, due to its transition process and institutional construction by means    of the 1988 Constitution, strengthened these two processes within the State's    normative organization and within the scope of political culture. Brazilian    democratization occasioned in an interaction between political culture and institutional    changes that have changed the panorama for democracy. That is, as in many consolidated    democracies, as soon as Brazil attained its democratic transition it began to    live with a normative and institutional convergence within its public sphere.    And indeed, several empirical researches have revealed the aggravation of distrust    in institutions in Brazil as well as the strengthening of judicial institutions    (Mois&eacute;s and Carneiro, 2008; Werneck Vianna et al., 2007). The dissatisfaction    with the performance of institutions, conveyed by the presence of distrust,    stems from a combination of aspirations for unaccomplished justice. The underperformance    of political institutions and the presence of distrust led to the strengthening    of counter-majoritarian institutions, particularly in the case of the Judiciary.    The judgment of the "<i>mensal&atilde;o</i>" case carried out by the Federal    Supreme Court (STF), the judgment of direct actions of unconstitutionality (ADI's)    and changes in the electoral and party system by the Superior Electoral Court    (TSE) positioned the Judiciary in the center of a public opinion debate.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The growing judicialization    of politics in Brazil stems from a series of institutional changes. This judicialization    process holds a component of interaction between political culture and institutional    change in which the Brazilian society sees the judiciary system as a space for    the achievement of justice and citizenship. In this sense, a field of investigation    opens up, relating perceptions on justice with the workings of institutions    and democratic political culture.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main goal of    this article is to investigate the impact of the perceptions on justice with    the dissatisfaction towards the democratic regime in Brazil and its relation    with the theme of distrust in institutions. We argue that the discontent towards    political institutions does not justify the ongoing judicialization process    in Brazil since the perception regarding inequalities - of a substantial and    procedural nature - places the Judiciary within the citizens' criticism towards    institutions. Much like other representative institutions, the Judiciary has    not been able to mitigate the perceptions on inequalities and the ineffectiveness    of the rule of law, being therefore unable to have a satisfactory performance    in regards to the normative ends of political institutions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the first section    we deal with the issue of distrust in contemporary democracies and the arguments    regarding its relation to the process of corrosion of democratic values. In    the second section we deal with the relation between distrust and the empowerment    of judicial institutions, observing the convergence among both of them as well    as the consequent analytical possibilities. The third section deals with the    Brazilian case, focusing on institutional changes within the Judiciary Power    triggered by the promulgation of the 1988 Constitution. Finally, in the fourth    section we present the research methodology and empirical findings from a survey    on justice and the Judiciary in Brazil, carried out in the metropolitan regions    of Belo Horizonte, Goi&acirc;nia, Porto Alegre and Recife.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Trust in Institutions    and Democracy Displacements</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally speaking,    Western democracies have been faced with an enigma: how to explain the growing    dissatisfaction of citizens and their distrust towards democratic institutions    and, at the same time, the support that these same citizens express towards    the normative values of democracy? The issue of distrust and discontent towards    political institutions has been shown to be a contemporary problem for democracy,    taking into account a context of systemic changes and the emergence of new modes    for mobilization and social participation. Ever since the work of Robert Putnam    the theme has gained theoretical and analytical strength among democracy scholars.    The author pointed out that distrust would be an element that places the legitimacy    of democracy at risk as well as an expression of an authoritarian vestige (Putnam,    1993).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Luhmann observes    that trust is a structuring element for social action. Insofar as modernity    established a systemic and differentiated organization, centered on functions    and objectives, superimposed on the traditional aspects of collective life,    trust presents itself as a structuring element in accordance with the management    of social expectations as carried out by highly differentiated institutions,    no longer legitimized by traditional communitarian values, but instead, by a    procedural conception. Social systems are legitimized by means of procedural    rules and the social belief derived from these rules. Trust, in this sense,    does not only involve individuals and their relations, but also society's systemic    apparatus, grounded on abstract and functional institutions. Trust is an evaluative    measure for public opinion concerning the institutions' fulfillment of their    fundamental procedures, which in turn legitimize them and ensure their authority.    According to Luhmann trust represents a belief regarding the working of institutions    and their capacity to coordinate social expectations. Trust, in this sense,    is fundamental to solidify a background belief able to maintain the workings    of social systems (Luhmann, 1996).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This perspective    of trust aims to mobilize the institutions' ethic and normative resources, especially    for political institutions. Contrary to a perspective based on an idea that    trust is centered on inter-personal relationships in which its inexistence calls    sociability itself into question, the perspective of trust in institutions is    based on the evaluation and judgment as carried out by public opinion. For Hardin,    the inexistence of trust in institutions derives from the limited information    available to individuals regarding politics. Distrust is a symptom of information    asymmetry and the sparse cognitive resources available to public opinion (Hardin,    1999). On the other hand, Claus Offe argues that distrust results from the incoherence    of institutions relative to their normative resources (Offe, 1999). Trust in    institutions presumes that society is aware of their basic norms and their permanent    functions in view of the normative values and purposes that surround them. To    this sense, values such as probity, impartiality, virtues, and rights, organize    institutions' normative ends and generate, at the level of society, normative    expectations. Trust occurs when the citizens' experience with institutions is    coherent with their expectations concerning the values and norms that surround    them (Filgueiras, 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The empirical research    on trust has shown that consolidated democracies undergo common processes which    combine distrust in institutions and adherence to democracy. For Inglehart and    Welzel (2005), distrust towards democratic institutions creates hardships towards    the legitimation of democracy. However, a large portion of the specialized literature    considers that distrust is an expression of the citizens' critical attitude    against the workings of the political system. In consolidated democracies, increasing    cognitive qualification leads to better informed social segments, which in turn    are more critical to the workings of the political system (Klingemann and Fuchs,    1995; Norris, 1999; Pharr and Putnam, 2000). On the other hand, for democracies    still in consolidation, such as the case of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America,    such distrust jeopardizes the government's capacity to coordinate society and    to establish social cooperation (Newton, 1999). Furthermore, distrust towards    political institutions does not allow for the consolidation of a democratic    political culture grounded on these institutions' ability in building their    normative justification (Dalton, 1999; Levi, 1998).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regardless of the    perspective by which one deals with the theme of distrust, the fact remains    that it has promoted changes in practices within democracies. This collective    malaise towards political institutions has led to an increasingly stronger presence    of institutions grounded on indirect representation, particularly by the establishment    of surveillance and vigilance institutions, and new actors who do not derive    their authority from popular will, but from their capacity to modify the exercise    of political power and to establish control over it (Rosanvallon, 2006). A political    discourse fed by issues such as social injustice and corruption fortifies institutions    grounded on surveillance, denouncements, and investigation, of which its legitimacy    derives from presenting themselves as representatives of the public interest    and not from electoral processes. Institutions such as the Public Prosecutor,    the Judiciary, auditing or administrative control institutions, and the media,    present themselves as new actors in the democratic political scene, and their    legitimacy derives from their distance from representative institutions and    interest groups. Transparency then comes to be an ethical resource - be it by    the actions of these institutions or by the presence of an informational society    - derived from the malfunctioning of democratic institutions (Filgueiras, 2011).    According to Rosanvallon (2006), such process corrodes the institutionalization    of political parties, electoral systems, governments and parliaments, and strengthens    institutions that do not derive their legitimacy from popular sovereignty, but    instead, from their capacity to establish surveillance and to distance themselves    from politics itself.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a result, counter-democratic    institutions arise in order to correct representational flaws and the performance    of representative democracy. Distrust nourishes processes such as judicialization    of politics and the presence of bureaucratic institutions within the representational    process (Rosanvallon, 2006). Distrust, therefore, promotes the displacement    of legitimacy, which, once based on the exercise of voting rights, is now founded    on impartiality and detachment from interests. The judiciary in particular has    taken on this central role both in consolidated democracies and in those undergoing    the consolidation process.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Judiciary, Perceptions    on Justice and (dis)trust in Institutions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The emergence of    counter-democracy, as Rosanvallon pointed out, removed from the Judiciary Power    its <i>bouche de la loi</i> characteristic, as constructed in the Liberal State,    and transformed it into an institution with political contours, especially in    the constitutional courts. In contemporary democracies, the Judiciary is configured    as an institution of power and its legitimacy derives from the competence of    its actors to resolve social conflicts. This competence is founded on the intellectual    and moral reputation derived from a supposedly impartial decision making process    (Rosanvallon, 2006: 262).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 1990s,    the concept of judicialization of politics has been employed to describe processes    by which the Judiciary Power has intervened in public policies implemented by    democratic governments as well as in the legislative process. Therefore, courts    - especially the Constitutional Courts - came to be seen as institutions that    are essentially political, in large part due to the profound effects their decisions    may exert on public policies, majoritarian preferences, and social values. Tate    and Vallinder (1997) deal with the causes behind the expansion of the Judiciary    Power and conceptualize judicialization of politics as a twofold process which    involves: (1) broadening of decision power in the judicial system to create    and execute laws and (2) the adoption, by other powers, of procedures typical    of the judicial logic such as the Parliamentary Inquiry Commission (CPIs) by    the Legislative, and administrative courts or judges by the Executive (Tate,    1997).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Neal    Tate (1997), the judicialization of politics results from the process of political    development, especially the consolidation of democracy. Therefore, democracy    becomes a condition for judicialization insofar as the Judiciary Power, in order    to intervene in public policies, depends on the existence of accountability    institutions and control of the power of the majority regarding fundamental    rights. Likewise, the separation of powers is also a condition for judicialization    since functional autonomy is essential to the Judiciary. Third, the judicialization    of politics stems from a politics of rights in which minorities can appeal to    the due legal process to protect themselves from the majorities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Associated to these    three factors, Tate lists five more factors that derive from the use of the    Judiciary in accordance to specific interests. Firstly, the judicialization    of politics stems from the use of the courts by interest groups. Human rights    defense groups, social movements, and corporative groups seek the courts in    order to consolidate their interests in function of procedural and normative    reasons expressed by Law. Second, judicialization stems from the use of courts    by oppositions, aiming for the possibility of controlling governments. Third,    judicialization stems from the ineffectiveness of majoritarian institutions    in the exercise of government and legislative process. The weakening of these    majoritarian institutions strengthens power delegation to the Judiciary. Fourth,    judicialization stems from the public opinion's perception of the construction    of public policies. A solidified perception of corruption or the distance from    majoritarian citizens' interests begets a position in which the Judiciary is    presented as a normative and moral resource grounded on legality and legitimacy.    Finally, and less common according to Tate, judicialization stems from a delegation    process by the very majoritarian institutions, which find themselves unable    to govern or to legislate (Tate, 1997: 28-33).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democracy consolidation    leads to a process by which the Judiciary Power ascends in the public sphere    by means of institutional changes that carry with them the centrality of the    rule of law (Carvalho, 2007). On the other hand, it's important to observe that    these institutional changes lead to transformations for the public opinion and    in the composition of political culture.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By means of this    process, counter-democracy institutions are drawn near to political representation.    For John Hart Ely (1980), the presence of the Judiciary Power as an institution    of representation is part of the very notion of democracy. As an institution    whose legitimacy does not stem from majoritarian processes, but from a procedural    conception of law, the Judiciary - especially the Constitutional Courts - emerges    as a corrective for political representation. Hence, according to Ely, the presence    of the Judiciary in the political process is not contradictory to the values    of representational democracy. On the contrary, judicial control fosters social    change and guarantees that the principle of equality is established.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The presence of    the Judiciary allows for minorities to be represented against the abuses of    the majority and ensures that representation does not promote distortions that    could detriment fundamental rights. For Ely, distrust is not about the result    of public policies implemented by governments, but a function of the procedures    adopted for the decision-making process that occurs in the spheres of the Executive    and Legislative Powers. In this sense, distrust depends on the observation of    inequalities in the application of norms and rules (Ely, 1980). Hence, Ely's    notion of distrust evokes that the empowerment of the Judicial Power in democracies    depends on a negative perception of procedural equality as practiced by majoritarian    representative institutions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, such    perspectives on judicialization do not conceive it as external to the changes    in values and attitudes in democracies. Instead, this is a process that has    its origins in the very strengthening of democracy (Rosanvallon, 2006), which    in turn is associated to democratic political culture itself, along with new    instruments for social mobilization, the internet and improvements in transparency    instruments.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, this literature    does not take into account the particularities in young democracies in which    the citizens' critical stand still coexists with ambivalent positions towards    the normative values of democracy. Likewise, one cannot attribute judicialization    in young democracies to a consolidated democratic trajectory insofar as a widespread    perception of inequality remains, especially regarding the fundamental procedures    of political and juridical decision. And lastly, it should be said that this    process does not happen uniformly in all democracies, inasmuch as in young democracies    it stems from institutional changes that derive from transition processes. The    next section aims to analyze the Brazilian case.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Transformation    of the Brazilian Judiciary and its Position in the Public Opinion</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When analyzing    the Brazilian case, Werneck Vianna et al. (2007) calls attention to the fact    that judges and courts have, since the 1970s, increasingly occupied roles that    were traditionally reserved to political institutions. This occurs due to profound    transformations whose origins date back to the second post-war period, especially    with the introduction of a "dogmatic nucleus" to express fundamental values    so as to compel the sovereign power in constitutional articles. This increasing    regulation through Law would result in an open, unspecified and programmatic    legislation, making juridical interpretation a fundamental point in democratic    life (Werneck Vianna et al., 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just as in the    preambles and declarations of fundamental rights of many post-war constitutions,    normative principles of absolute legitimacy were also imposed to those that    followed authoritarian regimes - such as in Brazil - as a mandatory source of    limitation of the State and for all positive law. Therefore, the experience    of democratic constitutionalism was generalized in Brazil as public law would    then internalize a conception of social justice. The incorporation of justice    ideals by modern constitutionalism served a symbolic role, producing information    for the political system and legitimizing - by elucidating the fundamentals    of juridical order - values, expectations, and behavior. That is to say, social    justice would express the normative resources of political institutions and    would ensure a process of citizenship promotion that refers to a prospection    of positive liberty and equality as expressed in the 1988 Magna Carta. The constitutional    acknowledgment of the demand for the implementation of foundational and social    rights, originating from its prospective nature, legitimized the de-neutralization    of the Judicial Power's function in Brazil, whose job is to examine whether    the exercise of the power to legislate leads to the concretization of expected    results as expressed in constitutional norms (Ferraz, 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, the    1988 Constitution displaced a juridical culture characterized by a kind of positivism    with a privatizing disposition. This shift in juridical culture gave rise to    an expansion in the conception of fundamental rights, understood as an assertion    of principles. These principles, as expressed in article 5 of the 1988 Constitution,    establish action programs and specify objectives to implicate the State's duty    to action. The effectuation of fundamental rights is authored by a circle of    interpreters within the judicial sphere. These interpreters put such rights    into effect by means of an extensive hermeneutic process in which the aim is    to give "density and embodiment to abstractly configured principles within the    Constitution" (Cittadino, 2000: 39). The Judiciary in Brazil, conceived as this    new public space, widened the exercise of a "complex sovereignty" where it combines    political with functional representation. This combination occurs from two dimensions    in the defense of citizenship: political - carried out by the elected representatives    based on democratic procedures - and functional - carried out by the community    of Law interpreters, made up of judicial agents legitimized by the Constitution    (Werneck Viana et al., 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this sense,    the Judiciary assumed the role of a vigilant for political institutions, considering    that it provides the concreteness of social justice in public policies and the    regularity of procedures and democratic values. Institutions in the judicial    system present themselves as representatives of social interest and act in accordance    to a growing criticism and dissatisfaction with democracy. Once majoritarian    institutions show themselves to be unable to accomplish justice, thus nourishing    the citizens' critical stand and distrust in institutions, institutional changes    in the judicial system interact with the background political culture, reinforcing    the judicialization of politics. Changes within the judicial system and the    support towards the Judiciary's political agency arise in Brazil at the same    time as distrust towards the political system's majoritarian institutions expands.    In the Brazilian case, distrust towards institutions is due to a poor functioning    of the political system regarding the society's interests, the constant presence    of corruption by means of political scandals and the perception of their ineffectiveness    when dealing with rights (Mois&eacute;s and Carneiro, 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consequently, judicialization    should not be understood merely as a process of institutional innovation derived    from the centrality of rights, but as a process of decentering of democratic    legitimacy, as Rosanvallon (2006) points out. In Brazil, the citizens' discontent    with representative and electoral institutions would entail the displacement    of democratic legitimacy towards the Judiciary. Therefore, judicialization cannot    be understood solely by the actions of the judiciary, but also by an incisive    agency by counter-majoritarian institutions such as the Public Ministry, who    presents itself as an interpreter of Law and controller of the State's actions.    In Brazil, following in the trails of Rosanvallon (2006), due to the presence    of distrust towards political institutions and the presence of judicial system    institutions in the public scene, a counter-democracy process emerged. Therefore,    the changes within the Judiciary would not merely consist of a set of institutional    innovations, but also of a displacement of the center of democratic political    legitimacy, going from electoral representation towards juridical activism -    the actions of the Judiciary, Public Minister and mobilization by part of the    Constitution interpreters' community. This process constitutes in an interaction    between institutional changes and political culture that modifies the scene    for democratic institutions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the specialized    literatures highlights how judicialization occurs in consolidated democracies,    this process holds certain particularities in countries ongoing a democratic    consolidation process, especially when dealing with the perceptions on justice.    In the case of Brazil the judicialization of politics, alongside the presence    of distrust, does not imply in a perception by society of impartiality and equalitarian    treatment in judicial procedures. As we see it, the Brazilian Judiciary was    not empowered by means of a generalized distrust towards representative institutions.    Just as it occurs with the representative institutions, the Brazilian Judiciary    is immersed in the distrust syndrome insofar as in the light of public opinion    it cannot ensure an equalitarian application of procedures and democratic values.    Additionally, the perception of durable inequalities in Brazil does not allow    for us to affirm that judicialization should be understood as a delegation of    powers to the Judiciary, in the sense of an emergence of counter-democracy,    according to Rosanvallon's argument (2006).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the case of    young democracies, such as Brazil, the perception of procedural inequality places    the Judicial Power within the distrust syndrome, in spite of the endorsement    of the normative values of democracy. The Brazilian Judiciary, by hypothesis,    does not contribute to the correction of the vices in political representation,    as Ely (1980) would affirm, but in fact it strengthens the dissatisfaction with    democracy, considering it's part of the distrust syndrome. In order to test    this hypothesis, the next section deals with data obtained by a survey in the    metropolitan regions of Belo Horizonte, Goi&acirc;nia, Recife and Porto Alegre.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Methodology    and Data Analysis</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A public opinion    survey was carried out in the metropolitan regions of Belo Horizonte, Goi&acirc;nia,    Porto Alegre and Recife from a sample made up of 300 household interviews for    each of the metropolitan regions, for a total of 1201 interviews. The sample    was weighed - in its totality - by quotas concerning income range, gender, education    level, age range and whether the respondent was part of the economically active    population according to the 2010 Census<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective was    to assess the impact of the Judiciary's agency in the satisfaction with democracy.    The questions regarding the Judicial Power aimed to examine how respondents    saw their role in the Brazilian political system as well as to examine fundamental    issues related to procedures and institutional rules and, ultimately, its effects    on democracy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Firstly, the respondent    was asked about his satisfaction with democracy in Brazil. Results show that    dissatisfaction with democracy prevails for more than half of the sample, expressing    therefore a critical context towards the regime. In the sample, 1.9% of the    respondents claim to be very satisfied, 38.2% claim to be satisfied, 51.3% claim    to be dissatisfied and, lastly, 8.6% claim to be very dissatisfied. Similar    results were found in the 2010 Latin Barometer for Brazil. For the Latin Barometer    research, 3.4% demonstrated to be very satisfied, 48.7% were satisfied, 33.6%    were dissatisfied and 14.3% were very dissatisfied. Such results points to a    relative dissatisfaction with democracy in Brazil, and so they reveal the emergence    of citizens' criticism, conducted by the belief that democracy displays problems    that could affect its legitimacy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the intent    of verifying if dissatisfaction with democracy contrasts with adhesion to democratic    values, a normative question was asked aiming to understand the concordance    of individuals towards democracy, when compared to authoritarian governments.    Results show that adherence to democracy is a majoritarian option in the sample,    converging with other researches, including the Latin Barometer, which shows    that regime dissatisfaction does not imply normative indifference for the individuals    when comparing democracy and authoritarianism. Within the context of the sample,    50.3% of the respondents answered "democracy is better than any other form of    government", 22.0% of the sample answered "in some occasions an authoritarian    government can be better than a democratic one" and lastly, 27.7% of the sample    answered "there is no difference between an authoritarian government and a democratic    government". That is, in spite of the high dissatisfaction level, individuals    adhere to the values of democracy. However, it is important to note that the    data presents elevated indicators of ambivalence towards democracy in that 27.7%    of the sample claim there is no difference between an authoritarian government    and a democratic government, as well as a high indicator of the presence of    an authoritarian option as expressed in the assertion that in some occasions    an authoritarian government can be better than a democratic one.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By crossing the    data presented above, one realizes that individuals who normatively endorse    democracy have a higher tendency towards satisfaction with democracy. However,    individuals who support the perspective of an authoritarian government tend    to be dissatisfied with democracy. According to the data shown in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/03t01.jpg">table    1</a>, it is possible to claim that satisfaction with democracy is associated    with the normative endorsement of the democratic regime and that dissatisfaction    with democracy is associated with the opinion of individuals who assume an ambivalent    position towards democracy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Respondents were    also asked about their trust from a list of institutions. The objective is to    observe how trust in institutions has an impact on satisfaction with democracy    and test the two theoretical positions previously shown -- whether distrust    has a negative impact on democratic legitimacy (Dalton, 1999; 2004) or if distrust    can be a sign of vigor for democracy inasmuch as citizens vindicate for changes    in the performance of institutions (Norris, 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/03t02.jpg">Table    2</a> below shows the trust and distrust frame regarding some specific institutions.    We can observe that that data on <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/03t02.jpg">table 2</a> converges    with researches conducted by Mois&eacute;s and Carneiro (2008) and Ribeiro (2011)    in which the National Congress assumes the first position of distrust when compared    to other institutions. It also reveals one data that points towards the tendency    of assigning the Federal Police as a paladin for a favorable public opinion    since its trust levels surpass 50% (Arantes, 2011).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Distrust in institutions    in Brazil is expressed to the point that, according to Mois&eacute;s and Carneiro    (2008), trust in institutions does not surpass 35%, according to surveys carried    out between 1995 and 2002. There is a generalized discontent in Brazil with    parliaments, parties, government, courts of justice, the police, and health    and education services (Ribeiro, 2011). The most important thing to notice is    that such distrust is generalized insofar as this perception crosses segments    of gender, income, education level, age and geographical distribution (Meneguello,    2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The survey also    addressed the capacity of the institutions to produce justice. Since the survey    deals with the Judiciary and its relations with political institutions, the    respondents were asked to position themselves in regards to the capacity of    institutions to produce justice, in a broad sense. This procedure was done to    compare if the distrust expressed in the table above could be related to the    capacity to produce justice. Questions were made regarding the capacity of the    Judicial Power, government, National Congress, NGOs and associations, churches,    and schools and universities to produce justice. The question did not specify    what type of justice, merely its relation with the listed institutions. The    data in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/03t03.jpg">table 3</a> below shows that institutions    of a State character, the Judiciary, the government and National Congress have,    in the opinions of the individuals, promoted less justice than institutions    of a non-State character, that is, NGOs, churches, and schools and universities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question regarding    the capacity of institutions to promote justice does not allow for a clear crossing    in relation to trust or distrust towards institutions. But it is possible to    discern that both questions may be correlated insofar as they touch on central    themes for the building of trust. We could very likely affirm that institutions    incapable of producing justice are subjected to a larger distrust insofar that    justice is a fundamental social aspiration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The agency of the    Judiciary must take into consideration the respect for equality, as previously    pointed out in Ely's argument (1980). The relationship between justice and democracy    should be measured by the capacity of judicial institutions to ensure internal    procedures by which it is possible to establish, in an effective manner, procedural    equality for citizens in regards to justice (Dworkin, 2001). As for the perceptions    of individuals regarding equal treatment under the law, the most common answer    was "no" for 61.4% of the respondents, followed by the answer "sometimes" for    21.8% of the sample and finally, the answer "yes" for 16.9% of the sample.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, we must    take into account that the Judiciary is not the only institution responsible    for procedural equality within a democracy. For research purposes we confronted    this data with a specific question regarding the Judiciary Power, interrogating    whether it makes its decisions with no outside influence from politicians, businesspeople    and other interest types. The most common answer in the sample, for 48.3% of    the respondents, was "no", followed by the answer "yes" for 26.7% for the respondents,    and the answer "sometimes" for 25.0% of the respondents.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This measurement    of the Judiciary's impartiality means that its agency impacts citizens' perceptions    on procedural equality. That is, once its agency is not oblivious to the interests    of politicians, businesspeople or other interests, this perception impacts procedural    equality as a fundamental republican value. The Brazilian Judiciary does not    guarantee, in the opinion of the respondents, procedural equality, and therefore    it is not recognized as an institution in which impartiality ensures its legitimacy    under the Rule of Law. The crossing of data presented above allows us to verify    a strong association among the two variables, according to <a href="#t4">table    4</a> below:</font></p>     <p align="center"><a name="t4"></a></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/03t04.jpg"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a hypothesis,    insofar as the Judiciary is not seen as ensuring procedural equality in its    decision-making process - as indicated in the data sample - we can speculate    that such perception is influenced by a relative deprivation of basic public    goods. That is, the feeling of dissatisfaction towards the offer of public goods    and the perception of one's own life may have an impact on the satisfaction    with democracy and contaminate the perception of the Judiciary itself. To this    end, the research employed a relative deprivation indicator based on questions    regarding peoples' satisfaction with basic issues that impact their personal    life (Vala and Marinho, 2003), asking questions about subjective evaluation    of distributive justice, especially those related to the personal conditions    on safety, health, education and housing, and a question on personal life satisfaction.    The data in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/03t05.jpg">table 5</a> below reveals higher dissatisfaction    rates regarding safety and health than regarding education and housing. In spite    of the dissatisfaction with the offer of basic public goods, the respondents    reveal a high satisfaction rate with their personal life.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We speculated if    the dissatisfaction with democracy could be related to the performance of the    judicial institutions. A measure was established asking the respondents if the    performance of institutions in the judicial system was excellent, good, average,    bad or awful. According to data on <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/03t06.jpg">table 6</a>, the    highest criticism revolves around access to the Judiciary Power and the performance    of the Public Defender.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lastly, we questioned    the respondents on their knowledge of the articles in the 1988 Federal Constitution.    The large majority of respondents said they did not know the Magna Carta: 78.6%    of the respondents revealed they did not know the articles in the 1988 Federal    Constitutions, followed by those respondents who claimed to know a few, represented    by 12.2% of the sample and, lastly, 9.2% of the respondents who claimed knowledge    of the Constitution's articles. This variable offers a cognitive measurement    regarding Law and fundamental rights.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Taking this set    of data into consideration, we seek to establish their dimensionality by means    of a factor analysis through the extraction of main components. The factor analysis    allows us to comprehend the data interaction and how they aggregate and correlate    with hypothetical factors. The objective of this technique is to establish the    dimension of the data, identifying the latent factors that represent the interactions    within the set of variables. We sought to define the factors associated with    the respondents' answers regarding the Judiciary and trust in institutions.    Before we proceed to the factor analysis we tested data reliability in order    to investigate if they discriminate the set of informers by means of a Cronbach's    alpha index. By aggregating the variables that will be exposed in the factor    model we reached a 0.859 index, which allows us to validate the factor model    composition. The factor model served to verify the aggregation effect in variables    related to different forms of perceiving the performance of the judicial system    regarding the themes of trust and procedural equality. By gathering the data    presented above, <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/03t07.jpg">table 7</a> below presents the matrix    for main component and factor loads.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can observe    in the factor matrix that the data aggregation allows us to affirm that there    are seven dimensions or latent factors present in the analysis. The commonalities    were tested and signified, reaching the value of 1. The matrix above results    from a Varimax rotation process with Kaiser Normalization, presenting a KMO    validity measure of 0.851. The first factor aggregated data concerning trust    in institutions. It is then possible to understand trust in institutions as    a latent factor. It's interesting to observe that the perception of the National    Congress diverged from the perception of other institutions, being strongly    associated with the capacity to produce justice in the context of state institutions.    The second factor stipulated by the model aggregates the capacity to produce    justice by the Judicial Power, government, and National Congress as a latent    dimension to be considered. It contrasts with the third factor, which differentiated    the capacity to produce justice by NGOs, church, and schools and universities,    as a distinct factor. Therefore, the second factor was considered as the capacity    by state institutions to promote justice and the third factor as the capacity    of non-state institutions to promote justice. The fourth latent factor in the    model aggregated the respondents' perception regarding relative deprivation.    The data of the variables associated to this factor present the same direction    and sense. The fifth latent factor would be the perception of procedural equality    as practiced by the Judiciary. As shown in <a href="#t4">table 4</a> above,    the variables that take into account the perception of inequality in the application    of laws, and the perception of the influence from politicians, businesspeople    and other interests in the Judiciary have the same direction, representing a    distinct factor for the analysis. The sixth factor isolated the variable concerning    the respondents' knowledge on articles in the 1988 Constitution. This factor    only presented this variable as an isolated element in the analysis. Lastly,    the seventh factor aggregated variables concerning the respondents' perception    on the performance of institutions and agents in the judicial system.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The factor analysis    technique allows us to comprehend the interaction between variables and search    for unobserved&nbsp;latent variables by means of the aggregation in the set    of variables. Based on this factor model, we built a logistic regression model    in order to understand how each one of these factors impact dissatisfaction    with democracy. Firstly, we transform the variable on dissatisfaction with democracy    in a binary variable, aggregating the categories "very satisfied" and "satisfied"    in a single "satisfied" category. The categories "dissatisfied" and "very dissatisfied"    were aggregated with the "dissatisfied" category. This logistic regression procedure    allows us to comprehend the impact of factors derived from the factor analysis    on dissatisfaction with democracy. <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/03t08.jpg">Table 8</a> below    presents the results for the conducted logistic regression and the impacts of    the factors on dissatisfaction with democracy. That is, the model allows us    to identify the impact of each one of these seven factors in the chance of respondents    having answered that they are dissatisfied with democracy. The proposed logistic    model was controlled by the variables: gender, whether the respondent belongs    to the economically active population, low or high educational level, and income    lower than or superior to R$1,635 (3 minimum wages). The model was run from    the scores established in the above factor analysis.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By observing the    table above, we see that some factors cannot be analyzed since they do not present    a significance index lower than 5%. This is the case of the variables: gender,    economically active population, education, income lower than R$1,635, capacity    to produce justice by non-State institutions, knowledge of the 1988 Constitution,    and evaluation of the performance of judicial institutions. We therefore disregarded    these variables.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for the factor    trust in institutions, distrust causes a 36% increase in the chance of dissatisfaction    with democracy in Brazil, being therefore a significant indicator. The impact    of the factor ability to promote justice by State institutions causes a 60%    increase in the chance of dissatisfaction with democracy. That is, the citizens'    criticism concerning the State institutions' capacity to produce justice increases    by 60% the chance of the respondents in the sample to answer that they are dissatisfied    with democracy. On the other hand, the factor capacity to promote justice by    non-State institutions does not impact dissatisfaction with democracy and is    also not significant to the analysis. The perception of relative deprivation    significantly impacts dissatisfaction with democracy, increasing the response    to this item by 87%. The perception of procedural inequality performed by the    Judiciary significantly impacts dissatisfaction with democracy, increasing in    29% the chance of response to this item.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We conclude from    the analyses that the factors with a higher impact on dissatisfaction with democracy    are, respectively, the perception of relative deprivation, perception of the    inability of State institutions to promote justice, distrust in institutions    and, lastly, perception of the procedural inequality practiced by the Judiciary    Power. Hence, we can observe that dissatisfaction with the democratic regime    in Brazil is firstly motivated by a negative perception towards certain social    justice indicators, and only then is it a problem of distrust in institutions.    As we previously highlighted, it is not possible to directly compare the relation    between social justice and trust. Nevertheless, it is possible to know that    the perception of a lack of promotion of justice, which certainly elevates the    perception of relative deprivation, has a bigger impact on dissatisfaction with    democracy than the problem of distrust in institutions. Therefore, we can infer    that the democratic deficit is associated with the perception of social justice    in Brazil, within the context of an exclusionary society, pervaded by enormous    inequalities. Within this context, the perception of the performance of the    Judiciary is ambivalent insofar as it operates within the expectations of producing    justice at the same time that this same Judiciary continues to reproduce strong    procedural inequalities in light of its evaluation by public opinion. We therefore    deduce that justice, and social justice in particular, is a problem of highest    priority for Brazilian society and that it impacts democracy in a way that increases    the dissatisfaction towards the regime. And, at the same time, the Judiciary    is inserted in the citizens' criticism concerning the democratic deficit.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Final Considerations</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The data analysis    carried out above allows us to assert that perception of justice in Brazil holds    certain particularities when compared to consolidated democracies. Firstly,    the Brazilian Judiciary is immersed in the distrust syndrome, impeding us to    affirm, as Ely (1980) and Rosanvallon (2006) do, that distrust empowers the    Judiciary in order to intervene and to correct majoritarian political representation.    This is confirmed by the fact that the perception of the workings of justice    in Brazil does not attribute impartiality to the Judiciary in relation to political    interests. Instead, there is a negative perception concerning the unequal agency    of this institution, which in turn impacts dissatisfaction with democracy. Unlike    consolidated democracies, we can attribute this fact to the permanence of a    sentiment of relative deprivation, which persists due to the perpetuity of inequalities    and the inefficiency of the Brazilian State to carry out equalitarian and equitable    public policies. Functional representation is then immersed in the same societal    distrust towards political institutions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this sense,    the agency of the Judicial Power in Brazil can be understood as a result of    the process of institutional changes carried out by the 1988 Constitution, but    such agency should be regarded with caution when it comes to its relation to    distrust, in the sense that it would give the judiciary institutions a prerogative    to ensure minority representation and to strengthen vigilance in order to correct    the improprieties of representative democracy. The distrust of institutions    in Brazil does not empower the Judiciary, but places it within the citizenship    criticism due to the permanence of perceived inequality in its regular operation.    The negative perception of representative democracy also affects functional    representation exerted by counter-democracy institutions. Therefore, the Judiciary    is inserted within the democratic deficit criticism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Democratic consolidation    and the possible reversion of distrust in institutions in Brazil depend on a    decrease in the intensity concerning the perception of inequalities. This is    true both for the sentiment of relative deprivation towards access to fundamental    public goods as well as in procedural equality, which should be practiced by    political institutions as well as judicial institutions. Without strengthening    institutions and ensuring the prevalence of the rule of law, it becomes impossible    to establish a democratic political culture and to have citizens supporting    and trusting the normative resources employed by institutions. This interaction    between political culture and institutions demands further investigation in    the Brazilian case, with special emphasis on the evaluation of institutions'    normative resources and their role in producing justice and inequality-reduction.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Institutional changes    derived from the judicialization of politics may result in an uncontrolled Judiciary    Power in Brazil as well as in efforts to control representation as exerted in    courts and which lack a public sense buoyed by the rule of law. Judicialization    of politics may lead to new forms of authoritarianism in which the inherent    depoliticization leads to populist temptations (Rosanvallon, 2006) or a new    form of elitism disguised as a defense of democratic values, which merely maintains    inequalities intact (Hirschl, 2004). As for the Brazilian case, the judicialization    process seems to lead, due to the interaction between political culture and    institution changes, to this second tendency, considering that the Judiciary's    agency presents itself in an ambivalent position between the defense of democratic    values and an elitism that reproduces social inequalities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The propositions    of this article must be tested in comparative researches of a broader scope    as so to better understand the role of the Judiciary Power in young democracies.    For the Brazilian case at least, it's important to perceive how distrust does    not exempt the Judiciary from criticism and does not allow us to affirm that    judicialization is its direct consequence. If there is something that amplifies    the distrust in institutions and its ambivalent relationship towards satisfaction    with democracy, it's certainly the perception of inequalities and their permanence    in young democracies. If distrust results from the inability of institutions    to mobilize their normative resources, then the permanence of inequalities -    social injustice and the failure to comply with fundamental procedures to the    rule of law - corrodes its ability to establish a democratic culture. If there    is one thing that corrodes democracy, inequalities are a certain part of this    process and how they lead to corruption, inefficiency of public policies and    the ineffectiveness of the rule of law.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ARANTES, Rog&eacute;rio    B.

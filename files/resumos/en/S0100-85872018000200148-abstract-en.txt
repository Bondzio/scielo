Abstract The question of the links between religion and politics in general, and religions and the State in particular, is part of social research at the international and local level. The understanding of this phenomenon has led to propose a series of key categories, such as regulation and secularism, with characteristics in Latin America. In this paper we propose to discuss the category of secularism, its potentialities and limitations to analyse the relationship between the State and religions at the local level. For this we will present the municipal organisms which work with the religions in the Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina), their performance and the networks they build.

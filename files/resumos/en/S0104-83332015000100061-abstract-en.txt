Based on an ethnography with men that use digital media in search of same sex partners in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, this paper discusses what motivates their use of technological platforms. It also employs sociological and historical elements to reflect upon the social aspects of desire that fuel this search and the new visibility regime in which these men live. Finally, it analyses the moral, symbolic and material restrictions that mold an economy of desire demanding their discretion and secrecy.

This article features reflections on investigative methodologies with children and their cultures from the point of view of Sociology of Childhood. This theoretical field considers children as social actors that build fight strategies by means of their peer cultures. The Brazilian academic production on children and their cultures does not have yet a tradition of studies on the voices of children themselves. This issue has led to the organization of this text in three sections. In the first section we think of the absence of children in Brazilian researches and the influences of an androcentric science emerging with modernity. In the second section we present the ethnography of childhoods as a possibility of contact and acceptance of adults by groups of children in order to understand their peer cultures. In the third section we raise some ideas concerning the traits of children cultures as a theoretical basis for the construction of other manners of conducting research, which connect science and aesthetics, reason and emotion, fantasy and reality.

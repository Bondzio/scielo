Abstract The article proposes to present a discussion regarding the training path of pilots in Brazil and their competency-based training paradigm, according to a literature review. It presents as an object of analysis the multiple crew pilot licence - MPL. The MPL licence is the first one created in over forty years of the existence of International Civil Aviation Organization - ICAO. It has introduced a debate about pilot training facing the technological advances produced by the airline industry and the automation processes of aircraft. Although there is not yet enough data available to prove the efficacy of the MPL licence, preliminary results show that competency-based training can be equal or better than traditional pilot training.

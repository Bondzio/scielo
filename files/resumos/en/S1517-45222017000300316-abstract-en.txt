Abstract Based on the articulation of modes of experience in the private sphere in each spirit of capitalism, we argue that the contemporary transformations of privacy, commonly attributed to the spread of new information and communication technologies, can only be properly understood if we expand the gaze in search of socio-historical processes that define the boundaries between the public and the private. By doing this, we can see how values &#8203;&#8203;and justifications that animate the connectionist capitalism and promote an unprecedented rapprochement between private life and work, redefine the boundaries that separate intimate and private experience from the economic sphere.

The objective of this work is to contribute to the organizational facilitation on participation processes of urban planning through the projection of an ethnographical approach. The problem at hand is the one that is portrayed in the social scene of real processes as well as the one that underlying in the wings of the methodological, theorical and ideological reflection. The point in common between both levels of analysis is that the actors involved in the scenes and the analysts themselves act according to a shared component that we place here as the core and objective of our proposal: the reflixibility, in terms of a cultural otherness built and objectifying that nurtures the practices towards the transformation as a circular and effective method of organizational achievements.

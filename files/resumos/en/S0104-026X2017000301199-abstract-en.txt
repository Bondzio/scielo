Abstract: This article discusses the challenges to gender mainstreaming in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. I argue that the demand for the election of more women must be associated to the discussion of the rules and procedures governing their activities, since these can limit it or make it more effective from the perspective of women's representation. Assessing the distribution of resources defined as critical posts (seats in legislative committees a, chairmanships of committees and the speakership of the Chamber) among male and female legislators, it can be seen that this occurs unevenly. Nevertheless, the creation of the Secretariat for Women stands out as an important resource. Finally, I argue that the challenge to elect more women should be articulated eith the need to ensure that female legislators have access political resources to leverage changes in order to achieve the principle of gender mainstreaming.

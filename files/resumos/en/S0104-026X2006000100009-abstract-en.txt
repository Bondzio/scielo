This article analyzes the particular modes of governance of adolescent sexuality that emerge from the educational activities carried out by sexual and reproductive health programs for young Colombians. It also analyzes their effects on the production of adolescent subjectivities. In addition, it examines the perception of those who carry out the pedagogic activities related to sexuality with adolescents and the way these perceptions are marked by ethnic/racial differences, as well as their influence on their professional performance. Field data are based on observation of two pilot programs on sexual and reproductive health among adolescent high school students in Bogot√°, and on interviews with workshop coordinators and male and female counselors.

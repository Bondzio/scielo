This article aims to analyze the findings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Enquiry of Violence against Women created by the Brazilian National Congress in 2012 regarding the implementation of the Maria da Penha Law. After a year and a half of work, the report pointed the fragility of public policies to combat violence against women and the obstacles in the implementation of the Maria da Penha Law, among which: ) the fragile network of specialized services to women victims of violence; b) the small number of specialized courts for domestic and family violence against women; c) the failure of the decision of the Supreme Court to prohibit application of the conditional suspension of proceedings d) the resistance of jurists to understand the proposed new law and break with the family perspective; e) the insufficient budget for the development and maintenance of public policies to combat violence against women. The report concludes that the Brazilian states invest very little in specific public policy and that the full implementation of the Maria da Penha Law depends on a new legal understanding of the relationship between government and a budget policy of gender.

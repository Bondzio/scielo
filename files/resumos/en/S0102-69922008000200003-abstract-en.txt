The paper argues that in order to understand the current state of the Argentine religious field and the development of new religions it is necessary to include the social resistance they encounter into our analysis. It criticizes the widespread idea that after the erosion of Catholic monopoly a religious market is effortlessly formed and pluralism simply ensues. Drawing on recent work by James Beckford, it argues that religious diversity does not necessarily entail pluralism (its positive evaluation). Emphasizing the idea central to the religious economies paradigm (Stark, Iannaccone) that the degree of regulation of a religious market is always a crucial variable to consider, it follows Grim and Finke's multidimensional approach to regulation, taking into account governmental as well as social regulation. It exemplifies these ideas by examining the rise of an evangelical social movement - out of a prior merely religious one - that strives for equal religious rights in a situation of supposed religious pluralism in Argentina.

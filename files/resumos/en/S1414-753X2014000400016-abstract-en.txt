The present contribution argues for increasing prioritization of the social, recognition of culture, and promotion of a disaster culture that promotes social resilience in the face of hazards. The current global trend has been to make vital infrastructure more resilient. But behavior is more difficult to control and communities continue to inhabit and settle in inherently hazardous areas. This short text shows how relevant it is to understand the logics underlying people's behavior, social and cultural aspects. In fact, promoting a culture of resilience can help prevent unnecessary victims and loss. For this, culture should not be seen as a hindrance, but as a pool of resources.

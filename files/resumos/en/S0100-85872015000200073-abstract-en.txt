Abstract This article analyzes the inclusion of evangelical groups in the area of public administration in Argentina. This phenomenon is explained by the welfare work done by these actors at the territorial level and its recognition by political leaders. These intersections favor the production of religious militancy and development of pastors as territorial mediators and representatives of the State in the daily order of the most vulnerable sectors.

This article presents a comprehension of solidarity economic projects from the multiform reality of solidarity economy in Brazil. This article is a varied set of initiatives still seeking institutional identity and a proper legal framework, since they do not fit into traditional cooperativism or the so-called third sector. Using a set of studies conducted both in terms of conceptualization and of typological formulation such as ethnographic design, this study discusses the plural configuration of solidarity projects, analyzing different social actors in focus, such as urban, rural and traditional environments. It tries to demonstrate the cultural and symbolic diversity that exist, as well as its multiple origins and current challenges, as an example of the search for a specific legal milestone for the field.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This article focuses    on the appropriation of the subject of Internet and Politics by Brazilian Social    Sciences. To this end, we analysed 299 papers presented at 11 conferences in    the areas of Sociology, Political Science and Social Communication from 2000    to 2011 in Brazil. The methodology was based on content analysis in order to    map the main authors, research centres, political and technological objects,    theoretical approaches, methods, techniques and coverage areas of the papers    presented in each of these conferences. Our findings suggest significant growth    in the number of studies presented over the last few years, where 40.5% were    based mainly on qualitative research and 56.5% had an emphasis on the civil    society strand. Finally, our longitudinal analyses indicate some changes in    the field, with a growing number of studies carrying out empirical research,    and a tendency to focus on more specific digital tools instead of on the Internet    in general.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords:</b>    Internet and politics, digital democracy, academic research, political science,    Brazil</font></p> <hr noshade size="1"/>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite still being    considered a 'new media', the Internet is already a lady in her forties: the    Arpanet, its predecessor, was created during the Cold War period, between the    1960s and 70s, and the Internet as we know it today started to spread in the    beginning of the 1990s, just after the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989.    Since this happened, many authors and researchers have investigated, wondered    and argued about the impact of this media on many fields, including politics    and, more specifically, on the democratic system. Such reflections have tried    to assess how the technological aspects of the Internet, such as its interactivity,    multimedia characteristics and capacity to store information impact on political    systems and civil society organizations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, several studies    of political topics have addressed the changes related to the inclusion of Information    and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in social dynamics. Indeed, in Western    countries, the use of the Internet by the most diverse types of political actors    and institutions participating in the political system has been the object of    systematic and empirically oriented analysis, especially in Anglo-Saxon nations    (Medaglia, 2012; S&aelig;b&oslash;, Rose and Flak, 2008; Susha and Gr&ouml;nlund,    2012). In fact, Chadwick and Howard (2009) have indicated that studies on Internet    and Politics have overmatched research on mass media and politics in the English    language.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, as in    many other countries, there is a broad and continuous amount of publishing in    this field. There are studies on the opportunities for participation offered    by the State to the civil sphere (Braga, Fran&ccedil;a and Nicol&aacute;s, 2009;    Bragatto 2008; Nicol&aacute;s 2009); on online campaigns and the impact of the    Internet on electoral disputes (Aggio, 2010); debates about the effects of the    Internet on party organization (Albuquerque and Martins, 2010); issues related    to new political practices (Penteado et al., 2011); reflections on the potential    of the Internet as a public sphere and for online deliberation (Sampaio et al.,    2011); on the uses of new media by civil society organizations (Maia, 2006);    and on the relation between new media and social inequality (Moraes et al.,    2009), among others.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the systematization    efforts of the Brazilian studies, Rothberg (2008) has revised part of the area's    national publications in order to propose a research agenda in digital democracy,    and, through an analysis of the research findings, has aimed to assess to what    extent the Internet is allowing civil society to participate in defining the    agenda and public policies. His conclusions suggest some avenues of research,    among which are studies for verifying the quality of participation in the process    of production and evaluation of public policies and for checking the focus and    scope of such initiatives. Moreover, he emphasises the need to evaluate the    forms of moderation of discussions and website design, as well as the quality    of information provided to support processes of public consultation.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the Brazilian    bibliography is extensive and although there are efforts to try to identify    and summarize the study questions, initiatives to map the Brazilian research    that seek to gather data on academic publishing are still rare. Other than the    efforts made by Amaral and Montardo (2011), Ara&uacute;jo (2011) and Bragatto    and Nicol&aacute;s (2011), we cannot find attempts that would enable a systematic    recognition of the state of the art, that is, by major universities or authors,    or the approaches, themes and objects that have guided research in the field    in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose of    this paper is therefore to present the results of our research on the appropriation    of the Internet and Politics theme as an object of study by Brazilian Social    Sciences, especially by Sociology, Political Science and Communication. To this    end, we analysed papers presented on the subject at some of the major conferences    held in Brazil from 2000 to 2011 (N= 299).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to present    our research, we have organized this article as follows: (1) first, we carry    out a short review of the studies on Internet and Politics, emphasizing the    digital democracy approach; (2) second, we present a summary of the methodology    employed; (3) third, we examine some empirical evidence of the research; (4)    and finally, we close the paper with some considerations and notes about the    research agenda.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Internet and    Politics</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the same way    as in the advent of the telegraph, radio and television, discussions about the    impact of the Internet on political activities have been accompanied by what    could be termed the discourse of technological determinism - the rhetoric about    radical changes caused by the social and political appropriation of new technological    artefacts. Throughout history, there has been the idea that new technologies    would promote, invigorate or cause ruptures in the democratic system (Wright,    2006).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering the    impact of the Internet on democracy, Vedel (2006) identifies three main "ages".    The first one emerged in the 1950s with cybernetic sciences under Norbert Wiener's<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>    supervision. At that time, the idea was to use computer technology and automated    systems to re-evaluate the processes of political negotiation and conflict resolution.    Thus, computers would function as new mediators, since it became possible to    process large amounts of information and to arrive at more "rational" conclusions.    Of course, this approach was strongly criticized for its over-simplification    of politics "into a practical, scientific system that can respond to the environment    in predictable manners and achieve well-defined goals, and termed (...) technocracy"    (ibidem, pp. 227).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second age    of electronic democracy was from the 1970s to the 1980s with the proliferation    of cable TV networks and the first private computers. According to Vedel, it    was highly influenced by social movements which defended that "society would    be better transformed from the bottom up and the coordination of local actions    rather than through the conquest of the state central apparatus" (idem, p. 228).    Thus, local communities were considered the key political arenas for participation    experiments. Television was used to broadcast public hearings, debates and citizen    discussions, enabling interactivity through telephone callbacks. This phase,    usually known as 'teledemocracy', faced several technological limitations, such    as a lack of real interactivity, and interconnectivity problems with computer    networks. Nevertheless, Vedel recognizes that this period of experimentation    generated active interest for the democratic potentials offered by ICTs (see    also Arterton, 1987).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third stage    started with the emergence of the commercial Internet in the 1990s and was accompanied    by a new ideology of freedom of information and of cyberspace itself (Coleman,    2007; Vedel, 2006). Vedel (2006) defends that the first visions were based on    the 'Californian ideology', which stands for social solidarity, political liberalism    (i.e. less power for the State) and ecological concerns. Hence the Internet    was not just a tool for democracy, "it creates a new way of being together and    a novel polity, which no longer takes place within the bounded territories of    nation states, but in an open, de-territorialized, non-hierarchical space" (Vedel,    2006: pp. 229).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his turn, Coleman    (2007) believes that the emergence of the Internet led to an impetus for grandiose    narratives of technocratic determinism. These narratives were based on two main    assumptions. Firstly, the Internet was regarded as a new frontier, a deterritorialized    cyber-utopia beyond comprehension or control by the State. Secondly, the feedback    possibilities would allow everyone to vote directly on every issue and it would    defy 'old' forms of political representation (i.e. direct democracy).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the subsequent    years (from the late 1990s until the early 2000s), several empirical research    projects were carried out to test these points of view. Not surprisingly, the    majority of the studies found that the introduction of these new technologies    did not result in immediate and profound changes in hard politics. Some even    called this 'politics as usual', since the political system actors adapted the    new technologies to their own agenda and needs (Margolis and Resnick, 2000;    Wilhelm, 2000).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, as    the analysis progressed, the initial question "what can the Internet do for    democracy?" was replaced by others about how the different media, channels and    digital tools that make up the Internet can be used by individuals, organizations    and institutions involved or interested in the political system to enhance democratic    values. To this, we can add several variables such as socioeconomic and cultural    factors, party ideology, level of Internet access, digital literacy, etc. Likewise,    the willingness of political representatives to implement or accept such innovations    and the motivation of citizens to create or seize such opportunities have become    subjects of study (Gomes, 2011; Marques, 2010; Medaglia, 2012; S&aelig;b&oslash;    et al., 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this way, we    would like to highlight four important issues that have guided our research:    theory, design of digital tools, strands and methodology. Firstly, regarding    the theory, just as different views of democracy have always been present in    discussions on political theory, the same is true about research focusing on    the impact of the Internet on the experience of democracy. Liberals emphasize    the need for greater visibility and accountability. Supporters of strong democracy    call for a conformation of spaces in which citizens can express their will directly.    Deliberative democracy theorists emphasize the importance of exchanging rational    arguments in public and the public sphere issue (Dahlberg, 2011; Gomes, 2007).    Regarding our study, we have analysed the different theoretical approaches used    by researchers and whether or not they bear any relation to the political objects.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the design    of digital tools, one cannot ignore that this is a direct consequence of political    forces behind its development (Chadwick, 2006; Gomes, 2011; Salter 2004). But,    more than that, several factors can hinder or foster online political participation    and the adoption of online tools, and design is considered an important variable.    Some research projects have already indicated that a poorly designed website    can inhibit political discussion (Janssen and Kies, 2005) and participation    in e-government (Bezerra and Jorge, 2010) and e-democracy projects (Sampaio,    Maia and Marques, 2011). Finally, the different options and features of each    digital tool should be considered in this evaluation. For instance, one could    analyse the need for identification, the role of moderation, technical features    of each software (e. g. how reply and feedback work, if it is voice or text-based,    if it is possible to send/upload images, videos, files, emoticons and so on,    if it is more "online forum-like" or if it resembles a social network website),    etc (Janssen and Kies, 2005; Salter, 2004; Wright and Street, 2007). Of course,    design should not be regarded as the main deciding factor for whether digital    initiatives succeed or not, as this would be a sort of technical determinism    (Coleman and Blumler, 2009). Nevertheless, ignoring this question could also    lead to an incomplete evaluation (Marques, 2010). Hence, this study will both    map the different technological tools (websites, blogs, wikis or social networks,    for example) and the political objects (i.e. government or organized civil society)    analysed in Brazilian studies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirdly, a distinction    that helps this study is the classification of the work into the social or the    institutional strand (Gomes, 2007). The former focuses on (but is not limited    to) the implications of the new media for civic engagement, the public sphere,    political deliberation and its relation to social capital. Common to all these    points is a concern for the political education and political skills of the    citizenry in cyberspace. That is, how the Internet can provide suitable places    for the formulation of preferences, strengthening of links between groups with    the same interests, organization of social demands and ripening of political    and ideological positions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "institutional    view" addresses three things:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a) the study      on the digital conformation of democratic institutions in a strict sense (digital      cities and governments, online parliaments) or in a broad sense (online political      parties); b) the institutional initiatives in the vector that goes from State      to citizens (such as the provision of online public services and e-government);      and c) institutional initiatives in the citizen to State vector (opportunities      for participation or offer of input by the citizenry in the form of votes,      responses to surveys, budget decisions or suggestions, records and discussion      of opinions in electronic forums, etc.) (Gomes, 2007: pp. 11).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The considerations    here are of a more structural order, since they relate to the organization of    democratic dynamics and, consequently, the link between institutions of the    democratic State and the citizenry.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>    These two strands will be verified in the Brazilian research papers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, one should    consider the methodological approach of the different research projects themselves.    According to Macintosh and Whyte (2008), incomplete or incorrect methods account    for some low results from the e-participation fields. Astr&ouml;m and Gr&ouml;nlund    (2012) show strong evidence for this hypothesis with their analysis on the results    of several research projects in the field. They found that the better the evaluation,    the better the results; in other words, badly designed research could lead to    false/incomplete results.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a>    Although there is some degree of determinism in this statement, since it denies    the reality of the study object and establishes that low research results are    due to a bad investigation method (and what is a desirable method is largely    a normative definition), it also indicates the need for different methods for    distinct purposes. In relation to the present study, this means that a large    variety of objects should, in some way, be followed by an equivalent quantity    of methods and techniques. That could be considered an indicator of an epistemologically    mature field.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the above    theoretical assumptions, which are not exhausted by the authors or the ideas    mentioned, in the next section we will move on to a presentation of the methodology    for analysing the papers presented at conferences in Brazil, considering these    four points as starting points. Three main research questions guided the construction    of our methodology and database:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font><font  size="2">&#8226;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">      Research Question 1: <i>Is the Internet and Politics field in Brazil showing      signs of growth, stabilization or reduction?</i></font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font><font  size="2">&#8226;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">      Research Question 2: <i>Was such a tendency followed by an equal distribution      of research among the different regions of Brazil? Or could one identify a      concentration of leading institutions and objects of research?</i></font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font><font  size="2">&#8226;</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">      Research Question 3: <i>Finally, what are the main elements of the Internet      and Politics field regarding its theoretical approach, research object and      methodology?</i></font></p> </blockquote>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Methodology</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our methodology    was structured so as to construct variables allowing a comparative analysis    of papers about Internet and Politics mapped in the selected conferences. Similar    research has already been conducted, especially abroad. We highlight the work    of Kr&aelig;mmergaard and Schlichter (2011), which lists 450 articles on e-government    from 2000 to 2009, of S&aelig;b&oslash; et al. (2008), who found 131 articles    on e-participation published until 2006, and of Medaglia (2012), who, in continuity    with the research by S&aelig;b&oslash; and team analysed 123 articles on e-participation    in the period from 2006 to 2011. In turn, Susha and Gr&ouml;nlund (2012) worked    only with articles presenting e-participation frameworks (N=50) and Astr&ouml;m    and Gr&ouml;nlund (2012) dealt only with research covering specific e-participation    projects (N=58). Nevertheless, there are still few research projects covering    countries other than Europe and the United States, especially comparative ones    (Chadwick and Howard, 2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, as mentioned    before, there is still a gap in such comparative studies (Rothberg, 2008). There    are few studies focused on mapping research related to Internet and Politics.    We found only three. First, Amaral and Montardo (2011) made an analysis of all    the papers presented in the Cyberculture sessions at the Intercom Meeting from    2001 to 2010 (N=443) and identified 13 major themes in the studies. Secondly,    Ara&uacute;jo (2011) listed the Brazilian works in the area of cyberactivism    from 2000 to 2010 (N=22) and classified them according to the publication period,    the authors' area and institution, the research object and bibliographical sources.    Finally, Bragatto and Nicolas (2011) mapped studies presented at four Brazilian    conferences between 2006 and 2010 (N=71), which were categorized according to    themes, objects of study, types of approach, methods and research techniques.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is noteworthy    that, in order to perform this research, there was an apparent need to define    the concept of politics. We chose the broad concept of politics proposed by    Maia, "not only restricted to the world of governments and the function of defining    votes by citizens, but one that also encompasses the processes of civic association,    negotiation and conflict among subjects in day-to-day interactions" (2006, pp.15).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initially, it was    necessary to separate political activity from acts of sociability to avoid grouping    very disparate researches. Therefore, we considered two key questions. The first    was the object of study and the second, the objective made explicit by the authors.    The papers were only included in the sample if their object and/or objective    were directly related to political actors or political activities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding our sample,    we considered the main Sociology, Political Science and Communication conferences    held on Brazilian territory. The period covered goes from 2000 to 2011. Besides    believing that a decade of analysis leads us to more general conclusions and    to a better monitoring of the field's trajectory, it is also the case that the    first annals of Brazilian conferences became available online in 2000.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We analysed 299    papers presented at 11 conferences. We checked all annals and proceedings available    online. In order to apply the questionnaire, we used three progressive rules    as follows: 1) initially, we checked only the title and the abstract, 2) if    this was not sufficient, we also evaluated the introduction and conclusion and,    if any doubts remained, 3) various parts of each paper were examined.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the testing    and subsequent refinement of the criteria, three pilot studies were conducted.    In the first one, 30 papers were analysed and the problems and difficulties    reported, which led to changes and improvements in the indicators. In the second    pilot test, the application was remade with the 30 original papers and another    30 were added, but using the new categories created after the first pilot. Finally,    the third test involved the application of the criteria to another 30 papers    different from the previous 60. Small changes were made to the spreadsheet,    which then reached its final form, as described below.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a) Conferences<i>:</i>      we considered the seminars, conferences, meetings and symposia held in Brazil.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Altogether, we    analysed 299 papers presented at 11 conferences on Brazilian territory. We listed    36 papers from the Meeting of the National Association of Post-Graduate Programmes    in Communication (<i>Encontro da Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Nacional dos Programas    de P&oacute;s-Gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o em Comunica&ccedil;&atilde;o</i> - Comp&oacute;s)    from 2000 to 2011 (representing 12.0% of the sample), excluding 2003 and 2004    because there were no papers on the subject. Regarding the Meeting of the National    Association of Post-Graduation in Social Sciences (<i>Encontro da Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o    Nacional de P&oacute;s-Gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o em Ci&ecirc;ncias Sociais</i>    - Anpocs), 27 papers (9.0%) were evaluated from 2010 and 2011. From the Meeting    of the Brazilian Association of Researchers in Communication and Politics (<i>Encontro    da Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Comunica&ccedil;&atilde;o    e Pol&iacute;tica</i> - Compol&iacute;tica), we found 52 papers (17.4%) from    2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011 (therefore covering all of the association's meetings).    From the Brazilian Congress of Sociology (<i>Congresso Brasileiro de Sociologia</i>    - CBS), there were 10 papers (3.0%), from 2005, 2009 and 2011. From the Meeting    of the Brazilian Association of Political Science (<i>Encontro da Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o    Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica</i> - ABCP), we analysed 13 papers    (4.3%) from 2008 and 2010. From the National Seminar of Sociology &amp; Politics    (<i>Semin&aacute;rio Nacional de Sociologia &amp; Pol&iacute;tica</i> - UFPR),    there were 24 papers (8.0%), covering 2009, 2010 and 2011. From the Brazilian    Forum of Political Science (<i>F&oacute;rum Brasileiro de Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica</i>    - Ufscar) there were five papers (1.7%) from 2011. From the National Seminar    of Political Science (<i>Semin&aacute;rio Nacional de Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica</i>    - UFRGS), we evaluated 14 papers (4.7%) from 2008 until 2011. From the Meeting    of the Brazilian Association of Researchers in Cyberculture (<i>Encontro da    Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Pesquisadores em Cibercultura</i> - Abciber),    the analysis included 42 papers (14.0%) from 2008 through 2011. From the Congress    of the Brazilian Society of Interdisciplinary Studies in Communication (<i>Congresso    da Sociedade Brasileira de Estudos Interdisciplinares da Comunica&ccedil;&atilde;o</i>    - Intercom), we analysed 58 papers (19.4%) from 2001 until 2011. And, finally,    from the Latin American Congress on Public Opinion - Wapor (<i>Congresso Latino-americano    de Opini&atilde;o P&uacute;blica</i> - Wapor), there were 19 (6.4%) from 2011.<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the evolution    in the number of papers submitted each year, we can see in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05f01.jpg">Figure    1</a> that up until 2005 the percentage of papers presented did not exceed 2%    of the total sample. There is a notable curve in 2006 (6.7%), with a tendency    for papers presented over the years to increase. And finally, we can observe    that in 2011 there was a considerable percentage of papers (31.1% of the sample)    and that out of the 11 conferences analysed, papers were collected in nine of    them, indicating a significant and more homogeneous growth in publishing.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We found that 225    papers of the sample contained keywords, which is a very significant amount    (75.3%), especially because some conferences do not require their use. The presence    of key terms is essential for searching through the websites of the conferences    and through search engines on the Internet in general. Regarding the 10 most    commonly used terms, we found the word "Internet" 65 times in the abstracts,    making it the most frequent term. Next comes the word "cyberspace" used 18 times;    "electronic government", 14 times; "blog", 12 times; "communication" and "cyberdemocracy",    11 times each; "Internet and Politics", 10 times; "politics" and "Twitter",    nine times and, finally, the term "social networks", eight times.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Institutions    and Authors</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to    the authors, we analysed variables related to the institutions to which they    belonged, the region and state, education and area of their last degree, as    well as whether they wrote in co-authorship and if they belonged to any research    groups.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05t01.jpg">Table    1</a>, one can see that the seven<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a>    institutions that lead the publication of papers are UFBA (20.8%), followed    by PUC-SP (18.5%), UFMG (12.1%) and UFPR (10.4%). Together, the seven institutions    represent over half of the total sample (61.8%),<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a>    there being a perceptible concentration of research in the South and Southeast,    with UFBA, located in the Northeast of Brazil, being the exception. We believe    UFBA's leadership is probably related to the fact that it has one of the oldest    postgraduate programmes in the area of Communication in Brazil and because of    its pioneering research projects both in Political Communication and Cyberculture.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05t01.jpg">Table    1</a> also shows the analysis by institution, from which it is possible to evaluate    publishing profiles by states in Brazil. Indeed, the Southeast is the predominant    region,<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a> with a significant    concentration of publications (49.6%). This is not due to the work of only one    university - four universities contributed to this. The Southern region<a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14"><sup>14</sup></a>    came second (16.8%), but well below the Southeast. As far as Bahia's prominent    place is concerned, it is possible to establish a close relationship between    its placement and publications by UFBA. It is also worth mentioning that among    the seven leading institutions, six of them are public universities and five    are federal institutions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We identified 282    distinct authors in the 299 papers of our sample. Regarding the authorship of    the papers, a considerable amount was written by only one author (66.2%), representing    more than half of the sample. Although a large part was written in co-authorship    (33.8%), a very modest amount made a partnership between institutions (8%).    Of the papers with only one author, more than half were written by authors who    belong to a research group (57.5%). However, several authors did not specify    whether they participated or not in groups.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to    the title of the author, in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05f02.jpg">Figure 2</a> one can    see a concentration of authors with a high level of education: Ph.Ds (35.5%),    followed by Master's students (27.8%) and doctoral students (20.1%).<a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to    the area of the researchers' most recent degree, we noticed a concentration    of authors in the areas of Communication (43.5%)<a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a>    and Political Science (17.1%). If we add Sociology (9.7%) and Social Science    (8%) to these areas, there is a concentration of almost 80% of the sample. These    data show that a significant proportion of researchers participate in conferences    pertaining to their areas of academic education and that the conferences analysed    tend not to be so interdisciplinary.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05f03.jpg"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We found that the    first 20 authors presented an average of four papers in the period analysed,    representing 28% of the sample.

By crossing the type of strand and the    conferences (<a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05t02.jpg">Table 2</a>), one can see that those    conferences related to the areas of Politics and Sociology (Anpocs, ABCP, Compolitica,    F&oacute;rum Brasileiro de Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica) favoured the institutional    papers. Yet this is not a rule, since other conferences belonging to the same    areas (Semin&aacute;rio Nacional de Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica, Semin&aacute;rio    Sociologia &amp; Pol&iacute;tica, CBS) had more papers on the social strand.    However, in the conferences related to the area of Communication (ABCiber, Comp&oacute;s    and Intercom), papers on the social strand prevailed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05t02.jpg">Table    2</a> shows the relationship between the strands and the leading academic institutions.    Most notable are UFBA and UFPR, with the majority of papers belonging to the    institutional strand. On the other hand, UFMG, UFRJ and USP showed research    that was significantly more focused on the social strand. This is possibly explained    by research areas and groups related more to one strand than the other.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05t03.jpg">Table    3</a> provides information on the theoretical approaches and the political objects.    One can see that the "participation" category (N=62) was the most recurrent    and that "engagement" came second (N=36), which reveals the intention of researchers    to understand to what extent the Internet can provide new ways and channels    for citizens to take part in political processes. The "representation" category    (N=2) was the least used, which is also symptomatic of research interests in    the field.<a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is remarkable    to see that the main theoretical approaches can be characterized as part of    the digital democracy field (Gomes, 2007). If we add the categories 'participation',    'engagement' and 'deliberation', the result accounts for over 40% of our sample.    Other approaches that are generally prominent in international studies, such    as political strategy, elections, digital inclusion and political economy, have    reached relatively small values in our sample.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, we need    to consider two things regarding participation overrepresentation. Firstly,    there are studies that deal with political participation in democratic theory    while others deal with more "abstract" concepts of participation based on Cyberculture.    Although they are different, both were classified as "participation" - something    that other researchers could try to differentiate in future research. Nevertheless,    we believe that the participation category would still be the most present one,    not only because of the recent Brazilian history of struggle against dictatorship,    but mainly because of the even more recent redemocratization process and all    the related concerns with civil society entering the decision-making processes    (a concern present in the 1988 Brazilian Federal Constitution), which emphasises    the role of political participation in democratic processes.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the political    objects, the category "non-organized civil sphere" was the one that showed the    maximum value (27.1%) - however, "government" showed a small difference (25.1%).    One can notice a preponderance of studies related to spontaneous manifestations    by society, and of research involving issues close to the executive, legislative    and judicial branches. The longitudinal study revealed no significant differences    between the political objects throughout the years and was not included. Similar    results were found in the work of Medaglia (2011) about research on e-participation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, when crossing    data on approaches and research subjects, as seen in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05t03.jpg">Table    3</a>, some significant findings were made. First of all, the participation    approach was mainly used to analyse the government (41.9%). Considering that    e-gov was not a prominent topic in our sample, this finding suggests that Brazilian    researchers are interested in seeing participation in government-led initiatives    or, at least, participation with a direct impact on government. This echoes    the studies from the e-participation field in the English language context (S&aelig;b&oslash;    et al., 2008; Susha and Gr&ouml;nlund, 2012). On the other hand, the online    deliberation studies in Brazil were more related to the non-organized civil    sphere. This specific result may be better assessed in future studies. We believe    that these studies were more interested in verifying the political conversations    among citizens; however, one could argue that the problem is that the government    itself is not interested in promoting online deliberation initiatives.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Still regarding    the objects of study, the actions by the civil sphere (whether organized or    not) represent more than 43% of our corpus and the majority were analysed using    the engagement approach. This could be connected to a more "grassrootist" notion    of democracy, in which the hope for democratic improvements lies in social movements.    According to this vision, the State is an agent to be beaten or even conquered.    Future studies may check the reason for this focus on social institutions<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can also highlight    the low value achieved by research regarding political parties (2%), which confirms    the impressions of Albuquerque and Martins (2010) about the low interest of    Brazilian researchers in the relation between political parties and ICTs.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regard to    the technological objects, the broader technological categories were the most    frequent, with 35.8% (N=130) of papers about the "Internet" (in a general way)    and another 28.8% (N=86) about "websites". Together they represent over 64%    of the sample. In turn, the technological objects of "web 2.0" (blogs, wikis    and social networks) still represent only 24.5% of the corpus - if combined    together.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, after    the longitudinal analysis, one can see that the "Internet" category was the    most studied until 2003. Thereafter, other platforms become more prominent,    such as studies on websites. In 2006, studies on blogs and social network websites    started to appear, with a significant increase until 2011. Therefore, we can    affirm that Brazilian research was able to keep up with technological evolution    and that there is an indication that new technological platforms (e.g. social    media) are going to be significant in Brazilian academic research.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05f04.jpg"></p>     ]]></body>

In <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05f05.jpg">Figure 5</a>, if we compare the types of studies    throughout the years, one can note that empirical studies have become more frequent    since 2007 and that theoretical papers are decreasing. Specifically, there is    a noticeable difference in 2011 between the studies of an empirical (78.5%)    and a theoretical (21.5%) nature.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regarding the type    of method used, a considerable number of papers were of a qualitative nature    (40.5%), followed by bibliographical papers (33.1%) and, finally, quantitative    papers (26.4%). A small percentage applied some kind of statistic (27.8%), in    contrast with the 216 papers that did not, representing more than 70% of the    sample. Of the 83 papers that used statistics, we highlight the preponderance    of simple frequency (69.9%), followed by the use of descriptive statistics (22.9%)    and only a small use of inferential statistics (7.2%).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, according    to the longitudinal analyses in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05f06.jpg">Figure 6</a>, the    use of statistics has been increasing in the last few years. In particular,    one can verify a remarkable increase in the use of descriptive statistics from    2007 onwards, and of inferential statics from 2010.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, according    to <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/05f07.jpg">Figure 7</a>, a significant number of papers have    employed "content analyses" (72%). If there should be an "ecology" of available    techniques, since distinct objects and approaches require distinct techniques,    both the concentration of "content analysis" and the relative absence of other    techniques are a cause for concern. We do not wish to defend that some techniques    are linked to the best types of research, but we note that there are few techniques    being used in the Brazilian Internet and Politics field. Future studies could    try to understand whether this fact is related to research choices or if certain    techniques are not available to most researchers.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Initially, regarding    our first research question, our analysis shows that the Internet and Politics    field in Brazil is indeed a mature research area and that it is attracting more    studies over the years. With respect to our second research question, in other    words, the distribution of research among the different regions of Brazil and    the existence of concentrations related to authors and objects in general, numerous    disparities can be noticed, especially regarding the authors. The sample points    to a concentration of research in leading academic publishing institutions (UFBA,    PUC-SP, UFMG, UFPR), in South-eastern and Southern Brazil (except for UFBA,    located in the Northeast) and in the researchers themselves. This can be demonstrated    by both the fact that the first 20 authors alone represent almost one third    of the sample (28%) and by the existing 282 different authors, which shows that    a significant proportion accomplished only one research project in the area    - at least among those presented in conferences. The study also points to apparently    little practical interest in changing this situation, since only 8% of the research    projects showed institutional partnerships. Regarding the study area, we noted    that almost half of the sample pertains to Social Communication (43.5%), which    is almost twice as great as the other two areas, Political Science (17.1%) and    Sociology (9.7%).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, concerning    research question 3, we could identify the main elements of the field and some    changes over the years. Regarding the strands (Gomes, 2007), there was a slight    preponderance of the social strand (56.5%) over the institutional one (43.5%),    which is probably connected to the fact that the area of Communication has favoured    this branch of study (since there was a greater balance between Political Science    and Sociology).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In turn, the technological    object was the one that underwent the greatest change over time. The Brazilian    researchers initially focused on major questions and conducted their research    on the Internet in general. Over time, more specific objects began to be addressed    and, more recently, blogs and social networks have gained prominence compared    to traditional objects, such as websites.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the methodological    variables, we can highlight the presence of empirical studies (65.9%), but there    was great variation from 2000 to 2011. Initially, there was a preponderance    of theoretical papers and currently the majority focuses on empirical studies.    On the other hand, it is still noticeable that few apply statistical techniques    (27.8%) and, among these, the majority (69.9%) applies only simple frequency.    Only 7.2% used techniques of inferential statistics.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout this    text, we have indicated some possibilities for future research. For example,    the concentration of research in the Southeast and South of the country can    be related to either a greater number of researchers in these regions and/or    to the presence of some prominent researchers in institutions located in these    areas. Moreover, our mapping indicates that the Brazilian Internet and Politics    field has paid more attention to issues related to digital democracy and to    the civil sphere. Moreover, these results could initially be compared to other    Latin American countries and, later, to Europe and the United States, searching    for differences and similarities among these groups.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, one can    see that certain methodologies are still underused by Brazilian researchers    and a survey might better understand the reasons for this. There is still the    possibility of future studies analysing the articles published in Brazilian    journals of Social Communication, Political Science and Sociology, which would    allow us to both verify our findings and compare the differences between initial    papers (conferences) and final articles (journals).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, research    on Internet and Politics in Brazil is growing significantly and our study indicates    a greater consolidation of an autonomous and interdisciplinary field. A significant    tendency towards empirical works with more specified objects can be verified,    which demonstrates that the area is moving from a more general reflection to    an analysis and examination of specific objects, uses and promoters of digital    initiatives, as well as of the possible effects and consequences.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This research has    some limitations, however. Firstly, we opted for classifying the articles using    their "emphasis", which can lead to distortions. Some articles may have more    than one theoretical approach or even use two empirical techniques. Nevertheless,    we believe that our methodological choice not only allows statistical analysis    but also effectively highlights the emphasis of the studies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second limitation    is related to the lack of explanation for the results. Several findings were    presented but we did not question their causes. Our main objective was to map    the field, something that had not yet been done. We believe that now other researchers    can focus on those findings and try to understand their causes and explanations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thirdly, we tried    to deal with all the bibliography available, but some articles were not found,    something that can be attributed to the poor quality of the websites of the    conferences and associations, which often do not even have a search engine.    Still, we believe that the corpus is very close to the entire bibliography presented    in conferences in the Brazilian field of Internet and Politics between 2000    and 2011.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     ]]></body>

<body><![CDATA[<br>   <a name="back2"></a><a href="#top2">2</a> For instance, "In 2006, 113 articles    dealt with television and politics, while 424 were concerned with the internet    and politics" (Chadwick and Howard, 2009: 2).    <br>   <a name="back3"></a><a href="#top3">3</a> This paper aims to map and describe    the Brazilian Internet and Politics field, not establish causal relationships    between the main findings. Questions such as "why did Brazilian researchers    prefer some topics over others?" or "how did these concentrations happen?" are    topics for future research.    <br>   <a name="back4"></a><a href="#top4">4</a> Wiener is considered the originator    of cybernetics, a formalization of the notion of feedback, with many implications    for engineering, computer science, and the organization of society. For more    information, see: <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener</a></u>.    <br>   <a name="back5"></a><a href="#top5">5</a> For a broader discussion on issues    of the institutional strand, see Chadwick (2006) and Gomes (2011).    <br>   <a name="back6"></a><a href="#top6">6</a> The authors also recognize that this    is an indication. One could not confirm <i>a priori</i> if it is the approach    of the research projects or the quality of the initiatives the main factor for    their findings.    <br>   <a name="back7"></a><a href="#top7">7</a> Although the conferences are linked    to Communication, Political Science and Sociology, we wanted to check if there    was any preponderance among researchers from any of these segments. The areas    analysed were: (I) Communication, (II) Political Science, (III) Sociology, (IV)    Social Sciences, (V) Information Science, (VI) Administration, (VII) Law, (VIII)    Computer Science, (IX) Others.    <br>   <a name="back8"></a><a href="#top8">8</a> The categories result from theoretical    areas used by authors who deal with Internet and Politics issues (Bimber and    Davis, 2003; Braga 2007; Chadwick, 2006; Dahlberg, 2011; Gomes, 2007; Maia,    2011; Medaglia, 2011; S&aelig;b&oslash; et al, 2008).    <br>   <a name="back9"></a><a href="#top9">9</a> There are rallies and political demonstrations    clearly linked to associations, unions and civic groups. We classified as spontaneous    demonstrations those that were not explicitly presented as a movement or action    spearheaded by a group, such as the marches against Corruption in Brazil, the    Occupy Wall Street movement and the Arab Spring, for example.    <br>   <a name="back10"></a><a href="#top10">10</a> Some online annals were not available.    The Intercom makes all the annals from 2001 to 2011 available, but the 2004    annals were organized in a way that made it impossible to locate the papers.    Therefore, this year is not in our sample. The ABCP has only the last two conferences    (2008 and 2010) available online. Regarding the Brazilian Forum of Political    Science (<i>F&oacute;rum Brasileiro de Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica</i> - Ufscar),    we could only find online the annals of 2011 onwards. Finally, we only found    the 2011 online annals of WAPOR, which were included because it was held in    Brazil. In the case of CBS, the annals were available from 2000 onwards, but    we only found papers on the theme in the annals from 2005, 2009 and 2011.    <br>   <a name="back11"></a><a href="#top11">11</a> Federal University of Bahia (<i>Universidade    Federal da Bahia</i> - UFBA); Pontifical Catholic University of S&atilde;o Paulo    (<i>Pontif&iacute;cia Universidade Cat&oacute;lica</i> - PUC-SP); Federal University    of Minas Gerais (<i>Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais</i> - UFMG); Federal    University of Paran&aacute; (<i>Universidade Federal do Paran&aacute;</i> -    UFPR); University of S&atilde;o Paulo (<i>Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</i>    - USP); Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (<i>Universidade Federal do Rio    de Janeiro</i> - UFRJ); Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (<i>Universidade    Federal do Rio Grande do Sul</i> - UFRGS).    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<br>   <a name="back12"></a><a href="#top12">12</a> We only took into account the main    author's institution.    <br>   <a name="back13"></a><a href="#top13">13</a> The South-eastern region includes    the states of S&atilde;o Paulo, Rio Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Esp&iacute;rito    Santo.    <br>   <a name="back14"></a><a href="#top14">14</a> The Southern region includes the    states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paran&aacute;.    <br>   <a name="back15"></a><a href="#top15">15</a> The longitudinal graph showed that    there was no significant variation in education and therefore was not included.    <br>   <a name="back16"></a><a href="#top16">16</a> The dominance of Communication    researchers is not a Brazilian characteristic though. According to Tomasello    et al. (2010: 538), "media-oriented journals publish nearly half of all internet    and related digital new media articles" and "a core set of 14 communication,    or related, journals currently publishes new media research" in English.    <br>   <a name="back17"></a><a href="#top17">17</a> Again, the longitudinal graph indicated    similar growth among the areas and was not included.    <br>   <a name="back18"></a><a href="#top18">18</a> Longitudinal analyses have not    revealed significant differences and were not included.</font></p>      ]]></body><back>

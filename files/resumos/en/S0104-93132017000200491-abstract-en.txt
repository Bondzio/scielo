Abstract The article describes ajuda (help) relations among inhabitants of the Tejo River Basin, on the Upper Juru√° River, in southeastern Acre, Brazil. It begins with a summary of previous works on Amazonian communities and how they have described ajuda relations as gift relations with connection to kinship and territoriality. Based on ethnographic data, the article argues that ajuda goes beyond the material aspects of exchange, creating and maintaining relations between exchange partners. They also go beyond communities' physical boundaries and impact the regional economy and politics as redistributive practices, providing perspective on the value produced in exchange.

This article aims to identify the concurrences and divergences in the development of proposals for continuing education, financed by the World Bank - IBRD -, taking the experiences of Minas Gerais and São Paulo as a reference. On the one hand, there exists evidence that these states are elaborating their proposals for continuing education financed by the World Bank, incorporating the orientations of the institution to differing degrees, since the same degree of autonomy of the universities and to the teaching establishments in which they participate. On the other hand, research in the field of continuous education have pointed to issues that were not taken into consideration in these projects and their implementation. To discuss such issues, the article, from the outset, analyzes concepts of teacher training in World Bank documents. Following that, the experiences of Minas Gerais and São Paulo are discussed, seeking to identify continuities and ruptures with the Bank's proposals. Finally, based in the literature on continuing education, some of the results and consequences of implementing projects in the two states mentioned are discussed.

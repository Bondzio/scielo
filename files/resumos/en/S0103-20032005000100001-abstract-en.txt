The high foreign debt and the chronic current account deficit force Brazil to produce significant trade surplus. Agriculture has been giving a great contribution as its export value has been growing at higher rates than economy other products; therefore there is a welcome agricultural trade surplus. However, to depend on agriculture as main source of exchange value puts the country in a vulnerable situation: the world demand for agricultural products is relatively decreasing, the agricultural trade prices and amounts variability are bigger than of industrialized products, and the agricultural terms of trade have been declining in the last 30 years. Those facts allow conclude that the justification of the substitution of imports model is pertinent again and that the increase in export amounts of agricultural products not necessarily imply the Brazilians welfare improvement.

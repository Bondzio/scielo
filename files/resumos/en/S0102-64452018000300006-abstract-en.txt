Abstract This article aims to analyze the meanings of the public financing of sociopolitical activities and their impact on the action and political projects of popular movements, focusing on the relation established between State and society through the agreement during the administrations of former presidents Lula and Dilma. To do so, a case study was conducted in Heliopolis, a favela in SÃ£o Paulo (Brazil), articulated with the systematization of secondary literature regarding educational policies at the national level in PT administrations. The concept of &#8220;perverse confluence&#8221; was employed to analyze the meaning that the agreements assume for popular movements, as well as to discuss the paradoxes that the access to public resources brings to popular-democratic forces, which occupied an unequal and dependent position in relation to neoliberal forces in the Brazilian political scene in the 2000s.

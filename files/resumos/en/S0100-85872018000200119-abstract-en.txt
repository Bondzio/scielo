Abstract The concept of laicity in Latin America was built largely as a mechanism to consolidate the national states, with the passing of time this concept has been multivocal when not equivocal in many ways. What is undoubted is that it has served as a reference for the autonomy of the political space in the face of religion, specifically in the face of religious institutions. For laicity, the issue of religion is not a matter of cultural diversity but fundamentally political and legal. In the present text, we will deal with the different concepts of laicism and its uses in Latin America, the categorical difference with respect to secularization, taking into account their differences and intersections. In the end, we will analyze how laicity has managed religious diversity in the political and a comparative perspective about how this diversity has been managed between Latin America and Europe.

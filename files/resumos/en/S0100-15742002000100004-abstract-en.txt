This article presents some of the initiatives taken by the public authorities to reduce violence in the school environment. Taking SÃ£o Paulo, Porto Alegre and Belo Horizonte as examples, it examines some of the practices in place since the 1980s, when the democratization process began in Brazil. Oscillating between educational measures and those strictly related to security, the activities still require continuity and a greater capacity for having an impact on the public schools in these cities. Nevertheless, based on these experiences, it is possible to discern the emerging profile of public policies intended to reduce violence in the teaching establishments of Brazilian society.

The Quilombola communities are fighting hard for the right to their traditional territories. A struggle which started before the legal instruments that influence the debates about the rights of rural black communities in Brazil were established in 1988. The struggles of these communities are for land not as a market good, but for a territory in which their own expressions and perceptions of the world are rooted. This article is based on field research conducted with the Quilombola communities, in the municipality of Salvaterra, Island of Maraj&#243;, Brazil and describes how these communities define the appropriation of spaces such as land, forest, rivers and houses. It reveals that the Quilombola spaces are imbued with the symbolic expressions of these populations' ways of being and living.

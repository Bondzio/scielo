The article examines the labour situation in Brazil. It interprets official statistics on occupation through an analysis of the economic policy implemented in the country over the last decade. Its theoretical starting point is the hypothesis that although the contemporary process of globalization has universal implications for work, we need to analyse the national reality through a reconstruction of its internal dynamic: this analysis shows improvements in the inclusion of women and the black population in formal employment, although large gender and racial inequalities still persist in the Brazilian labour market.

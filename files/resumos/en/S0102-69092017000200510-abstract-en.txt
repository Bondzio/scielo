The relevance of the concept of liberty as non-domination presented by Philip Pettit in his republican theory has already been admitted by feminist theorists like Anne Phillips and Iris M. Young. However, if liberty as non-domination, such as formulated by Pettit, is useful to identify and legitimize StateÂ´s actions whose aim is to struggle the subordination and dependence of women in relation with men, that concept does not seem a very comprehensive theoretical reference to struggle diffused forms of inequality, like gap of wage, and inequality of individual rights and of autonomy. In order to comprehend such situations, the purpose of this article is to enlarge the concept of liberty as non-domination, to present it as a referential capable to legitimize the State actions which are intended to avoid such inequalities.

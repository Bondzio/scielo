ABSTRACT This article aims to conduct an analysis of the text &#8220;Atitudes dos alunos dos grupos escolares em relação com a cor de seus colegas [Attitudes of students of public school in relation to the color of their colleagues]&#8221;, authored by the sociologist and psychoanalyst Virginia Leone Bicudo (1955). In this study, Bicudo examined the everyday school and family context of students, focusing on categories like race, gender and nationality, providing an analytical map from the perspective of the social sciences for the transdisciplinary analysis of childhood, transcending the biological and generational boundaries. This study was based on a review of the literature regarding the development of the field of research on childhood in Brazil, and the insertion and contributions of this author to the area. We believe that Bicudo&#8217;s work is one of the first that emphasized the individuality of children&#8217;s racial attitudes. The children themselves were the main informants and participants, through interviews.

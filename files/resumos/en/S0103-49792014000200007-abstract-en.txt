This study evaluates and interprets the difficulties found in the Chilean policy for transparency in municipalities, using the theory of social systems. This theory argues that, in Latin America's current context, public policies should respond to a society increasingly complex and diversified, with ever greater proximity to persuasion, dialog, and facilitation. In this case, the transparency policy, in terms of a first order intervention, has been a command-and-control policy, the reformulation of which should consider what this policy considers as transparency both for citizens and municipal employees.

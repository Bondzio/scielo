Abstract The text addresses the political and pedagogical uses of a conception of educational inclusion that has gained prominence in the public management of Brazilian education during the first decade of this new millennium. In order to do so, it uses an ethnographic reflection built as a public servant in the Department of Basic Education in the section of sociology and organizing the text around the interaction with a professional who participated actively in the organization of the State Secretariat of Education of Paran√° between the years 2003 and 2011. Thus, the objective of this analysis does not refer to the experiences of people in schooling, but to the institutional project that wanted to insert them in relatively stable and inclusionable pedagogical categories producing state organization and departamentalization based on the nomination and normatization of subjects. It is, therefore, an attempt to present state practices as well as their discursive justification related to multiculturalism, giving special emphasis to the prerogatives of inclusive education to deaf people.

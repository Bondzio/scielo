Abstract: The problem of gender discrimination at work is also evident in large companies. In general, men receive higher wages than women, even performing the same function. It is more difficult for women to reach high command position because of the &#8220;glass ceiling&#8221;. The fight against gender discrimination fostered by developments in labour law and public policy is essential to value the female workforce, but is unable to eliminate the differences in terms of career advancement and remuneration for men and women, even in enterprise market leaders. Initiatives to promote gender equity in the corporate world, included in corporate social responsibility programs, produce slow progress and require a change of organizational culture.

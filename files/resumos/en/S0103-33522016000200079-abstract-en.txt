Abstract This article proposes to discuss the relationship between the sociological theory, developed by Emile Durkheim and the classic conservative ideas. On the one hand, it seeks to understand to what extent the French sociologist absorbed conservative elements in his sociology and, on the other hand, if this supposed influence would suffice to attribute to the Durkheimian work a conservative rubric. With this, it is intended to prevent possible labels or typifications, almost always reductionist and unable to realize all the complexity that involves a theoretical production of great value like the work of Durkheim. The analysis is mostly bibliographic and revisionist and builds both on primary and secondary sources.

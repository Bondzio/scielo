This paper analyzes the process of agricultural county convergence in the state of Ceará using a threshold model in the period from 1970 to 1996. The results show the existence of four clubs of convergence. One formed by the group of richer counties; another one by the group of poor counties and two intermediate groups. The results intra-clubs show that both human capital and physical capital are important to explain the growth process of Ceará's agriculture. On the other hand land is important only for the two richer clubs.

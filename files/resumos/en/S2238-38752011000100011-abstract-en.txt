Abstract: The bold project of publishing the complete works of Max Weber, that has been held since 1976 under the direction of renowned German sociologists, motivates this interview with Wolfgang Schluchter, one of the head editors of MWG-Max Weber Gesamtausgabe [Max Weber - complete edition]. The interview aims to inquire about the current character of conceptual and theoretical tools of the German sociologist. What is the impact today of Weber's assumptions about the capitalist society on the academic and intellectual circles? To what extent the historical and critical edition of the complete works of Max Weber helps to stimulate new research issues in the field of sociology? To Schluchter, the critical edition project is not connected to intellectual fashions or fleeting preferences. He considers that, despite the limitations of the theoretical discussion in favor of empiricism, it is unlikely that the contribution of Weber regarding rationalization processes disappear from the sociological horizon.

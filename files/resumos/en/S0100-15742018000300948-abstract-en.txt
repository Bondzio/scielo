ABSTRACT Based on quantitative research on the meanings attributed by young university students to citizenship, this article focuses on sexual diversity and human rights. After a review on youth, and the policy on and perception of sexual diversity, we present a survey with 423 students, a sample with a 5 percent margin of error and a 95% confidence interval. A high percentage of students support generic notions of rights, but this frequency falls sharply when it comes to translating rights into public policy. The analysis of contingency tables between variables indicates the influence of sexual orientation, sex, and religion on meaning attribution, and of social belonging on religion. The paper discusses contradictions in the egalitarian discourse, considering social belonging and the guarantee of rights.

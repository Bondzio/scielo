This paper addresses the problem of water and energy consumption in the South                American mining from a perspective not much explored: the sustainable consumption.                From the point of view of sociology and the social studies of science and technology,                we expose the issue by presenting three different consumption patterns: conventional,                alternative and progressive. Based on both secondary sources and semi-structured                interviews, we looked into the controversies surrounding two Argentine historical                mining projects: Cerro Vanguardia and La Alumbrera, by focusing our questions around                sustainable consumption of resources such as water and energy. We noted the perceived                urgency to move towards sustainable consumption patterns, as well as whom are those                called to make it happen and what details would be needed at different scales to make                the transition. Taking into account that water and energy are fundamental factors for                the transition towards sustainable consumption patterns in mining, we propose that                they are central to the management of local conflicts in Latin American environmental                governance. This study is part of a larger research that encompasses several South                American countries.

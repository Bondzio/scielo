ABSTRACT The current situation of the Program for the Continuous Training of Physics teachers still lacks efficient and adequate procedures. It started effectively in the 1960s, when it was ascertained that the teaching of Science was not satisfactory; the Program&#8217;s objective was to train teachers capable of taking the new Science projects to the classrooms. The next step were specific training initiatives for the teacher development but these Projects have failed to solve the growing educational problems. In view of the increasing scientific and technology progress, this training should be able to provide a desirable teacher profile. This article discusses three factors of ongoing retraining: the passage from training project to teacher redevelopment, and from the teaching process to significant learning, and the building of professional competence.

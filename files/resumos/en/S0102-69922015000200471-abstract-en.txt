AbstractThis article aims to test the applicability of the Risk Society Theory proposed by Ulrich Beck for the contemporary Brazilian society, and to analyze its social distribution of risk perception associated with climate change and global warming. To do so, it reviews risk theories and discusses critically its application to the case of climate change. It presents then the results of the poll, which checked the effect of different socio-demographic variables on risk perception. The data come from public opinion poll in national scale, with stratified cluster sample. The main result achieved regards the homogeneity of risk perception across different social categories or geographical contexts. The only socio-demographic categories that showed significant influences on the assessment of risk perception were household income and education, both with a positive relationship.

Brazil was one of the first cases of the international reception of Pierre Bourdieu, who is one of the most cited sociologists in the country since the 1990s. This reception is discussed here along two historical lines: the production and consecration of Bourdieu's work in France, and the dynamics of institutionalization of Social Sciences in Brazil. Beginning in the late 1960s, the circulation of Brazilian researchers in France increased considerably, and some of them later became important mediators in the reception of Bourdieu in Brazil. Their trajectories and their roles are analyzed in this article. Initially incorporated as one of the main sources of theoretical and methodological renewal in the Social Sciences during the 1970s and 1980s, Bourdieu would become a primary reference in the 1990s, despite the resistance that his work also faced in Brazil.

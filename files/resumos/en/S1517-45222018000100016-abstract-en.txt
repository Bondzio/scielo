Abstract This essay is aimed to present the modern genesis of intellectuals and their figurations throughout a relatively recent history, up to the emergence of some impasses that suggest a crisis. Some paths are then proposed towards a reconfiguration that could enable them to face the challenges of the contemporary social world.

ABSTRACT The following article analyzes the role played by various intellectual traditions in the structuring of the output of Brazilian political science, referring to 23 national A1, A2 and B1 journals listed in the field of political science by the Qualis classification system and published in the 2010-2012 triennium. Based on categories such as journals, thematic areas and approaches, dimensional reduction techniques are used, demonstrating that certain intellectual traditions, whether &#8220;humanistic&#8221;, &#8220;scientific&#8221;, nomothetic or ideographic, contribute to the determining of this structure. Specific oppositions, such as those between &#8220;theoretical&#8221; and &#8220;empirical&#8221; traditions, also contribute to the structuring of this opposition. The article argues that Brazilian political science is developing its own identity, favoring a more orthodox scientific tradition.

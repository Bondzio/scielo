This paper analyzes the concept of intersectional discrimination and its importance to face discrimination. In the context of anti-discrimination law, it seeks to understand intersectional discrimination from its origins and the conceptual debates of Black Feminism. While checking the normative shortage in the protection systems of human rights and the incipient approach of intersectional discrimination, it approaches the importance of including the theme in the fight against discriminatory situations, aiming at the most effective application of the equality principle in Brazilian and Interamerican Law.

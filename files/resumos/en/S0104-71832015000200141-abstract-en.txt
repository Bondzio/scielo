AbstractThis article analyzes the processes of teaching and learning in two different social contexts experienced by farming families in the state of Paraná, and indigenous families Galibi-Marworno in the state of Amapá. Although schooling is considered important by these families and occupy a considerable time and investment of children, these contexts are here considered &#8220;deschooled&#8221; because the school is not a hegemonic source of knowledge for these children, who also learn from other situations experienced by them, mainly through participation in family production activities. Recognizing some common aspects of these learning processes, as the centrality of experience and corporeality, the attention to imitation efforts, the emphasis on learners&#8217; agency and the progressive attribution of responsibilities, the article aims to contribute to contemporary anthropological debates about cognition and learning.

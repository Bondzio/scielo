Abstract This discussion focus on the concept that there are different masculinities and, once submitted to a web of discourses, knowledge and power relationships, such processes impose subjugated truths, triggering objectification, subjectivation and can induce violence and suicide. Thus, this paper aims at discussing, from the mechanisms of objectivation and subjectivation, their implications regarding the building of masculinity amongst teenagers. The data was built from interviews done with 17 students from two Secondary and High Schools and the use of cyber space, guided by semi-structured interviews, allowed us to access and observe those speeches. The methodology used is founded on Michel Foucault&#8217;s concept of discourse and the selection of the subjects&#8217; speeches allowed us to signal how discourses influence male teenagers.

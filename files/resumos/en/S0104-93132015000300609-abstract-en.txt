Abstract This article analyses the relationships between curricula, the content of compulsory disciplines, and lecturers' understanding of the role of "classical" authors and works in six Brazilian postgraduate programmes in Anthropology. The article starts from the premise that the selection of authors, works and subjects in anthropology courses conveys a hierarchy of anthropological knowledge for teaching purposes. This hierarchy defines a canon for training new anthropologists in Brazil, but it also reflects idiosyncratic features of social relation in Anthropology postgraduate programmes. Based on a qualitative analysis of curricula and syllabuses in six programmes, as well as archival research and interviews with lecturers in four of the six programmes under analysis, topics such as inter-institutional and intergenerational relationships, division of labour, and social reproduction emerge as main questions in the light of notions as "classic" and "history".

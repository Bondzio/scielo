Feminist theory has constructed a particular criticism of pornography that is far from being uniform and takes the character of a debate. Its origins take place in the U.S. in the late seventies, where two positions consolidate: an anti-pornography and a pro-sex. In Spain authors like Raquel Osborne and Dolores Juliano assume the second posture, creating grounds for the consolidation of porn-feminism, which tries to eliminate andocentric biases of the pornographic speech, producing pornography with additional purposes besides the masturbatory.

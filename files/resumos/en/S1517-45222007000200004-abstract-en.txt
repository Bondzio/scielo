Poverty and inequality increased in Latin America during the late 20th century and early 21st century. Studies by different international institutions show that the number of poor people has grown in both relative and absolute terms in nearly every country, while concentrations of wealth have reached unprecedented levels, causing deep changes in the social structure. Such multiplication of poverty and inequality is partly a result of the failure of practices adopted under pressure from international credit and development agencies on behalf of the so-called Washington Consensus (privatization, market liberalization). Changes in the world of work have resulted in mass unemployment and greater vulnerability for millions of Latin Americans. Alongside this, small groups of individuals and families have begun to concentrate increasing proportions of wealth, widening the gap between the extremes of income distribution in each country. This article discusses the changes in social structure in Latin America and the legitimising strategies employed by the wealthy on the subcontinent, especially charitable neo-philanthropic institutions funded by musicians and major businesspeople. Finally, the author aims to discuss the issue of inequalities from the viewpoint of class-domination relations - a perspective that has been gaining ground in social sciences and that should be extended to the political agenda.

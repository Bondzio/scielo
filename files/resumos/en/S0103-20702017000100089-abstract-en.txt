Abstract This essay discusses the action of financial agents in popular context, under government policies promoted to achieve &#8220;financial inclusion&#8221; of low income sectors of population. It relies on an ethnographic observation realized in the first half of 2013 on a peripheral area of the city of Rio de Janeiro. In this area banking agencies have been installed since 2010, following government initiative&#8217;s to pacify the region, that is, to take control of the territory dominated by criminal organizations. The study analyzes broader issues such as upgrading or reconstruction social boundaries in processes of implementation of inclusive social policies.

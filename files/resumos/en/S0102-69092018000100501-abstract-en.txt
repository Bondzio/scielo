The article examines the justifications of the federal representatives to their votes in favor or against the opening of impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff and focuses on the differences between the reasons given by members of the Bancada Evangélica in comparison with the other members of the Câmara dos Deputados. The percentage of votes in favor of impeachment was 93.8% among evangelicals and 67.7% among non-evangelicals. The research sought to show that other differences would be revealed by the justifications of those votes. Starting from shorthand notes of the voting session, 26 different classes of reasons and motives were identified. The authors hope that the presented analysis of these data enable shed some new light on the involvement of Evangelicals in Brazilian politics. The research indicates, among other findings, that the Evangelical Caucus voted supported by justifications that belonged mostly to the universe of tradition instead of the democratic universe.

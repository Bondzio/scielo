Abstract In March 2015, the Law 13.104/15 established the qualifying of femicide, incorporating it to judges&#8217; discourses. In this work, we aim to point out that the criminal legal field is one of several areas in settling complex social relations, therefore, this field is not only the scene of social struggles, but it consists itself as an object in dipute. Thus, our central proposal is to systematize the main critics raised, so far, about the criminalization of femicide and, based on them, to produce a reflection on the meaning of the paradoxical struggle for this legalization at the national feminist scenario.

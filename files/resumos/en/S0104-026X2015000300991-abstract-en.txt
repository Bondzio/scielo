This article is based on my double condition of a researcher and a witness of the main events of Brazil's and Uruguay's dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. From a perspective of the present time, I visit the past through files and memories. My goal is to ask questions anchored in the present and in problematics of the current events, to search in the documents and bring them into life. In the same way I deal with the memories, focusing my recollections as an exiled person in Uruguay.

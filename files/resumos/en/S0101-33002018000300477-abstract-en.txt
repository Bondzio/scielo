ABSTRACT In the twentieth century, two philosophers, M. Heidegger and L. Wittgenstein, revisited the principles of our philosophy - that of the Greeks - and questioned its basis. In other words, they inquired about the concept of foundation itself: &#8220;Being&#8221; as wholeness, taken in multiple senses, through which any being that is receives meaning. If Being should be thought as time appropriating the man, Heidegger needs to define language itself as an exercise of approprieting every thing that is and the Being itsef. Wittgenstein, on the other hand, considers language as a game that deals with signs and objects. Therefore, questioning about being is a grammatical mistake. Consequently, for both philosophers, the concept of reason lacks meaning, independently of how we conceive it.

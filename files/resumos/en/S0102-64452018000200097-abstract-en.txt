Abstract The purpose of this article is to reconstitute the links between trade unionism stemming from the workers&#8217; and popular strikes that began in the late 1970s and the recent conditions of labor regulation in Brazil, with a particular focus on trade union activity in the Labor Relations Council (CRT), created in 2010. It is not a question of carrying out a balance of the last 40 years, either in the trajectory of Brazilian trade unionism or in the ways of regulating labor in the country. We have only followed the trade union trajectory since then, until we stop at the CRT, in its format and agenda, in order to analyze the possibilities and limits of trade union activity. In order to do so, we dialogue with the bibliography on the subject and with research and reflections accumulated by the authors, as well as supporting documentary research (CRT minutes, decrees, provisional measures and ordinances), media research and interviews with union and governor of the CRT.

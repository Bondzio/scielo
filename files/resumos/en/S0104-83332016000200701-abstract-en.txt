Abstract This article reflects challenges regarding the interrelations between gender, science and technology (GST). The context of the commemorative event of 20 years of the Gender Studies Center - PAGU, was a great opportunity to conduct such a debate, allowing us to do a collective analysis of the trajectory of this field in Brazil and abroad, especially about the contributions of PAGU in the last decades.

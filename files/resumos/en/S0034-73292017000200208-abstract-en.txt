Abstract Brazil&#8217;s involvement in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) since 2011 has allowed for a direct participation as part of international peace and security efforts in the Middle East, strengthening the country&#8217;s credentials as it presents itself as a &#8216;peace provider&#8217;. Informed by academic contributions on issues of responsibility and recognition, the article discusses Brazil&#8217;s engagement with particular reference to UNIFIL&#8217;s Maritime Task Force, and the implications of such participation for its broader foreign and defence policy agenda.

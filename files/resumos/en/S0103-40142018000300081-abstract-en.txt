ABSTRACT Mobile touchscreen devices - smartphones or tablets - constitute a physical extension of the body, and the communication that such interfaces enables is now understood as displacement. Considering specificities such as mobility, convergence and ubiquity, this article proposes six dimensions (contemporaneity, socio-technical, neuro-cognitive, perceptive-affective, discursive-communicative, political-pedagogical) that can be considered in teaching, learning or research in the Humanities, particularly in Education. Dimensions are delimited with traces of contemporaneity.

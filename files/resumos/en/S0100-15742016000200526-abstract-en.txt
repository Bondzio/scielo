In France, the issue of equal education for boys and girls and the struggle against inequalities based on gender categories is very present. This research should be contextualized with a view to fighting stereotypes in the school setting. Our interest is the knowledge that children develop throughout infancy and childhood regarding toys, seen here as a means of gender socialization. The results indicate an early knowledge of the stereotypes associated with certain toys, but also variations according to the type of toy and the age of the children. The experiences of socialization in the school setting can provide, by the intervention of teachers through educational interaction and ludic support, more heterogeneous experiences.

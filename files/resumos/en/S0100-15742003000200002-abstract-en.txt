In order to treat in an unbiased way the relationship between education and exclusion we first of all have to distinguish between what specifically concerns social exclusion and its resulting effects on school life, and exclusion strictly speaking at school. The present day situation is undoubtedly by the social process of exclusion being reinforced by the rise in inequalities due to unemployment. However the most striking and paradoxical phenomenon is the development of exclusion strictly speaking as a consequence of a determined unprecedented questioning of schools. The more schools develop their ascendancy the more they exclude, in spite of policies which try to attenuate the phenomenon. In this context exclusion is not simply a category of the system and global processes, but also one of the dimensions of pupils' experience of schooling.

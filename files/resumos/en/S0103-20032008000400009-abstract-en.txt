This article investigates the potential gains to the U.S. meat sector with the implantation of the U.S. National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The focus is on the effect that the NAIS could have on consumers' risk perception about eating meat. System of demand equations are estimated using time series of food safety indexes variables used as proxies for consumers' reactions to news on meat safety issues. The series of food safety indexes are built on the basis of the number of food safety news reported in top U.S. newspapers. Using the preferred model estimates, three scenarios are constructed in order to account for the cases wherein the NAIS is not implemented, is implemented only for beef and is implemented for beef and pork. The differences in the estimated total revenues for each scenario are used as a gross measure of the NAIS benefit for each type of meat. The main conclusion is that the gains for the beef and pork sectors would be capable of covering the costs of the NAIS implementation. However, this result depends on how much of these potential gains will arrive at primary producers.

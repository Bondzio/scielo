This paper addresses the anthropogenic pressures on water bodies and their relationship with the environmental services associated with these environments, taking as an example the reality observed in one of the largest urban fragments of natural forest in the world, the Cantareira State Park. It discusses the relationship between anthropogenic pressure and the socioeconomic status of the population surrounding this conservation unit occupied by Atlantic Forest. Furthermore, it calls attention to the fact that the protection of vegetation does not always result in the protection of aquatic habitats and water quality, harming the use of environmental services that are legally allowed.

This paper focuses on the relationship between the three spheres of power - Union, State and County/Municipalities - proposed in 2007 by the Ministry of Education in its Education Development Plan. The aim of this plan is to improve the quality of basic school education. We start by listing some advance and developments in the relationship maintained among the various governmental spheres that have taken place in the last decades. These should lead to the construction of the National System of Education. Emphasis is given to some challenges generated by the Union's participation in local agreements in order to increase quality's standards, indicating, also, possible ways of regulating such agreements. The definition of parameters for institutionalizing the regime of collaboration and social control of education on a national level is perceived as bound to transform basic school education into the main axis of a project of Nation.

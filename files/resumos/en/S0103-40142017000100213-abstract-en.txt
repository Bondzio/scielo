Abstract This article addresses energy transition from the perspective of the decentralization of energy management. Broadly speaking, this transformation may be related to diversification of the energy matrix and to empowerment of the various social players and of state and local governments in urban energy management and planning, from projects for energy conservation and efficiency in every industry to greater government transparency and population engagement in urban planning. In light of the international experience in decentralized energy management, this paper analyzes the possibilities of its implementation in Brazilian cities.

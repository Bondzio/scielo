Abstract: There were major changes in household demand for meat in Brazil in recent years, such as the increasing importance of processed cuts. It is well known that changes in meat consumption may significantly affect household nutritional status and consequently people&#8217;s health and life quality. Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze the demand for meat from Brazilian families and understand the pattern of substitution between beef, pork and broiler as well as within these subgroups. Data was obtained from the Brazilian Household Consumption Survey (POF/IBGE 2008/2009). Demand patterns for meats that emerge from this study showed the importance of education, family composition and household location on determinants of meats acquisition. We also conclude that there is a changing trend of intra-group consumption in the case of chicken meat, a behavior that is not observed for pork and beef, where the intra-group exchange takes place only if the meat is considered to have good quality.

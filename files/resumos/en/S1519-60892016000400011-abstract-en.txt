Abstract The paper presents a critical analysis of the institution of hired domestic care in the context of global capitalism. The author starts with outlining the context of late modern society in the European and Anglo-American regions in which global inequalities and intensive enlargement of capitalism bolster a market model of care and consequently also the institution of hired domestic care which increasingly involves migrants. From the perspective of Critical theory she analyses the possible variations of relationships between domestic worker and employer within the institution of hired domestic care. And she concludes that the institution of hired domestic care necessarily involves social bias which reproduces social inequalities as well as traditional gendered division of labour and institutionalised servitude.

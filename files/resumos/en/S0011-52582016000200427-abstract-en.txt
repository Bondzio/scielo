ABSTRACT Civil-military relations in Portugal are analyzed employing a framework with empirical indicators focusing on the three dimensions of democratic civilian control, effectiveness in roles and missions, and efficiency. Despite the economic crisis, and consequent lack of government resources, this analysis of Portugal is positive in comparative perspective. In addition to the influence and incentives of international organizations, specifically NATO, EU, and the UN, the author emphasizes how civilians and military use defense policy and the armed forces in pursuing strategic goals.

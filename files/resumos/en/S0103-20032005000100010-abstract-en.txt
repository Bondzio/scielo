Agricultural activities have historically had great importance in the Economy, and within such context the environment was relegated to secondary importance. Major impacts occurred in environmental degradation terms, leading to the question about which effects towns would have withstood and which similar characteristics are among them. This study attempted to quantify the environmental degradation level of Minas Gerais State's towns. Specifically, a multivariate analysis attempted to determine such economic, population and biological indicators causing environmental degradation; next, to quantify the degradation in those cities and, finally, to group them according to their similarities. The results showed an average degradation indicator (ID) of 86% for Minas Gerais State; it should be pointed out that more than 40% of those cities had ID values equal to 1. Additionally, other index values were shown above 0.70 that means 70% of the area degraded. The exceptions were the cities of Senator Amaral and Bom Repouso with minimum IDs of 0.04 and 0.10, respectively.

It was from my Master's thesis that I became interested in the intersections between environmental thought and feminist theorizations. The Conference on pos and decolonial feminisms in Buenos Aires (2010 y 2012), organized by the program "Postcoloniality, border and cross-border thinking in feminist studies" (IDAES-UNSAM), provided an ideal setting for these discussions. This essay is a first attempt to address, from a feminist perspective, current socioenvironmental fights on land, territory and the model of development that take place in the Province of Chubut.

Abstract The purpose of this article is to analyze the field of I&amp;P in Brazil. To do so, we gathered 526 papers presented in 11 events of sociology, political science and communication carried out from 2000 to 2014. The methodology was based on a content analysis in order to map the main authors, research centers, political and technological objects, theoretical approaches, methods, techniques and areas covered by the submitted papers. On the one hand, the results indicate numerous concentrations and disparities regarding authors, institutions and regions involved in the research. On the other hand, there is evidence of further consolidation and maturation of the area, which is focused on objects that are more specific and features a growth of empirical studies. At the end, we argue that I&amp;P seems more an interdisciplinary thematic than an actual research field.

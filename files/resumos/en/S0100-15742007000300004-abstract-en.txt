The aim of this paper is to discuss the problems related to the reconciliation of work and family responsibilities in the recent process of family structure and labor market transformation in Brazil. Based on data from the National Sample Household Survey of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, it outlines the changes in Brazilian family and participation of women in the labor market according to family composition. Our main purpose is to show that the poor development of public services, which would allow the socialization of family care costs, is harmful to the female participation, in the labor market, on a qualitative and quantitative basis.

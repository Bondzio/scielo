Abstract: This article proposes a reflection on the web of meanings that intertwine Pedro Almod√≥var's The Skin I Live In (2011) plot - these are often contradictory meanings that illuminate the shadow zones in which thought thematizes difference. First, we analyze the explicit discourse of the film, which deals with the plasticity of the body and the fluidity of genre, showing its constructive character when it dissociates itself from fixed and essentialist categorizations. Next, his implicit discourse is analyzed, considering that every film, as a product of social practices, is also constituted by a set of ideas that escape the author's own intentions. Ultimately, it is a matter of thinking to what extent the implicit discourse of the plot constitutes a kind of counter discourse in relation to what the feature film explicitly proclaims.

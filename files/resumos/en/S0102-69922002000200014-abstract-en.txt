Video has not already found a good place in the field of methodology of Social Sciences. His language is different both from the oral and of writing form of expression, because it is a specific system of signs. This technique must find its own data rules, its own categories of analysis and meaning. Its must break the evidence of reality. If the sociologist wants to show his research, he must accept the rules of media and produce an adequate video. For that, the knowledge of Semiology and of Palo Alto College is really important to know. For that, the audio-visual methodology is surely useful to bust forward the sociological practice. From his own shots and videos the author indicates how tree categories of social experience are used by audio-visual methodology: the body in "The domestic work", the space in "The ordinary management of life cut in two", and the learning of social time in family life, during the prime socialisation.

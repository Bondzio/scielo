The article analyses the Michael Löwy&#8217;s work upon the concept of &#8220;elective affinity&#8221; used by Max Weber. We draw upon Löwy&#8217;s articles presenting his attempt to build an effective contribution to a more clear definition and use of the concept. The article points out some of the arguments put forward by his critics displaying what would be Löwy&#8217;s formulation limits. As an introduction we present the sociological context of the most famous appearance of the concept in the Max Weber&#8217;s book The protestant ethics and the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of capitalism which has been serving for Löwy&#8217;s research and developments.

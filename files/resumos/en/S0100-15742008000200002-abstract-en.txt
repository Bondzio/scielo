This article intends to explain a new concept which appears in the National Education Guidelines and Framework Law: basic education. As this is a conceptually new term among terms which are not so new, it needs to be understood within a new framework of references. Besides this dimension, basic education is also a right and a new way of organizing the Brazilian education. As a concept, it helps to understand the reality in which it is inserted and that presents itself under new basis. As such, it also means foundation and a path to be followed. As a right, it imposes itself as an extension of the spectrum of educational citizenship. Finally, as a new organization, it encompasses three phases: early childhood education, compulsory primary education and progressively compulsory secondary education. Such phases are made up of a unique, diverse and progressive reality. This article discusses the meaning of this new conceptual configuration, its origin in the Federal Constitution of 1988 and its consequences for the organization of the Brazilian education.

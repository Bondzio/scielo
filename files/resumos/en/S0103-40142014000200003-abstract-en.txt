This article discusses the hypothesis that Brazil is facing a second great transformation of labor in the early 21st century. Great transformation is understood as the current structure of the labor market, with an increasing number of formal wage earners and falling unemployment, income inequality and poverty. This movement differs from the first major transformation of labor (1930s to 1980s), when the country pursued an important consolidation of urban and industrial society. Having been stopped in the tracks in the last two decades of the 20th century by economic and social regression, Brazil only now begins to give signs of a second transformation of labor, established in new foundations, through the strengthening of the service sector - which, incidentally, still awaits the State to reposition itself in terms of public policies.

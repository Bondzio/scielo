Abstract: This paper presents an overview of recent and old debates on the literature created in Soviet concentration camp complexes (gulags), and examines books, conferences, research institutions and memory organizations dedicated to the matter. The article concludes with the observation that studies on the distinctiveness of Gulag literature are still scarce.

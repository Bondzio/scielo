Abstract This research analyses practices of justice regarding domestic violence in 5 special courts in Brasilia, DF. Focusing on perceptions of justice held by the parties, we look at differences of procedure followed by the respective courts when applying the law. Analyzing judicial processes and court hearings, the research points out key elements that interfere in the procedures for handling cases, far beyond what is prescribed by law (Lei Maria da Penha). Special attention is given to the so called &#8220;conditional suspension&#8221; of the process. The results indicate, on the one hand, differences and similarities in the legal interpretation of the nature of conflicts and, on the other hand, they also show the limitations of legislative initiative for changing legal practices on this issue.

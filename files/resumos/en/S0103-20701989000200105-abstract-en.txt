The paper intends primarily to discuss the relationship, similarities and differences between state planning and public policies, two notions which, in Brazil, are commonly referred to the same empirical universe. Furthermore, by stressing the theoretical inadequacy of any attempt to establish rigid distinctions between &#8220;economic&#8221; and &#8220;social&#8221; aspects in government action, the paper sugests that it is necessary to revise such a division, also pointing to the need for further analysis on the very notion of social policy which, to say the least, is a very controversial one. Then, on the basis of post 1964 government programs, it tries to evaluate Brazil&#8217;s social policies, viewed as the central but inoperative core of government activities in this area. Finally, special emphasis is given to the discussion of national health policies in Brazil.

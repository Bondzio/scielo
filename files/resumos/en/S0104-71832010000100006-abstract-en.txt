Roger Bastide is usually considered as an anthropologist of religions. Nevertheless, a pattern for the analysis of lifestyles can be found in his works. In his book Les Am√©riques Noires, he describes social conflicts over the definition and the appropriation of legitimate cultural goods and practices that follow the end of slavery in Brazil. He focuses on three social facts: horse riding, pastorals and carnival. Bastide's works stress the logic of distinction that leads to the existence of different lifestyles. They work as a magnifying glass that helps us understand the functioning of our own societies.

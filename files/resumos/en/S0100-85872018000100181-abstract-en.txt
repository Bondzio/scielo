Abstract The aim of this article is to systematize several researches that have analyzed the links between education and religion. Some of this studies refer to intergenerational transmission; others focus on religious schools; and the last ones explore the relations between religious groups, churches, and the laicism in the scholar system. For this systematization, we will base on the literature available in the disciplines interested in studying these fields, even if they do not explicitly propose to analyze their links, primarily considering research in anthropology, but also in other social sciences. We will reconstruct the fundamental themes which are addressed in research, as a way to carry out a framework of analysis as a starting reference in any investigation concerned about educational processes, and religious formative experiences of children.

The paper analyzes the organization of organic farmers from Andalusia who were involved in an attempt to establish a participatory system of guarantee. This initiative was spearheaded by the autonomic administration between 2006 and 2008. The study is based on interviews with social actors who were involved in this process, identifying political and organizational barriers which have prevented this proposal to move forward.

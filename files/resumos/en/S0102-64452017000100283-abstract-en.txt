Abstract This article resumes the creation story of the SuperintendÃªncia para o Desenvolvimento do Nordeste (Sudene) in 1959, since its early years until the military coup in 1964. Therefore, it is relevant to highlight the trajectories of two characters in this process: Celso Furtado and Francisco de Oliveira. The first one was a well-known established economist at the time. He conceived and presented the Sudene's project to President Juscelino Kubitschek, who gave him the task of managing the new entity. The second one, a young sociologist from Recife, came to the Sudene as a member of the first workgroup and shortly later became Furtado's substitute. Throughout the text, we demonstrate how this brief and intense experience - sharply interrupted in 1964 - became remarkable in the trajectories of these two important Brazilian intellectuals of the 20th century.

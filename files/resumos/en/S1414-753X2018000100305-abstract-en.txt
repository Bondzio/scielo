Abstract The 1990s highlighted the creation of new business dynamics focused on environmental responsibility.

As a result, sustainable technologies and practices became part of the management strategies of many companies and new legal obligations and business incentive programs have arisen.

By means of questionnaires answered by hotel owners/managers and guests, the study assessed environmental management in hotels using a sustainability index. The overall level of sustainability in hotel management in Jo√£o Pessoa, Brazil was considered intermediary and guests&#8217; requirements regarding environmental matters were high.

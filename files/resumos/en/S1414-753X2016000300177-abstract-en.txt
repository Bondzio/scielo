Abstract Through the time, tourism has suffered changes in its different ways of migration. In the past century, in the 1970's, a new type of tourism strengthened, mainly in Spain, which was named tourism of second homes. In Brazil, associated with traditional tourism, this residential tourism was consolidated in the Northeast Coast, from the 1990's, giving rise to the tourist real estate complex. In this context, this research aimed at mapping these tourist real estate complex and discussing about evidences of this model in that region. Data were collected through a field and documental research. From this study, it was verified that more than 50% of those of the 53 identified tourist real estate complex belong to foreigner groups, where many of them were embargoed, not finished or are even being built. It was concluded that every Brazilian northeast State has at least one mega project of this type operating, being concluded or designed, in contrast to the environmental discourse of these projects, besides the social segregation and appropriation of space, typical from this kind of activity.

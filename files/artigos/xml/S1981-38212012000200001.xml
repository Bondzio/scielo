They are usually perceived as opposite, rival approaches. In the field of democracy    there is a seemingly insurmountable rift around the question of political <i>versus</i>    economic democracy.

Liberals    say that economic democracy is too abstract and fuzzy a concept, therefore one    should concentrate on the workings of an objective political democracy.

Both have been very fruitful in illuminating a wide range of common issues across    these fields and yet are usually perceived as opposite, rival approaches contradicting    each other in general. The fall of the Soviet Union and the socialist countries    in Eastern Europe obliged Marxist and liberal theorists to make further efforts    to understand this process - the former to comprehend the crumbling of communism,    the latter interested in the political and economic transition to capitalism.    Due to the circumstances surrounding these developments - seemingly the complete    victory of one side over the other - the common task to analyze the perestroika    and transition experience did not lead to a coming closer of the two contending    views, but may have even led to a deepening of the gulf between them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This article argues that liberalism and Marxism    are extremely useful approaches and are not mutually exclusive. I propose some    first steps towards a synthesis between them exactly in relation to one of their    greatest bones of contention - the issue of democracy. No grand synthesis will    be offered here, but rather the humble beginning of an effort to bring the more    moderate contenders from each side to utilize some of their specific insights    to co-jointly better illuminate this complex matter. In practice, I will propose    the creation of a new, alternative index for measuring democracy, which incorporates    liberal and Marxist insights and can therefore be more acceptable to <i>both</i>    sides than the presently existing ones. It is my hope that if we can create    an index that is acceptable to both sides, this may lead to joint collaborative    research which will deepen our present understanding of democracy and of the    difficulties it still faces in being fully accepted in many parts of the world.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The article is composed of three sections - a    presentation of how the problem of democracy historically arose between liberalism    and Marxism; the proposal of a preliminary synthesis of the Marxist and liberal    views via the creation of a joint index of democracy which incorporates insights    from both camps; and an initial application of this index to the transition    countries of Eastern Europe.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since we will focus on the experience of transition    countries, we will start by describing the definitions of democracy used in    the studies of transition.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Concept of Democracy in Transition Studies</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The concept of democracy arose a long time ago    and has been a highly controversial one, but the version used by most mainstream    political scientists (especially transitologists) has its roots in Joseph Schumpeter's    (1984, 336) famous minimalist definition of democracy as "that institutional    arrangement for arriving at political decisions in which individuals acquire    the power to decide by means of a competitive struggle for the people's vote."    In other words, democracy is characterized by the existence of <i>competitive</i>    elections for the executive and legislative posts instead of them being filled    by means of hereditary succession, violent revolutionary means, etc. According    to Schumpeter, this is a <i>descriptive</i> definition, <i>i.e.</i>, one that    describes in an objective manner what modern democracies are like, thus avoiding    subjective, normative definitions which prescribe what an ideal democracy should    be like according to each author's worldview. As Samuel Huntington puts it:</font></p>     <blockquote><font face="Verdana" size="2"> In his path-breaking study, <i>Capitalism,    Socialism and Democracy</i>, Schumpeter spelled out the deficiencies of what    he termed the "classical theory of democracy", which defined democracy in terms    of "the will of the people" (source) and "the common good" (purpose) &#91;...&#93;</font>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> For some while after World War II a debate      went on between those determined, in the classical vein, to define democracy      by source or purpose and the growing number of theorists adhering to a procedural      concept of democracy in the Schumpeterian mode. By the 1970's the debate was      over and Schumpeter had won. Theorists increasingly drew distinctions between      rationalistic, utopian, idealistic definitions of democracy, on one hand,      and empirical, descriptive, institutional and procedural definitions, on the      other, and concluded that only the latter types of definition provided the      analytical precision and empirical referents that make the concept a useful      one. Sweeping discussions of democracy in terms of normative theory sharply      declined, at least in American scholarly discussions, and were replaced by      efforts to understand the nature of democratic institutions, how they function,      and the reasons why they develop and collapse (Huntington 1991, 6-7).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus, Schumpeter's minimalist concept of democracy    lies at the base of current mainstream Western political science. It is especially    influential in the field of study of democratic transitions (Huntington 1991,    7; O'Donnell and Schmitter 1988, 26; Przeworski 1991, 10; Przeworski et al.    1997, 114; Schmitter &amp; Karl 1996, 50). Definitions of democracy used in    the study of countries in democratic transition are "Schumpeter's heirs" in    the sense that they owe greatly to that Austrian thinker. Especially if we take    into consideration O'Donnel's warning about the "not-so-minimalist" character    of Schumpeter's definition,<a name="tx1" href="#nt1"><sup>1</sup></a> we must    acknowledge that most definitions presently used reveal themselves as more or    less sophisticated variations of the Schumpeterian original matrix. For example,</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>democracy is</i>...</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#91;...&#93; a regime in which government      posts are filled by means of competitive elections. A regime is democratic      only if the opposition &#91;can&#93; compete for, win and take charge of these      posts (Przeworski et al. 1997, 131).</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#91;A political system in which&#93; the most      powerful decision makers are elected through fair, honest and periodic elections      in which candidates freely compete for votes and in which virtually all the      adult population is eligible to vote (Huntington 1991, 7).</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#91;...&#93; a system of governance in which      rulers are held accountable for their actions in the public realm by citizens,      acting indirectly through the competition and cooperation of their elected      representatives (Schmitter &amp; Karl 1996, 50).</font></p>       ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#91;...&#93; a system of government that meets      three essential conditions: meaningful and extensive <i>competition</i> among      individuals and organized groups (especially political parties) for all effective      positions of government power, at regular intervals and excluding the use      of force; a highly inclusive level of <i>political participation</i> in the      selection of leaders and policies, at least through regular and fair elections,      such that no major (adult) social group is excluded; and a level of <i>civil      and political liberties</i> - freedom of expression, freedom of the press,      freedom to form and join organizations - sufficient to ensure the integrity      of political competition and participation (Diamond et al. 1989, xvi).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These are some of the most important theorists    of democratic transition and consolidation processes in the world today. Their    definitions, from the first two more minimalist to the last more elaborated    one, like Schumpeter's, place democracy's greatest emphasis on the method of    choosing the rulers (and the possibility of becoming a ruler oneself), emphasizing    that elections must be "clean" and "competitive", which pre-supposes a series    of civil and political liberties.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Schumpeter's concept of democracy has been criticized    from different points of view (<i>e.g.</i>, Held 1987, 178-85), but I herein    want to draw attention to one specific facet of the problem. Procedural (descriptive)    definitions of democracy of the Schumpeterian type turn liberal, representative    democracy into the <i>only</i> possible type of real democracy. In it, the main    political role of the great mass of the population is to elect (and kick out),    with great freedom and in a competitive way, those special citizens who will    represent them in the executive and legislative branches of government. According    to Schumpeter's intellectual heirs, historical experience has shown that it    was with this model of political organization that modern societies have reached    the greatest degree of freedom for their citizens. However, the elevation of    liberal, representative democracy to the status of <i>sole</i> valid paradigm    brings with it contradictions with definitions of democracy, based on its historical    and etymological origins. Let us examine this in greater detail.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>The Origins of Democracy</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Etymologically speaking, the word democracy comes    from the Greek <i>demokratia</i> (<i>demos</i>, "people", <i>kratia</i> linked    to <i>Kratos</i>, "force", "power" and <i>kratein</i>, "rule", "govern") meaning    "power of the people", "rule of the people". It referred to the government system    of Athens in the 5<sup>th</sup> century BC. In Athens every (male adult) citizen    could himself vote in the Assembly (<i>eklesia</i>) on the most important questions    of the city. Apart from the <i>eklesia</i> - which met at least ten times a    year - Athenian citizens elected a council (<i>boule</i>) made up of 500 people    who exercised executive power, running daily business, putting into practice    the decisions of the Assembly, preparing the agenda of its future meetings,    etc. The members were elected for a one-year period. This Council was divided    into committees of 50 members, each committee governing for a period of one    tenth of the year. Since nobody was allowed to remain on the Council of 500    for more than two years, ordinary citizens had a good opportunity to serve on    it at some point in their lives. Rotation in government posts was considered    a good method to escape the formation of oligarchies and ensure participation.    Athenian "politicians" in general were then not professionals but amateurs.<a name="tx2" href="#nt2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus, in its Greek origins, democracy was <i>direct</i>,    <i>i.e.</i>, the citizens voted personally and directly in the Assembly and    the executive power of the Council of 500 was not exercised by a separate class    of politicians but rather by the citizens themselves in alternation. Democracy    was a new form of government in which the citizenry as a whole could exert power,    in opposition to the previous regimes of monarchy/tyranny (one-man rule) or    aristocracy/oligarchy (rule of the few). The will of the majority of citizens    ought to be the basis for the final decisions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The main point, as far as our discussion is concerned,    is that democracy, in its origins, was basically <i>direct</i> (no "middleman").    It is important to emphasize this fact because, after its heyday in Athens,    democracy went through a centuries-long eclipse. Except for a few isolated cases,    democracy reappeared as a political regime only after the "democratizing shock"    by the French Revolution (1789) and the American War of Independence (1775-1781)    on the principles of political liberalism originated in the English Glorious    Revolution (1689). Liberalism in its 17th-century beginnings was an elitist    doctrine. It was only after the democratizing shock of the French and American    Revolutions that liberalism started vigorously expanding the suffrage to wider    parts of the population, thus starting to form what we now call <i>liberal democracy</i>.    The goal of a liberal democracy was to allow participation of greater portions    of the population as <i>electors</i> and <i>potential candidates</i> (for government    posts), at the same time trying to keep the public and private spheres separate,    restraining government so that it would not become tyrannical over the individual.    Thus, liberal democracy became an <i>indirect</i> democracy. Due to the excessively    large size of the new nation-states, it was not any more possible for the people    to directly exert power in Greek <i>eklesia</i>-like assemblies and therefore    it became necessary that citizens elect representatives to a smaller Parliament,    which would then take the proper final decisions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Direct and Indirect Democracy - Controversies</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When we say that current "Schumpeterian" concepts    of democracy emphasize the competitive election of rulers we notice that this    view "freezes", and turns into a paradigm the representative (indirect) type    of democracy. Moreover it elevates to a pedestal exactly what Rousseau (and    also, from another angle, the defenders of direct democracy) considered the    one thing capable of emptying out the very essence of democracy: the election    of autonomous "representatives" of the citizens who legislate <i>au lieu</i>    of them. For Rousseau, people's sovereignty is non-transferable; either people    exert it directly or it does not exist. Therefore his ironical comment on the    "liberal" political system of Britain in the 18th century: Sovereignty cannot    be represented for the same reason that it cannot be alienated &#91;...&#93;    The deputies of the people, therefore, are not and cannot be their representatives;    they can only be their commissioners, and as such are not qualified to conclude    anything definitely. No act of theirs can be a law, unless it has been ratified    by the people in person; and without that ratification nothing is a law. The    people of England deceive themselves when they fancy they are free; they are    so, in fact, only during the election of members of parliament; for, as soon    as a new one is elected, they are again in chains, and are nothing (Rousseau    1947, 85).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In modern jargon, Rousseau at best accepted what    we call the <i>imperative mandate</i> for deputies, by which these merely fulfill    pre-arranged orders from the voters. But he would never accept the autonomy    of those elected deputies, for it would be a form of alienating sovereignty,    and sovereignty, according to him, is inalienable.<a name="tx3" href="#nt3"><sup>3</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus, we notice that definitions of a Schumpeterian    kind, which make legislative representation (under liberal conditions) synonymous    with democracy, find themselves in conflict with some currents of "classical"    democracy, which view sovereignty as emanating directly from the people and    inseparable from it in the act of law-making. We also saw that the conception    of democracy of the ancient Greeks emphasized the citizens voting their laws    directly in the Assembly (<i>eklesia</i>) while the executive power was vested    in a rotating collective body of citizens, the Council of 500 (<i>boule</i>).    According to this model, democracy should literally mean "the government of    the people",<a name="tx4" href="#nt4"><sup>4</sup></a> as indicated in the etymological    roots of the word. It is necessary to draw attention to the fact that Schumpeterian-type    definitions of democracy do not easily fit together with either the etymological    or historical roots of the concept. On the contrary, they go against the essence    of the original model of democracy when they (according to Rousseau) take away    sovereignty (<i>i.e., </i>the power to rule or legislate over oneself) from    the people and transfer it to a chosen few.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These observations can be viewed as petty nostalgia    for some forgotten, golden past in which, due to the limited size of the city-states,    direct democracy was possible. However, the question is more complicated. The    central problem is as follows. If democracy is really to be a "government of    the people" and we accept the impossibility of having direct democracy in present-day    large nation-states,<a name="tx5" href="#nt5"><sup>5</sup></a> then the only    way to have a true representative democracy would be to make certain that Parliament    and government (<i>i.e</i>., the elected body) reflected exactly (or very closely)    the proportions of preferences of the body of electors. If this condition is    not realized, then we do not have a democracy but, at best, a mixed type of    government with elements of aristocracy. Moreover, even if Parliament reflects    "the people", in real life a problem frequently arises which we may call parliamentary    "refraction", <i>i.e.</i>, the disassociation of the interests of electors and    the elected once the electoral campaign is over and real legislative activity    begins.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Those who attentively observe the political scene    in different countries notice that the above-mentioned <i>refractive phenomenon</i>    indeed occurs and often the elected do not reflect the wishes (or even the ultimate    interests) of the electors once they are well established in the "House of the    People". This is not a problem according to Schumpeter's definition because    he does not stipulate an imperative mandate for the deputies, but rather the    utmost freedom for the elected politicians to pursue their causes according    to their personal conscience. Like James Madison (1999, 160-167) in <i>Federalist    Paper No. 10</i>, Schumpeter thinks that an elite of capable parliamentarians    chosen from among the best options by the people will be in better condition    to discuss and decide about the complex political issues than the general mass    of people as a whole, the majority of whom do not have the technical skills    or knowledge to best tackle these questions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If in Schumpeterian democracy the political role    of the people is basically to elect (and kick out) a governing elite, we come    to the following dilemma. Doesn't changing the focus of democracy from searching    for the best way for the people to self-govern and placing it on the institutionalization    of a method of inclusive formation of autonomous political elites mean to abandon    the very essence of democratization?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Schumpeter's attempt at creating a "descriptive"    definition of modern democracy comes up against epistemological difficulties.    Would it not be a tautology to define democracy by the mere description of the    regimes considered democratic? How could Schumpeter know that these regimes    were really democratic if he did not have an <i>a priori</i> definition of democracy?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These represent a group of problems regarding    the Schumpeterian view of democracy on an abstract, theoretical plane. However,    even if we disregard these issues stemming from the point of view of direct    democracy, there is still another problem with the conception of democracy of    the present "heirs of Schumpeter", namely the unresolved question of the interaction    between political and economic democracy. And that is the great bone of contention    with Marxists.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>The Socialist Objections</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even not taking into account some considerations    which would be essential to the more literal defenders of direct democracy (such    as the difficulty in achieving a faithful proportional representation of the    electorate in Parliament, the problem of the divergence of opinions and positions    of the electors and the elected in the post-election period, the Rousseauian    problem of alienation of sovereignty, etc.), there is still a basic objection    put forth by socialists in the 19th century which has not yet been adequately    answered: the objection that political democracy without economic democracy    is insufficient to qualify a society as fully democratic.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most forceful formulation of this objection    was Lenin's famous diatribe in <i>The State and Revolution</i>:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In capitalist society, under the conditions      most favourable to its development, we have a more or less complete democracy      in the democratic republic. But this democracy is always bound in by the narrow      framework of capitalist exploitation, and consequently always remains, in      reality, a democracy for the minority, only for the possessing classes, only      for the rich. Freedom in capitalist society always remains just about the      same as it was in the ancient Greek republics: freedom for the slave-owners      &#91;...&#93;</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Marx splendidly grasped this <i>essence</i>      of capitalist democracy when, in analyzing the experience of the &#91;Paris&#93;      Commune, he said that the oppressed were allowed, once every few years, to      decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class should be      in parliament to represent and repress them! (Lenin 1943, 71-73)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the passage above, Lenin puts forth a series    of questions that reflect the socialist criticism of the insufficiencies of    political democracy unaccompanied by economic democracy. How can one believe    that the "vote" ( = the power to elect) of a slum dweller has the same weight    as that of, say, Ted Turner, who owns influential media? "One person, one vote"    is the basic principle of all definitions of democracy above. But if the real    voting power (<i>i.e.</i>, the real capacity to "make" rulers) of citizens vary    according to their wealth, their access to or domination of the means of communication,    then can it be considered a real democracy?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The question of the control of the means of communication    is especially crucial because the capacity of the citizen-owners of the big    media to influence the rest of the citizenry makes their "vote" (their real    capacity to influence policies) much greater than average.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, the socialist criticism of bourgeois    democracy goes deeper than that. It says that capitalist society is <i>inherently</i>    undemocratic because if the means of production are concentrated in the hands    of a minority class, and not socialized throughout the population, these unequal    conditions will influence the strictly political field as well. Socialists ask    why bourgeois democrats demand equality in the political field only. What is    the reason for not expanding equality into the economic field as well? Liberal    political scientists restrict democratic equality to the political sphere, refusing    to expand it to the economic field. As two famous transitologists put it in    an influential work:</font></p>     <blockquote><font face="Verdana" size="2"> The advent of political democracy is    the preferred <i>terminus ad quem</i> of our interpretative effort, but it is    not the end of struggles over the form and purpose of politics &#91;...&#93;    In a sense, the transition to political democracy sets up the possibility -    but by no means, the inevitability - of another transition.</font>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#91;...&#93; We have called this "second"      transition "socialization" &#91;...&#93; In this context, all we can do is      reaffirm our earlier presumption that political democracy <i>per se</i> is      a goal worthy of attainment, even at the expense of forgoing alternative paths      that would seem to promise more immediate returns in terms of socialization      (O'Donnell and Schmitter 1988, 30-33).</font></p> </blockquote>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This passage is emblematic because it highlights    the dilemma of the gulf between the two positions. For liberals, political democracy    is an end in itself, independently of economic democratization. On the other    hand, the socialist/Marxist critics state that without economic democracy bourgeois    political democracy is insufficient.<a name="tx6" href="#nt6"><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>The Marxist/Liberal Divide</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Where do we stand on this issue? At present we    find this deadlock: liberals refuse to leave the safe haven of political democracy    and extend their reach to economic democracy; revolutionary Marxists dwell on    economic democracy and refuse to go without it to political democracy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to cross the sea that separates these    two continents, I propose the following research agenda: is it possible to come    up with a "unified field" theory of democracy? In other words, is it possible    to create a method that simultaneously evaluates (measures) the advances (and    setbacks) in the fields of political democracy <i>and</i> economic democracy?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The possibility (or functionality) of such unified    theory is denied by both the liberal and the Marxist sides. The post-Schumpeterian    liberals say that the inclusion of economic democracy would be a complicating,    highly subjective extra factor, which would undermine the concision, precision,    functionality and objectivity typical of today's minimalist, procedural definitions    of democracy (Huntington 1991, 9; Mainwaring et al. 2001, 651). On the other    hand, radical Marxists, in the footsteps of Lenin (1943, 71-73), affirm that    liberal democracy "is always bound by the narrow framework of capitalist exploitation,    and consequently always remains, in reality, a democracy for the minority, only    for the possessing classes" and that a real <i>government of the people</i>    may only develop in a society in which the means of production are socialized    - therefore, it is a useless pastime to measure &#91;the illusion of&#93; political    democracy in capitalist countries. As we see, one side refuses to measure the    level of economic democracy and the other side of political democracy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We must admit that the search for this "unified    field" democratic theory is very difficult. The spheres of political democracy    and economic democracy seem so qualitatively different that the possibility    of a joint measurement may turn out to be a Herculean, even Sisyphean task.    However, this is a necessary effort for the sake of objective research on democratization.    Take the case of two democratizing regions, for instance, Latin America and    Eastern Europe. Some transitologists have written sophisticated work comparing    the democratization efforts in these two regions (Przeworski 1991; Nelson 1994;    Greskovits 1998). If in the analysis of the "South", a minimalist, Schumpeterian    approach to democracy (centered on the political side) is facilitated by the    fact that the economic basis in the region (capitalism) is the same before and    after the transition (thus justifying the concentration on the political aspect),    the same does not hold true for the "East". In the former socialist countries    of Eastern Europe, the economic base changed completely from the beginning of    transition (socialism) to the end (capitalism). In this case, it is difficult    not to take into account the consequences of the transformation on the economic    side (<i>i.e.</i>, also measure the changes in economic democracy). Due to the    structural differences in the original modes of production these regions started    off from, the comparative evaluation of the gains and losses the populations    in the "South" and the "East" had with these transformations (and also the comparisons    between capitalism and socialism in general) are in need of a synthetic breakthrough    in the field of evaluation of political and economic democracy. Such a breakthrough    might allow a common language for Marxist and non-Marxist political scientists    in their analyses of the transformations of the former socialist countries in    general.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A first, prosaic step in this direction could    be the establishment of an extra item in rankings like those of Freedom House    (the organization that evaluates quantitatively the level of political democracy    in the countries of the world). Besides measuring political democracy, I would    propose that we also measure economic democracy (<i>i.e.</i>, the degree of    equal access of citizens to the means of production and wealth of the nation)    by using the provisional proxy of the Gini coefficient.<a name="tx7" href="#nt7"><sup>7</sup></a>    In order to avoid the trappings of using a more sophisticated, subjective measurement    of economic democracy, which might reduce its concision, simplicity and functionality,    the use of the Gini coefficient, which measures the degree of income inequality,    may be a good provisional operational proxy and may allow Marxists and liberals    to start using the common language of numbers as a modest beginning towards    greater future understanding around this hypothetically enlarged ranking of    democracy of the new Freedom House of the future.<a name="tx8" href="#nt8"><sup>8</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>The New Joint Index of Political and Economic    Democracy</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As we saw, the main difficulty in bringing together    liberals and Marxists in creating a common measurement of democracy is that    liberals say that economic democracy, unlike political democracy in its minimalist    definition, is too abstract a concept to be quantified and operationalized,    whereas Marxists refuse to take into account political democracy without economic    democracy. Therefore, if we could find a quantifiable and functional index for    economic democracy, this could be a great step forward. Since economic democracy    is really an abstract and controversial concept - for example, a completely    state-owned economy would signify that everybody has control of the means of    production or that nobody has control of them? - we proposed a proxy, which    is the Gini coefficient of income differentials. As mentioned earlier, the fact    that the Gini coefficient does not relate directly to the ownership of the means    of production, it may even turn out to be an asset. It creates a "healthy" competition    for which system or regime, <i>in practice</i>, shows better distributive justice,    regardless of the form of ownership of the means of production. Of course, the    Gini coefficient is far from a perfect index, even in its own terms, but it    may be regarded as a valid, provisional (until a better indicator is found)    first step towards an attempt to jointly measure political and economic democracy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the purpose of presenting an illustration    of how this index can be built we propose the following exercise. For economic    democracy we will use the Gini coefficient of different countries as presented    in the World Income Inequality Database of the United Nations University (2005)    and in the TransMONEE (2006) database of the Innocenti Research Center of UNICEF.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our index for political democracy will be the    arithmetic mean between the scores of political rights and civil liberties assigned    by Freedom House to each country every year.<a name="tx9" href="#nt9"><sup>9</sup></a>    In order to make our indicators for Economic Democracy and Political Democracy    comparable, we will present both of them in a scale from zero to ten, with zero    being the worst score (<i>i.e.</i>, least equal or least democratic) and ten    the best score (the most equal or the most democratic). Finally, our joint index    of political <i>and</i> economic democracy will be the arithmetic mean between    these two indicators on the scale from zero to ten. The result is shown in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a01tab1.jpg">Table 1</a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What the new index tells us</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The table with the new index was designed to    measure the difference the populations of the transition countries experienced    between the end period of the former socialist regime and recent years in terms    of economic democracy, political democracy and both simultaneously. Let us analyze    them separately.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All countries in this survey had a drop in their    level of economic democracy. Their income inequality (as measured by the Gini    coefficient) worsened - in some nations more than others. The greatest decrease    in income equality was in the Russian Federation (from 7.3 to 5.1 = -2.2), Armenia    (from 7.5 to 5.4 = -2.1), Azerbaijan (from 6.9 to 4.9 = -2.0), Georgia (from    7.2 to 5.5 = -1.7) and Moldova (from 7.5 to 5.8 = -1.7). The ones that had the    smallest falls in the item Economic Democracy were Belarus (from 7.7 to 7.5    = -0.2), the Czech Republic (from 8.0 to 7.6 = -0.4), Hungary (from 7.8 to 7.3    = -0.5) and Lithuania (from 7.4 to 6.9 = -0.5).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In terms of political democracy, the worst performers    in this period were: Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (both from 2.5 to zero = -2.5);    Belarus (from 2.5 to 0.8 = -1.7); and Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and    the Russian Federation (all four having in 2006 the same level of PD &#91;<i>i.e</i>.,    2.5&#93; as in 1989). The largest advancement in political democracy as compared    to 1989 went to Bulgaria (from 0 to 9.2 = +9.2), the Czech Republic (from 1.7    to 10 = +8.3), the Slovak Republic (from 1.7 to 10 = +8.3) and Romania (from    0 to 8.3 = +8.3).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If we take the combined index of political <i>and</i>    economic democracy, the greatest improvements also go to Bulgaria (from 3.9    to 7.8 = +3.9), the Czech Republic (from 4.9 to 8.8 = +3.9), the Slovak Republic    (from 4.9 to 8.1 = +3.2), and Romania (from 3.8 to 7.0 = +3.2). The greatest    falls in the joint index were those of Azerbaijan (from 4.7 to 3.7 = -1.0),    Belarus (from 5.1 to 4.2 = -0.9), the Russian Federation (from 4.9 to 4.3 =    - 0.6) and the Kyrgyz Republic (from 4.9 to 4.4 = -0.5).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The figures above show a diversity of outcomes    in the transformative processes of each country. Some nations were clearly more    successful than others in different areas. The main advantage of an index that    shows both political and economic democracy, rather than only political democracy,    is that it reveals that both areas have to be taken into consideration if we    want to understand the full impact of the transformations on the populations    and how they react to it. Although certain countries have made great gains (especially    in terms of political democracy), all of them worsened their economic democracy.    This may be at the heart of a malaise captured in opinion polls in these countries    which demonstrate a degree of dissatisfaction within the present regimes (and    sometimes even a certain nostalgia for former times among some groups of the    population) which is not congruent with the improvements since the last decade    (Levada 2000; Polit.ru 2002). This new index brings to light and to the public    debate the question of economic democracy, without which the transformations    of the past years cannot be fully understood.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since the purpose of this article is to introduce    the new triple index in general, we will not analyze in details the implications    of the above figures for each country. We will just point out that the table    presented could be analyzed in myriad ways: the individual characteristics of    the most successful and least successful countries; the development paths apparently    more conducive to higher scores in the three areas; how much of the present    absolute situation in the three areas is due to legacies from the socialist    past and how much is due to the transition itself, etc. Does the index show    that there are paths more conducive to both political and economic democracy?    Or are the paths to political and economic democracy separate? All these fields    of research are extremely rich and will certainly bring new insights. Hopefully    the new triple index can spur this kind of research from both liberals and Marxists    in fruitful dialogue.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Difficulties and Possible Variations in the    Use of the New Index</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even if one accepts the idea of measuring economic    democracy alongside political democracy (which is the main point of this article),    there may be interesting debates on how to best use the new index.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the specific case of the comparative table    on the transition countries, one could debate whether the most appropriate approach    is to compare the present situation with that of the last years of their respective    perestroikas. Some might argue that it would be better to compare the present    with the pre-1985 situation (or with the average of the scores of all years    of perestroika) since these times were more typical of the socialist experience.    All three alternatives have reasonable arguments behind them and would yield    different outcomes. For most countries, the gains in political democracy would    be greater, and so would the steepness of the fall in economic democracy as    our comparisons go further back in time because the socialist regimes then were    both more authoritarian and egalitarian. Also, depending on the time each country    began to liberalize, the apparent gains in political democracy may seem greater    or lesser as a consequence of the base year utilized. In sum, it would bring    a healthy and fruitful debate to explore all scenarios possible with the triple    index and analyze what results the different comparisons yield.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The main questions I want to highlight here,    however, are the ones concerning the joint index <i>per se</i>, independently    of the group of countries under analysis. I have already pointed out why I consider    the Gini coefficient of income differentials an appropriate rough, initial and    provisional proxy for economic democracy (until we construct a better indicator).    Although it is not directly related to the form of ownership of the means of    production (as some Marxists would probably prefer), it captures the allocative    result of the <i>use</i> of the means of production, which is actually the gist    of the matter as far as the general population is concerned.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other main objection to using the Gini coefficient    would be the problem of comparability. As with almost all cross-national economic    indicators, the Gini coefficient raises issues of comparability. Conceptual    application and survey methods may vary in different countries, or according    to source, contaminating the comparison. There are two solutions to this problem.    The most immediate is to carefully examine the survey methodologies and utilize    in the comparison the surveys that use similar approaches. Secondly, the very    development of the field and utilization of such indicators lead to the standardization    of procedures and therefore ever-increasing comparability. For example, for    many OECD countries the standardization of statistics, as embodied in the work    of the Luxembourg Income Study group, is already a reality.<a name="tx10" href="#nt10"><sup>10</sup></a>    Hopefully, widening the use of the Gini coefficient in other areas will help    spur the ongoing efforts towards ever-greater standardization in cross-national    statistics. As we mentioned, the Gini coefficient is a provisional <i>proxy</i>    for the initial quantitative incorporation of the economic aspect into the debate    on democracy. Its use can be either perfected or substituted as we progress    along this previously uncharted road.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the present demonstration, we directly drew    upon the Freedom House scores to designate the level of political democracy    of each country. Improvement can also be made to this category. The Freedom    House rankings have been criticized in different aspects (especially for a certain    degree of ideological bias) and attention to some of these criticisms may improve    their methodology. One aspect which I deem technically important would be to    promote a change in the scale of their scores (at present from 7 to 1, being    1 the most free and 7 the least free). This creates a crowding in the upper    end of the scale with the result that Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, etc. are considered    to have achieved the same level of political democracy (=1, or the maximum)    as, for instance, Denmark or Sweden. It would be better to have a more open-ended    scale, like the Gini coefficient, for example, where the supreme score (denoting    perfect equality) is not achievable in practice by any country, so that it better    differentiates between the front runners.<a name="tx11" href="#nt11"><sup>11</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One objection my joint index may receive is that    using an arithmetic mean between the political democracy and economic democracy    indicators is a too simplistic way to measure two qualitatively different magnitudes.    My answer to this is threefold. Firstly, the arithmetic mean (instead of some    more sophisticated weighted average) expresses the belief that <i>both</i> political    and economic democracies are equally important. Secondly, simplicity and concision    (in a word, minimalism) have revealed themselves important to break through    complex epistemological barriers in the past. Schumpeter's minimalist definition    of democracy (deemed too simplistic at first by some authors) is one of such    cases. Finally, I would like to reiterate that my triple index is an initial    attempt to develop a joint indicator of political and economic democracy by    means of a minimalist approach (until we are able to later develop a more sophisticated    indicator).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I believe my proposed triple indicator stands    more reasonably half-way as a "give-and-take" compromise between the Marxist    and liberal positions than the other indexes available in our present literature.    The Freedom House scores, the Polity Project's democracy and autocracy scales,    the Vanhanen polyarchy dataset, and the Coppedge-Reinicke polyarchy scale concentrate    on political democracy. Marxists object to this exclusivity and also to the    existing indexes of economic freedom, like the Heritage Foundation's Index of    Economic Freedom, the EBRD's Transition Indicators, and the Cumulative Liberalization    Index by the World Bank's de Melo et al. (1996), which, according to them, measure    basically the freedom to pursue business. On the other hand, efforts by Marxist    or social-democracy oriented sociologists to operationalize concepts closer    to economic democracy such as, for example, the erstwhile burgeoning literature    on workplace democracy and workers' control of past decades remained overall    normative and descriptive. As such, they failed to produce a quantifiable index    which could satisfy the operational requirements of liberal institutionalist    political scientists.<a name="tx12" href="#nt12"><sup>12</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All these remarks are for the future. This article    will have achieved its objective if it can convince some liberals and some Marxists    of the necessity to evaluate and measure both political and economic democracy.    It proposes one possible way to do that.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If this challenge is taken on, even if Marxists    and liberals work separately, very interesting comparative work can be done    in the near future. For instance, to investigate the levels of political and    economic democracy of the countries before and after the third wave of democratization;    compare the transitions in Eastern Europe and in Latin America; analyze the    current transformations in Asian countries, etc.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, the greatest results would be obtained    if Marxists and liberals abandon the zero-sum game attitude between them and    engage in a constructive dialogue whereby the purpose is not to "defeat" the    opponent, but through discussion reach superior insights, combining the best    of each position. My hope is that the use of objective, measurable yardsticks    as a means to judge political and economic democracy may be the beginning of    an effort to bring the more moderate contenders from both sides to establish    a meaningful, unprejudiced discussion of democracy. Historical experience has    shown that neither the state nor the market alone can adequately manage the    development of modern societies. The Post-World War II decades and the experience    of the welfare state have shown that it is possible to simultaneously increase    economic efficiency and social justice. This <i>Weltanschauung</i> suffered    setbacks in the decades of the eighties and the nineties when the radical separation    between market and state was again postulated. Thus, attempts to make a dialectical    synthesis of the two apparent opposites, Marxism and liberalism, become important    not only in theoretical, but also in practical terms. It is necessary to recover    the notion that state and market, social justice and efficiency, economic and    political democracy are not opposites <i>per se</i> and can come together in    a more harmonious manner.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, is it too utopian to imagine that maybe    a Hegelian synthesis between the camps of Marxism and liberalism will in the    future be reached and in the historical practice eventually a society will emerge    possessing both political and economic democracy to the highest degrees?</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Blumberg, Paul. 1968. <i>Industrial Democracy:    The Sociology of Participation</i>.

The adjective <i>comparative</i> has crucial significance.    If the democratic method is basically the <i>competitive</i> struggle for the    people's vote, in order for this struggle to proceed properly a series of pre-conditions    must be present. Among them, Schumpeter (1984, 338, 341) himself lists the freedom    of the press and of discussion, without which there can be no "free competition    for the free vote".    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<br>   <a name="nt2" href="#tx2">2</a> The exception was the ten generals elected every    year to command the army and the navy. They could be reelected indefinitely.    Pericles, for example, was reelected for 30 years (Brinton et al., 1965, 26-27).    <br>   <a name="nt3" href="#tx3">3</a> Although he did not put things in these terms,    it is important to notice that Rousseau is not particularly in favor of direct    democracy in the <i>executive</i> branch of power. Sovereignty<i>, i.e</i>.,    the power to rule (legislate) over oneself, refers, in his view, to the legislative    branch. Laws must be ratified directly by the people. Now, the executive power<i>,    i.e</i>., the more mechanical or formal aspect of merely carrying out these    laws (wishes) of the people, can be entrusted to some persons who will faithfully    carry it out. There is a certain analogy here with the post-independence U.S.A.,    in which some Founding Fathers had the idea that the legislative branch of government    would be the powerful one, with the executive branch merely "executing" the    orders (laws) of Congress.    <br>   <a name="nt4" href="#tx4">4</a> People understood as citizens.    <br>   <a name="nt5" href="#tx5">5</a> The question of whether or not direct democracy    is possible in present-day large nation-states is controversial. It is frequently    pointed out that once home computers (or, at least, access to computers) become    universalized (like radio and TV in the past) the technical difficulties to    carry out nationwide simultaneous computerized voting are actually not big.    If Brazil (a "third world" country) can conduct completely computerized voting    for executive and legislative posts (with near real-time result announcement)    every two years, why could it not conduct every four or six months universal    voting or ratification of laws by the whole population? Also important in this    regard is to notice that in March 2007 Estonia became the world's first country    where internet voting was allowed in a national election.    <br>   As the argument of technical difficulties for direct democracy seems to dwindle    with the possibilities of electronic voting, we are faced with the evidence    that the main obstacles for direct democracy are not of a technical nature,    but of a political nature, such as expounded by James Madison in <i>Federalist    Paper No. 10</i> (echoing some arguments against democracy already put forth    by Aristotle and Plato).    <br>   <a name="nt6" href="#tx6">6</a> Cf. Norberto Bobbio's (1983, 33-34) famous assessment:    "If the historical experience has shown us that so far no socialist system created    by means of non-democratic methods (<i>i.e</i>., by revolution or conquest)    could become democratic, it has also shown us that capitalist systems cannot    become socialist democratically &#91;...&#93; In capitalist states, the democratic    method, even in its best formats, closes the road to socialism; in socialist    states, the concentration of power from a unified controlling center of the    economy makes extremely difficult the introduction of the democratic method".    <br>   <a name="nt7" href="#tx7">7</a> In income terms, economic inequality is measured    by means of the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient varies from <i>zero</i>    (= absolute equality) to <i>one</i> (= one persons owns all the wealth of a    country). Historically the Gini coefficient varied from around 0.2 in more egalitarian    socialist countries of Eastern Europe before perestroika (<i>e.g., </i>Czechoslovakia,    Hungary) to around 0.6 in extremely inegalitarian countries, like Brazil and    Guatemala. The average of the OECD countries is around 0.3 (World Bank 2002;    Cloutier 2007).    <br>   <a name="nt8" href="#tx8">8</a> The provisional utilization of the Gini coefficient    as a rough, initial proxy for the level of economic democracy may also bypass    the possible barrier of a criticism often leveled at the Marxist defense of    the collective property of the means of production as more democratic than private    property. Many non-Marxist economists say that the end goal of production is    <i>consumption</i> and that, since state socialist property is administered    inefficiently, most of the population will have a higher standard of living    if factories and other units of production are privatized and more efficiently    run. Then, via taxation, the larger income may be redistributed to the population    (the Keynesian welfare state model). In other words, with a privatized, but    better run, economy most of the population will have a higher standard of living    (via redistribution of income by means of taxation) than in a society where    the means of production are socialized, but ill administered. This was the <i>ratio    decidendi</i> behind the privatization processes in Eastern Europe. The utilization    of the Gini coefficient has the side (beneficial) effect of covering this reasoning,    since it measures economic democracy on the output side, <i>i.e</i>., according    to income or wealth produced, not according to the mere possession of means    of production.    <br>   <a name="nt9" href="#tx9">9</a> See the Freedom House website at <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org" target="_blank">http://www.freedomhouse.org</a>.    <br>   <a name="nt10" href="#tx10">10</a> See Luxembourg Income Study website at <a href="http://www.lisproject.org/" target="_blank">http://www.lisproject.org</a>.    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<br>   <a name="nt11" href="#tx11">11</a> Theoretically, the supreme score of such    a Gini coefficient-like scale of political democracy would be the level achieved    by a society with <i>direct</i>, free democracy and fully universal suffrage.    The closer a society (by different mechanisms, including indirect representation)    comes to this (in historical practice so far unreachable) ideal, the more democratic    it would be. See the discussion on the historical roots of direct democracy    at the beginning of the article in order to understand the logic of this reasoning.    <br>   <a name="nt12" href="#tx12">12</a> For the indexes mentioned, see the Freedom    House website at <a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org" target="_blank">http://www.freedomhouse.org</a>;    Polity IV Project website at <a href="http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/polity" target="_blank">http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/polity</a>;    Vanhanen's Polyarchy dataset at <a href="http://www.svt.ntnu.no/iss/data/Vanhanen" target="_blank">http://www.svt.ntnu.no/iss/data/Vanhanen</a>;    Coppedge &amp; Reinicke 1990; Index of Economic Freedom website at <a href="http://www.heritage.org/index" target="_blank">http://www.heritage.org/index</a>;    Transition Report (various years) at <a href="http://www.ebrd.com" target="_blank">http://www.ebrd.com</a>    and Melo et al., 1996.

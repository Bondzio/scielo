AbstractIn this work I interpret some narratives about the first nighttime venues meant for or occupied by homosexuals or entendidos in Goiânia, capital of Goiás. The accounts show the role of these establishments in the formation of friendship networks, sociability or of a certain homosexual scene in the city between the 1970s and 1980s. On the other hand, they lead to a preliminary discussion about the relationships and tensions between memory, homosexuality, prejudice and resistance.

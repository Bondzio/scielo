After its inception in the 1960's and until the economic turn of the 1980's, the cutural policy has completed a cycle of increasing debasement. However, at the same time, this evolution has also entailed an important enhancement of the local cultural policy. Afterwards, this trend has been even more exacerbated by the entrepreneurial turn of the urban policy, which has turned culture into a central element of the new strategies of territorial development. Thanks to this impulse, a new model of cultural policy is lately taking shape in the local sphere substituting the declining classical paradigm of cultural policy of national scope. The article shows the logic of this substitution process and examines, in particular, the cultural policy recreation process in the local sphere. This analysis focuses on the case of Barcelona, which is an exemplary case in the this regard.

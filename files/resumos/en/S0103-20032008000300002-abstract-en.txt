This work studies the wage differentials and determinants of the employees in Brazilian agriculture, in period 1981-2005, on the basis of the information of the National Research for Sample of Domiciles of the IBGE. The methodology of Heckman is used to correct bias of selection, common in wage equations gotten by Least Ordinary Square, besides the decomposition of Oaxaca-Blinder, to analyze the wage differentials between 1981 and 2005. Between wage determinants, had been analyzed: education, experience, region, weekly working time and formal work, besides some macroeconomic determinants. The results of the work suggest a reduction of the wage differentials, mainly in the end of the studied period, and that the variable education, age and formal work had contributed to reduce the wage differentials between 1981 and 2005; and on the other hand, the variable geographic region and weekly working time, had contributed to increase them. Moreover, the macroeconomic variables included in the analysis were statistical significant in the explanation of the agricultural differentials.

Abstract This article reflects on the therapeutic culture that Brazilian anonymous support groups produce &#8211; especially in MADA (Women Who Love Too Much Anonymous) &#8211; and on contemporary feminist strategies and forms of action in digital networks, as pedagogical instances of emotional learning and social (re)organization of romantic suffering. In this way, I attempt to understand how accounts about love and romantic suffering offer modes of action, systems of communication, and exchanges between these domains.

This work is based on the second session report concerning feminist publications hosted at Non-Governmental Organizations, which took place during the I Brazilian Meeting of Feminists Publications. Through resulting contributions, this article is intended to characterize the scenario, pointing out to common aspects they may have, including difficulties and possibilities. Moreover, it comprises a brief analysis of electronic texts (articles, files, brochures...) available on the organization's sites. The scenario, though promising, unveils weaknesses that need to be considered not to jeopardize the editorial projects objectives here described.

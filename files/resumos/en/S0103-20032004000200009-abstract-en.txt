The present article intend to present a criterion for implantation of technologies destined to desalinated the drinking waters reservoirs that provide the cities of the state of Cear√° affected by high levels of salt. Considering the hypothesis, demonstrated in this article, that there is a strong correlation between the socioeconomics conditions and the level of salt of the water that supplies the population of the cities, a socioeconomic criterion was chosen.

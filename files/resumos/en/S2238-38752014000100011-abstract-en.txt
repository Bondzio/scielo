Abstract The interview focuses on aspects of the intellectual life of David Harvey. Rebuilding his journey from the early years at Cambridge University, where he graduated, passing by theoretical dialogues with names like Henry Lefebvre, it highlights the centrality of the issue of space in his works, his proposal for reconstruction of concepts from Marxism and the public character of his intellectual practice.

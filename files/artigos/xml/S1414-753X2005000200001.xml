In the spirit of Mitchell (1990) we can see IWRM as a multi-layered  systems approach to water management, integrating</font></p>    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.  Relations between surface and groundwater, quantity and quality</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.  Relations between water and land use (environment)</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.  Relations between water and stakeholder interests</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4.  Relations between water-related institutions</font></p></blockquote>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While  combining these four seems a perfectly logical way forward for a water sector  in need of modernisation, they bring a surfeit of challenges, and require a radical  change in the culture of water management. After all, IWRM, notoriously difficult  to model, is not just the sum total of all the isolated facets of water management  - it requires a totally different, de-compartmentalised institutional set-up.  Boundaries between use, functions, disciplines, experts and lay people need to  be torn down, while administrative boundaries must give way to unified management  at catchment (or wetland) level. Much actual IWRM planning therefore remains at  Level 2 (integrating land and water).</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In  the current policy discourse, however, the philosophy of involving multiple stakeholder  groups in resource management seems unstoppable. The UNCED World Summit in Rio  de Janeiro, 1992, kicked off the development by making express reference to the  need for policymakers to consult nine &acute;major groups .<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a>  This provided a spur for numerous Local Agenda 21 initiatives in Brazil and around  the world. While water management did not yet feature so prominently in the Rio  principles, dialogue and co-management increasingly found their way into the management  of common-pool resources (CPRs) like coastal management, fisheries and forestry  - that latter sector especially giving rise to a productive and critical literature  on the topic of Multi-Stakeholder Platforms (e.g. EDWARDS &amp; WOLLENBERG, 2002).  In the water sector, too, Multi-Stakeholder Platforms (also known as Fora, Dialogues,  Partnerships and <i>Mesas de Concertaci&oacute;n</i>) as currently widely promoted  as an institutional setting for participatory water management, attract considerable  support base from almost all quarters - policymakers, donors, NGOs, water managers  and water supply companies. International donors like Canadian IDRC and Dutch  SNV promote local multi-stakeholder processes, and multilateral organisations  (World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank) push for participation to forestall  conflict over infra-structural projects - or to pick up the pieces after it (as  a conditionality to secure further loans), in the case of Cochabamba&acute;s &acute;water  war&acute; of 2000 (WARNER, 2004).</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both  IWRM and MSP are ways of managing increasing degrees of variety (diversity) and  variability (dynamics) (s. KOOIMAN, 2000). This diversity of perceptions, the  argument runs, is likely to bring a multitude of overlooked aspects to the table,  which, in turn, is hoped to hold the key to more integrated and sustainable outcomes.  Once people see the sense of involving multiple voices, it is felt, they will  be broadly accepted as the way forward in dealing with the increasing complexity,  diversity and dynamics of water management.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From  a functionalist perspective, MSPs are perceived as problem-solving institutional  innovations, to democratise water management, to manage conflict, even to make  water management more efficient (see WARNER, forthcoming, for an inventory of  these rationales). But what is actually going on, and how do we approach our research  and analysis? What are we actually talking about? While obviously an increasingly  popular pet, MSP as newly emerging social life form still requires proper determination.  Setting out to study Multi-Stakeholder Platforms, we are not looking into a phenomenon  with clear prior definitions. Like the elusive 'regimes', in vogue in the 1980s  in the discipline of International Relations, they are not necessarily 'things  out there', institutions with offices, bye-laws and secretariats, but inferred  patterns of behaviour and interaction, singled out of a complex reality and labelled  'MSP' because having this class of constellations seems to add to our understanding  of reality.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  present article conceptualises and typifies the multitude of organisms that fall  under the rubric of multi-stakeholder platforms. It starts by unpacking the concept  of MSPs, and the degree of power sharing they facilitate. It provides a preliminary  typology of MSPs in terms of degree of influence. The last section will discuss  the issue of in- and (self-)exclusion of actors.</font></p>    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>2.  UNPACKING MSPS</b></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  motives for studying a phenomenon like MSPs are multiple, and seem to be related  to different actors' social agendas.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First,  multi-stakeholder dialogue is a New Thing, a novelty that did not catch various  researchers' eye - which is not to say that it had not existed before: impelled  by necessity people start to interact with groups they didn't interact with before.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second,  these researchers are joined by those who pick the theme and catchphrase up. They  look at existing and past cases and wonder if the label doesn't stick there, too.  Aren't the venerable Dutch non-governmental water management boards, where farmers  have come together for centuries to regulate the water levels a kind of MSPs?  Aren't Zimbabwean Catchment Councils MSPs (MANZUNGU, 2001)? This approach broadens  the appeal, but at the same time runs the risk of stretching the definition beyond  its limits. MSP definitions tend to come from the prescriptive rather than descriptive  end - the ideal-type MSP is imbued with a very positive value connotation. Because  of characteristics attributed to them - diversity, democracy, learning - MSPs  are deemed a Good Thing, a model to be strived after. This leads to conflicting  definitions and classifications of what real (<i>proper</i>) MSPs are, an issue  Warner and Verhallen (2005) have tried to tackle elsewhere.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third,  as the label starts capturing the imagination as an attractor in a value field,  actors and institutions may start to attach the label to themselves or their initiatives,  whether or not they actually conform to the analytical definition. As a topic  becomes 'hot', it attracts all kinds of initiatives and research into everything  Mullti-Stakeholder-related.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But  what actually <b>makes</b> a multi-stakeholder platform? A widely accepted definition  defines a platform as a 'decision-making body (voluntary or statutory) comprising  different stakeholders who perceive the same resource management problem, realise  their interdependence for solving it, and come together to agree on action strategies  for solving the problem' (STEINS &amp; EDWARDS, 1998). It is like a roundtable,  where people are gathered with very different perspectives. When people come together  in platforms, they have multi-stakeholder dialogues. A multi-stakeholder dialogue  is not just a conversation, but an interactive approach to getting things done  - 'a contrived situation in which a set of more or less interdependent stakeholders  in a resource are identified and invited to meet and interact in a forum for conflict  resolution, negotiation, social learning and collective decision-making towards  concerted action' (R&Ouml;LING &amp; WOODHILL, 2001).</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  word 'Multi-Stakeholder Platforms' is a compound of three defining elements -  multi, stakeholder and platform. Out of these three, <b>'stakeholder'</b> itself  is of recent vintage. In issues of corporate governance, it is increasingly realised  that apart from the (often short-term) interests of shareholders, other interests  such as employees, suppliers, the community and the environment should be taken  into account if the company is to be legitimate and sustainable. Giddens (1998),  head of the London School of Economics and one of the <i>auctores intellectualis</i>  of New Labour, coined the 'stakeholder society' as a way nations should be governed.  Society is thus represented as an enterprise, with all the risk-taking, profit  and loss that involves, rather than a secure living environment.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stakeholders,  then, are individuals, groups or institutions that are concerned with, or have  an interest in the water resources and their management. They include all those  who affect and/or are affected by the policies, decisions, and actions of the  system. That means not only direct water users but those affected by (waste)water  management. They include those involved in water resource development, management  and planning, including public-sector agencies, private-sector organisations and  NGOs and external (such as donor) agencies.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  <b>'multi'</b> in MSP does not refer to 'multiple stakes' on the part of one person  or group (although they may well be present - as well as single stakeholders wearing  multiple hats), but to the diversity of identities of stakeholders. The 'multi'  is contrasted with 'single-sector' forms of interaction such as practiced in Participatory  Irrigation Management (PIM). PIM is nominally concerned with agriculture, not  fisheries, industry, navigation, urban water uses - although PIM may indeed seek  to represent different interests within <i>agriculture</i> - high-, mid- and lowland  farmers, or smallholders and <i>latifundistas</i>, or allocate special voice to  the traditionally disenfranchised such as landless or women.</font></p>    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps  because of this agricultural origin, stakeholders still tend to be solely defined  in terms of economic identity groups (<a href="http://www.earthsummit2002.org/wausus/mtingrports/s9/s9.htm" target="_blank">www.earthsummit2002.org/wausus/mtingrports/s9/s9.htm</a>),  while in cases of multi-ethnicity or multiple language identities or religions  (Belgium, Canada, Canada, Lebanon) it would make sense to assign stakeholdership  to cultural, religious or other identities where these identities are salient,  in the tradition of 'consociationalism' , which tries to explain how democratic  stability is possible in culturally segmented political systems. as a way of accommodating  social conflict (LIJPHART, 1969).</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One  key driver for participation is the <u>salience</u> of the water issue. When the  management challenge is immediate and urgent, such as flood risk in a threatened  area, social pressure for all to participate will be high, especially where interdependence  between social actors is obvious. In the Netherlands, to name one example where  just over half the country is below sea level, even the non-participation of a  single smallholder could upset the communal system for dike raising and maintenance.  This power of obstruction made the voice of minorities a force to be reckoned  with.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In  terms of number, we obviously expect more than two interests to be represented  to deserve the 'multi' prefix, but often there are more criteria. A very rough  measure of the 'multi'-inclusiveness of MSPs is whether state, civil-society,  and private-sector actors are represented. In terms of the vertical dimension,  it also makes sense for different levels of government to be represented (e.g.  local government and state government) as both impact on the catchment's management,  at the strategic and operational level. In water management, the co-ordination  between these groups often turns out disastrous (HILHORST, 2003; WARNER, HILHORST  &amp; WAALEWIJN, 2003), most recently evidenced in the response to the hurricane  Katrina in New Orleans. However, if this means that three minority interests at  three levels getting together equals an MSP, perhaps our thinking is on the wrong  track. We have to look at actor relevance and roles within the network comprising  MSPs as well. It depends on the local situation who the relevant stakeholders  are. According to Paul Engel (pers. comm.), relevant actors are those that 'just  won't go away'. That is a very pragmatic understanding of 'relevant' but, as we  shall see, it obscures at least two categories: the dominant ones, who may feel  they have nothing to gain from participation, and unaware actors, who do not know  what there is to gain. In terms of relevance, Gavin and Pinder (2001) usefully  identify primary and secondary stakeholders. Primary stakeholders are those who  are ultimately affected, i.e. who expect to benefit from or be adversely affected  by the intervention; secondary stakeholders: those with some intermediary role,  bringing or testing knowledge or carrying mediation and facilitation skills. Note  however that even with the best of intentions, it may not be possible for the  facilitator to avoid power-play due to structural power differences making themselves  fall within and/or outside the platform.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These  differences point at a lack of a 'level playing the field', which is relevant  for the third element in MSP, a 'platform', as a forum for negotiation, which  suggests a raised and level surface. Raised, to be able to step out of sectoral  issues and take a more broad overview of the issues, while the raised surface  also connotes the conspicuous nature of MSPs, which act in the public space and  are therefore open to public scrutiny. Level, in the sense that the stakeholders  (ideally) have (or come to a situation of) equal rights and power balance (DEN  HOND, 2003). The assumption of a level playing field is one of the most conspicuous  flaws in MSP thinking given the obvious power gaps, or indeed politics, between  the participating actors (HEMMATI, 2002).</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If  not directly given a seat by the facilitators or according to the bye-laws of  the platform, non-represented interests may find their way through co-opting formally  sanctioned identities where the platform's bye-laws provide strict barriers to  (later) entry. For example, barriers to entry to the Dutch waterschappen (water  management boards) are high - it would take a statutory change to allow a seat  for a new stakeholder group - which forces environmental groups to co-opt one  of the incumbent stakeholder groups. But barriers may be more subtle: as Warner  &amp; Simpungwe (2003) have noted on the basis of Simpungwe's experience with  South African MSPs, platforms are unlikely to remain captivating to the rural  poor when the meetings are held in urban block offices with lots of people in  suits toting laptops, or when the local language is not understood. Physical and  cultural accessibility of the participatory process is therefore graded.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A  second meaning of 'platform' (a raised surface) is more appealing: it connotes  the conspicuous nature of MSPs, which act in the public space and are therefore  open to public scrutiny. This is however not always in conformity with reality.  In developing policy, stakeholders may be sworn to secrecy to promote the confidentiality  for actors to start exchanging information and making deals with each other. Not  everyone respects that code, however - we found instances of leaked information,  to stakeholder constituencies or to the press.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What's  in a name? MSPs as networks</b></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  name 'Multi-stakeholder platforms' has proved to be a mildly controversial one.  The 'stakeholder' metaphor connotes that stakes can be actively raised or withdrawn,  which many in society cannot. Some NGO speakers therefore would prefer other neologisms  such as 'stakegainers' and 'stakelosers'. We will maintain the suggestion, implicit  in the word, of getting or holding on to access to the actual water resource or  service and shall assume that <i>actors</i> develop intentional <i>strategies</i>  to do so. A stakeholder, then, is someone who has got something to lose (or win)  with respect to a scarce resource.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We  also gleaned from discussions with Indian researchers that <i>platforms</i> seem  to have an unwelcome connotation in India, just like <i>mesas de concertaci&oacute;n</i>,  for historic reasons don't always have a good ring in Latin America. R&ouml;ling  himself is not much using the term he coined any more, preferring 'Multi-Stakeholder  Processes'. Fortunately our focus is wide enough to allow for multi-stakeholder  'processes','partnerships', 'dialogues', 'fora', 'roundtables' and other such  beasts. In fact, in the course of our research, we have become more and more convinced  that what we are in fact researching are <b><i>networks</i></b> rather than actual  platforms, which suggests physically fixed space with an organisational structure  and secretariat.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Platforms  and networks are both metaphors. Platforms suggest a form of institutionalisation  networks do not. Network management suggests shifting alliances, not necessarily  tied to one place, or it could also be only a meeting of the stakeholders where  the basin's polycentric management is being discussed (cf. SCHLAGER &amp; BLOMQUIST,  1998). The Yakunchik platform in Ayacucho, Per&uacute; is more like a heterarchical  'phone circle', a group of people who are in touch with each other but do not  actually have a secretariat and an office (see TYPE 1, below). Likewise the Indian  Sabermati Forum (TYPE 3) rarely meets as a platform, but functions as a facilitating  network.</font></p>    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In  this respect the term 'Network management' has its merits. Let us briefly look  into the scholarship on the concept. A concept rising in the late 1990s (and made  famous in the academic world by the hefty tomes published by MANUEL CASTELLS from  1996) ideally provides a middle ground between hierarchical order and heterarchical  chaos, state and market, the rigidity of the 'one best way' and unmanageable freedom,  monoculture and variety as complexity theory has it: the most stable point for  navigation is the edge of chaos. The multi-stakeholder platform combines these  elements as it allows for greater variety and flexibility than a pyramidal organisation.  Horizontal meets vertical in a structured way, as seats are allocated to groups,  but membership - entry and exit - is open.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In  a network, problem-solving capacity is dispersed. Network management is suitable  in a mixed-motive situation: where actors involved are facing both cooperative  (interdependency) and confrontational stimuli. Network management in the conception  of a group of Dutch public administration scholars (e.g. KICKERT, 1993) is seen  as a form of coordination of strategies of actors with different goals with regard  to a certain problem or policy measure within an existing framework of inter-organizational  relations. Network management takes place in a context without clear goals, without  clear management hierarchy and without clear decision procedures on which to rely.  Thus network management can be considered a 'weak' form of steering or at least  as a form of steering in which uncertainties are 'built in'.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Network  management can be judged by the extent to which it enhances the conditions for  'favourable' interaction and the degree to which the network supports these processes.  Based on the idea that <i>networks are often characterized by co-operation</i>  and co-ordination problems caused by the lack of a dominant decision centre, network  management is considered a success if it promotes cooperation between actors.  In multi-stakeholder platforms, power is - ideally - dispersed in such a way that  no actor dominates, and its management is not monopolised by a single actor. The  degree of structure they possess can range from highly organised to a free-ranging  social group, a kind of 'phone circle' as in 'Type 1'below.</font></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>3.  NEGOTIATION OR SOCIAL LEARNING THROUGH DIALOGUE?</b></font></p>    <p align="right"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>'Since  dialogue is our only hope, it must work' (R&Ouml;LING &amp; WOODHILL, 2001)</i></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having  re-conceptualised platforms as networks, let us now turn to what MSPs are for.  The writings on MSPs come from very different world views - one in which people  change things by learning together (what I call 'cognitive school'), and one in  which things only change by changing the power balance (the 'realist school').  In other words: while much of the literature concentrates on multi-stakeholder  processes for social learning, others see them primarily as spaces for negotiation.  These views are most clearly expressed in the view of cooperation and conflict.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As  Glasbergen (1995) notes, networks are a logical outcome when both collaborative  and cooperative pulls are encountered. Each of the schools of thought emphasises  one of the extremes on this continuum. Aarts &amp; van Woerkum (2000) contrast  two types of negotiation - distributive and integrative negotiation. Distributive  negotiation is antagonistic, interest-based, mainly concerns the cutting of the  cake, actors keep their cards close to their chests. A <i>conflict</i> framework  sees negotiations as zero-sum with winners and losers. A co-operation approach  sees &acute;win-win&acute; outcomes. It stresses the interest representation aspect  and the need to redress power differences (e.g. BOELENS, 2002). The approach is  reflected in the MSP-as-alliance we shall encounter later as &acute;Type 5&acute;.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Integrative  negotiation, on the other hand, starts from a commonly perceived challenge, involves  'baking the cake together', and involves joint social learning. On the co-operation  side, the cognitive school is interested in whether joint gains can be obtained  through learning in the face of uncertainty, information gaps and low trust. Where,  say, rich white farmers and poor black smallholders in South Africa are not talking  to each other and both are wary of central government, gathering these interests  round the table and negotiate common problems and getting them to put themselves  in each other's shoes, a joint learning process may take place. This makes the  democratic form reflected in MSPs 'deliberative' in nature rather than a simple  majority vote (WARNER &amp; SIMPUNGWE, 2003). Just like integrated management  is a great leap forward from aspect management, learning together constitutes  a great leap forward from one-way extension of (agricultural) practices.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  &acute;cognitive&acute; strand, concerned with deliberation and learning, has  been especially fruitful in the area of agricultural extension, where it was realised  more and more that one-way communication was less and less acceptable to the targeted  groups - they had views and knowledge too with which the training on offer was  not necessarily compatible. This led to new models for two-way dialogue, soon  expanded to a multi-directional (roundtable) model. The CIS group at Wageningen  University benefited from soft-systems theory (CHECKLAND &amp; HOLWELL, 1998)  in dealing with the complexity that arises when you want to have multiple-way  deliberation instead of one-way extension. Each stakeholder or stakeholder group  can be expected to have different interests concerning the use and management  of a natural resource, and different perceptions. However, due to the existing  information gaps, rather than just bargaining on the basis of these interests,  this school feels that, given the proper facilitative conditions, it may also  be possible to get people to change their problem definitions. In a situation  of complexity, actors are advised to leave their sectorial perspective behind  to develop a shared perspective in a process of 'reframing' policy problems (GRAY,  1997). This requires skilful facilitation - if badly done, a reframing process  can of course result in a totally expedient 'vision' with a high deal of equifinality  (a condition in which different initial conditions lead to similar effects), without  addressing the actual dilemmas. The important skill is to bring the dilemmas,  the conflicts, out into the open and discuss about them. A good facilitator puts  sufficient time into divergence before aiming for convergence. In fact, it may  not be possible to converge and it may be necessary for all to accept a hard-won  compromise. But that openness and responsiveness require a great deal of social  trust, something that for example in Peru, as in many other locations elsewhere,  is still developing. Thus, any 'repair' means a combination of conflict, negotiation  and, where possible, consensus-seeking. The effect of multi-stakeholder participation,  then, is not to depoliticise issues (quite the contrary), but to expand the legitimacy  base beyond government, beyond 'the experts'.</font></p>    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  'cognitive school' of MSP, then, sees facilitated social learning as a helpful  modality enabling new forms of governance. Our research however encountered serious  problems with the cognitive approach.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Platforms  can help a better <i>spread</i> of ideas (within the platform and inside-out).  Communication may be a vehicle for information/knowledge exchange, knowledge building  and dissemination. Free-riding, opportunism and double agendas however are obvious  pitfalls. While there are known cases where the stakeholders themselves collect,  manage and interpret the information, it is hard to predict and prove however  that any joint learning (rather than individual learning, or learning at delegation  level) happens as a result of participation. While no doubt people learn by doing,  i.e. acquire new information and ways of thinking due to their participation,  we find that the &acute;social&acute;, mutual, collaborative aspect, is not necessarily  happening. The critical condition here is not only the recognition of interdependence,  but also the willingness of all that involves taking joint <i>responsibility</i>  and learning their way into addressing the issue facing all. Negotiation that  looked integrative may turn out to be distributive after all. For example, in  the Nete basin (Flanders), where the Ministry for the Environment selected and  invited 13 stakeholder categories to help develop a river vision, we found several  actors listening in, but not really contributing. Some actors subscribed to the  participation process as such, but also worked around the platform, for example  mobilising the press.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>MSP:  no cure-all</b></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly,  MSPs are not suited to all types of problems and all kinds of policy contexts.  While explicitly starting from diversity, MSPs tend to 'homogenise' the problem,  looking for consensual solutions by providing a conducive space for mutual understanding.  Where conflicts are totally antagonistic (see Table below), there is little hope  for such a collaborative process. Likewise, in a habitat where diversity and debate  are frowned upon, MSPs are unlikely to work. Legal, political or bureaucratic  concerns can limit the space for utilising the result from negotiation and, where  applicable, lessons learned. (LEEWIS &amp; van den BAN, 2003). MSPs, then, are  a recommended practice where the field is not dominated by a single actor and  there is a basic willingness (eagerness) to communicate.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much  of the MSP literature is inspired by Habermas' (1984) ideas on communicative rationality,  in which to strive for 'authentic speech situations' where everybody will speak  their minds regardless of politics and institutions. The expectation is that through  dialogue, perceptions and problem definitions will change and converge (PONCELET,  1998). An aversion to (party) politics and conflict informs this particular literature.  For many, the lack of harmony, incompatibility and struggle inherent in politics  and conflict continues to have a negative connotation. However, our research finds  that MSPs tend to be also political and often conflictive in nature, both within  the platform itself and between the platform and its broader environment, resulting  from a diversity of needs, interests, perceptions and cultures in the dealing  with water resources. Such diversity should not necessarily result in a violent  confrontation, and therefore not necessarily be experienced as negative.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  Habermasian belief in communication as a means to overcome the limitations of  institutions and political processes certainly has contributed to skepticism about  MSPs - not everybody is a believer. In fairness, however, this school of thought  has never claimed that stakeholder dialogues themselves will solve deep-rooted  conflicts. Multi-stakeholder processes are not going to work where oppositions  are fundamental. It is just not the right policy instrument for it.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certain criteria    need to be fulfilled to justify considering MSP processes at all - there have    to be conflicting interests, the stakeholders have to feel interdependent and    there have to be opportunities for constructive communication between the stakeholders    (AARTS &amp; van WOERKUM, 2000). The nature of a problem should be structured    such that consensus on norms, values and goals as well as desired knowledge    is feasible (Table 1).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v8n2/28602t1.gif"></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If  these preconditions are unlikely to be met via multi-stakeholder platforms, other  negotiation and learning strategies or even confrontation, or deferring the problem  may be more successful. In that sense, <i>pace</i> R&ouml;ling, dialogue is not  our <i>only</i> hope.</font></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>4.  POWER SHARING?</b></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  majority of platforms do not come together spontaneously. There may be a charismatic  leader with good political access setting things in motion, but more usually there  is an external facilitator (or facilitating organisation) who convenes and motivates  the platform. A government agency (Ministry of Environment) or hired consultancy  may be the facilitator when the state initiates the process, while in bottom-up  processes, an NGO (WWF) or university will usually be the leader. The platforms  supported by international governmental institutions such as IWMI, IDRC and EU  may also be categorised into the latter group where the platform initiatives intend  to empower local groups. Still, the distinction between bottom-up and top-down  makes little practical sense in terms of results, since in all of the externally  facilitated cases, a general dependency on the external facilitator is encountered  for the continuation of the platform.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While  we encountered 'bottom-up' platforms initiated by NGOs in Peru and South Africa,  and private (water) companies in the UK now are experimenting with consumer fora,  more often the initiator of a water forum is the public sector. As Bruns (2003)  notes, a 'ladder of participation' - a popular tool to grade the level of public  participation - in fact indicates the degrees to which governments share and delegate  power to non-public actors.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Governments  can be quite schizophrenic with respect to delegation of powers. On the one hand,  they have gone a long way to privatise water services and decentralise management  and operation, on the other hand, states prove conspicuously unwilling to forego  significant control. Apart from their Weberian monopoly on the means of violence,  governments have certain exclusive resources at their disposal such as sizeable  budgets and personnel, special powers, access to the mass media and democratic  legitimation. Access to these resources generally means that governments have  considerable power in particular to define the strategic space of any other actor.  For all the sea changes in public management in response to state overload and  policy failures - the New Public Management, network management - states are not  going to relinquish much of their power primacy. Moreover, new infra-structural  projects have large sunk costs, so that allowing a process that may have the outcome  the planners envisaged means a major project risk. Governments may therefore &acute;sit  on&acute; river basin information, as did the Wallonian authorities (Verhallen,  pers. comm.), or otherwise, intentionally or unintentionally, frustrate the process  by burdening stakeholders with heaps of technical information. In the Altotiet&eacute;  basin, Nagy de Oliveira Campos (2004) found stakeholders had to tenaciously wade  through a pile of inscrutable reports to retrieve the river data they needed.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Delegation  should not be confused with offloading operational responsibilities. The Bangladesh  Water Development Board (BWDB), for example, is now very happy to devolve responsibility  for the operation and maintenance of neglected, at times decrepit flood management,  irrigation and drainage infrastructure onto users themselves, who by taking charge  of operation and maintenance are expected to develop a sense of ownership. However,  the latter have no choice in the matter, or on the budget, which makes the transfer  deeply unpopular.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In  practice, we find a lack of mandate in all multi-stakeholder processes we have  observed in the MSP-ICM project. Most participatory processes remain at the information  and consultation stages, which in view of the much-used Arnstein's ladder rates  as 'phony participation'. 'Meaningful participation' would require devolving mandates  down to the lowest practicable level and giving people the right to say 'no' to  interventions that make perfect sense technically, economically and environmentally.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is  the lack of meaningful mandate a problem? This is a relevant concern, since most  multi-stakeholder platforms we encountered can be said to have been conceived  as a sounding board rather than a policy-making body. They are like think tanks  or focus groups (Type 2, below), providing policymakers with ideas and feedback  from selected social groups. We found that the fact that MSPs do not generally  share power to any significant degree in itself does not have to be a major problem  while the participants are aware of the limited extent of their say. It appears  many stakeholder groups do not necessarily wish to take responsibility of co-management  of the resource, which they see primarily as a public task. They do however want  to be heard and not left out of the process, and, as in the case of the Nete,  are annoyed if they missed out on key information. In this sense, the arrangement  can bring enough benefits to both initiators and consultants.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How  much power is actually gained by platforms? This section presents a typology of  multi-stakeholder processes according to their degree of influence. Largely based  on such PhD and MSP research as was feasible in the course of the MSP-ICM project,  it is by no means representative of the global MSP scene - although it may be  indicative as a heuristic.</font></p>    ]]></body>

Those involved stress  time and again the crucial importance of the process itself as a communication  and visioning process, especially in low-trust societies such as post-violence,  post-dictatorship, post-apartheid societies.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although  they may not solve conflict and problems, MSP can make life better, even as social  events. Several Kat and Mtata 'rivrer forum twinning events' were co-organised  by our project together with Rhodes University to stimulate mutual learning about  the different experiences of a 'top-down' and a 'bottom-up' platform but also  worked especially well as a social gathering where story-telling, discussion and  singing and dancing alternated (SIMPUNGWE, 2003 on <a href="http://www.dow.wau.nl/msp" target="_blank">www.dow.wau.nl/msp</a>).</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather  than actual platforms, which suggests physically fixed space with an organisational  structure and secretariat, Multi-Stakeholder Platforms may in fact primarily be  networks. In a network problem-solving capacity is dispersed (Glasbergen 1995).  Platforms and networks are both metaphors. While platforms suggest a form of institutionalisation,  network management (KICKERT, 1993) suggests shifting alliances, not necessarily  tied to one place.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  'Yakunchik' MSP in Ayacucho, Peru (OR&Eacute;, 2004), for example, is currently  more like a 'phone circle', a group of people who are in touch with each other  but do not actually have a secretariat and an office at their disposal. Even if  they now have little concrete action to show for, interviewees claim they greatly  value the fact that the multi-stakeholder network exists at all.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>TYPE  2 - Focus group</b></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This  is the type of MSP we encountered most frequently in the research project. MSP  processes are especially found in planning and visioning processes, convoked by  the government, where plans for the future may be at a less detailed stage, with  a discrete number of sessions.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This  participation process is extractive in the sense that at relatively low investment,  the government has access to a socially embedded advisory body, where it can learn  about the range of interests and positions involved, and what policy aspects are  likely to generate fierce opposition. Stakeholders themselves get to hear first  about new policies and can request more specific information or amenities.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  NGO-initiated processes are set up intending to bring about important changes,  and in places they manage to make important changes. However, we see little empowerment  and delegation of power taking place even in these cases.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>TYPE  3 - Service organisation</b></font></p>    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An  MSP may seek to take advantage of the breadth of the network to generate external  support, catering to a collective need. The dialogue on the Sabarmati basin in  Gujarat, India (KUMAR et al. 1999) developed from the different relationships  of agricultural and industrial stakeholder groups had with a facilitating NGO,  VIKSAT. Joining these networks, this platform managed to find funds for, among  others, water conservation facilities such as roof cisterns. The groups involved  sometimes meet in a plenary, but more often bilaterally to work out shared issues  or present a proposal for technical assistance. The Sabarmati MSP was supported  by Canadian (IDRC) aid. Now that this programme has run out, the challenge is  to keep the platform going.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>TYPE  4 - Crisis management organisation</b></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Devolving  power to lower-level actors is hard enough for states delegating power to trans-  and international actors proves out to be even harder. Sovereignty is sacrosanct  both with respect to societal actors and other nations. Even commissions regulating  international rivers shared by friendly states often co-operate as little as possible.  In this context, the space for stakeholder involvement in trans-boundary stakeholder  platforms seems an uphill battle. However, on special occasions a multi-stakeholder  dialogue can be resorted to as a 'Track Two&acute; activity, and in so doing develop  considerable momentum, tackling issues where normal negotiations fail. The Zwin  Commission, a multi-stakeholder body comprising Dutch and Belgian governmental  and non-governmental actors to manage an area of great natural beauty, is emblematic  - like a may fly , which shows only once a year in spectacular swarms, it only  showed in exceptional political weather conditions during its 70 year existence  (SANTBERGEN, pers. comm.).</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When  the platform is used especially for occasional dispute settlement or negotiation  processes, it can be expected to lie dormant for a long time and occasionally  spring to life. Other trans-boundary MSPs similarly seem to be there to solve  incidents and crises, not for permanent water management. National autonomies  still prevail in day-to-day water management.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In  Tiquipaya, Bolivia, an 'intervention MSP' was established to mediate between urban  and rural users, suppliers and government actor over a controversial sanitation  project which had led to violence and the resignation of the mayor (FAYSSE et  al, 2005). Post-disaster co-ordination platforms as in Ica, Per&uacute; (Or&eacute;,  2004) can similarly be headed under this rubric</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>TYPE  5 - Action Alliance</b></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A  different, more radical type of multi-stakeholder alliance is found in response  to unpopular interventions or policies. Here, negotiation is a possible outcome  of an anti-intervention drive.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In  India, non-violent resistance movements to the dams in the Narmada valley, Gujarat  and Southern Maharashtra, and citizen initiatives on the Chalakudy River took  place. In the dispute over the Tar Ohl dam, which the Maharashtra state government  was pressed to build quickly, a social movement composed of low-case landless  and smallholders, backed by progressive industrial leaders, organised mass sit-ins  to coax the Maharashtra state government into a more co-operative response to  civil protest - more co-operative, that is, than the initial ham-fisted police  intervention. Interestingly, the alliance involved both groups that stood to gain  from a new dam and those who stood to lose form resettlement. In so doing, the  platform managed to <i>co-opt</i> rather than alienate the government, bringing  social pressure to bear to negotiating amenities for resettled evacuees.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In  each of those cases, the resource issue is the focus of much wider social struggles.  Here, a multi- sectorial network forms to join forces against a common touchstone,  initiated by government.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>TYPE  6 - River Basin Organisation</b></font></p>    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  catchment level is emerging as the 'natural' unit for water management in Europe  and elsewhere. Water resource management has long been a top-down concern of many  states, and water authorities followed administrative boundaries. River basins  criss-cross administrative boundaries, and now that hydrology rather than territorial  administrative or cultural boundaries dictate the management scale, states are  forced to work together.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public  participation in the management of river basin areas is explicitly stipulated  in Article 14 of the European Water Framework Directive (EWFD; EUROPEAN UNION,  2000), which states that the general public should not only be informed, but also  consulted in the formulation of management plans. However, there are indications  that the understanding of participation in the Directive accepts public involvement  being scaled back to consultation and information provision (type 2).</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like  the EWFD, the Brazilian watershed-based water management model can be said to  be fashioned after the French model (<i>Agences de l'Eau</i>), which allocates  seats to key stakeholder groups at catchment level. The Brazilian water law gives  great scope for participation - but taking that space is another matter while  the playing field is far from level. In the Para&iacute;ba do Sul catchment, Mostertman  (2005) found that it tends to be mainly the institutional stakeholders who exert  influence on the process - quite similar to the French experience. While some  basin committees give the impression of a sleepwalking existence, others, such  as the Comit&ecirc;s das Bacias Hidrogr&aacute;ficas dos Rios Piracicaba, Capivari  e Jundia&iacute; (<a href="http://www.comitepcj.sp.gov.br" target="_blank">www.comitepcj.sp.gov.br</a>),  are quite decisive. Still, the Brazilian experience is a recent and developing  one, and a number of active NGOs and universities may well succeed in increasing  the space for less powerful actors.</font></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>5.  WHAT IF STAKEHOLDERS DO NOT PARTICIPATE?</b></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A  stake in water is, in itself, a pleonasm - at root, everyone has a stake in water,  as no one can hope to live very long without any water intake. The new, post-Apartheid  South African water law of 1998 therefore invites <i>all</i> to participate in  decision-making over water resource management. Noble as this sounds, it is pretty  much impracticable. Clearly, not everybody is going to participate in the all-inclusive  agora democracy of the ancient Greek city-states - where, upon closer scrutiny,  slaves, women and those without possession did not have the vote anyway. In modern  days, convening stakeholders on a regular basis similarly involves the issue of  <i>selectivity</i>, if on the basis of different criteria. An MSP is a controlled  space in which specific topics are discussed with specific people. In practice,  the stakeholders are not often self-selecting and self-motivated, they are often  invited to participate by external facilitators or present themselves as an organised  interest group. This gives considerable discretion to facilitators, who can design  a 'box' defining who will discuss and how the problem is defined. If these facilitators  are not totally scrupulous about stakeholder selection, this necessarily puts  potentially interested, but unorganised parties at a disadvantage. Only by organising  themselves and making a noise they can hope to be admitted in a second run. When  we look for stakeholders, we should therefore expect selectively in and (self-)  excluded groups. It is not just the MSP facilitator or board who decides who is  in and out.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The  assumption that opening a space for participation will mean enthusiastic involvement  of stakeholders turns out to be invalid. A prevalent mistake concerns under- or  overestimating people's abilities and <i>a priori</i> motivation to participate  (WARNER &amp; MOREYRA, 2004; also see COOKE &amp; KOTHARI 2001). Where salience  is obvious, as in dike maintenance in Holland in the Middle Ages, everyone's involvement  is called for. But in creeping catastrophes such as drought or pollution, many  may not be convinced of a platforms' direct 'relevance' to their needs.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It  is important to understand that groups may well <i>exclude themselves</i> from  the process, as they feel the benefits from participating do not justify the (opportunity)  costs. It emerges from our case studies that not everyone wants to be integrated.  The scale can be an impediment from making it interesting. In this sense, integration  and participation seem to pull in opposite directions - people are motivated to  participate in a clear, single-issue, close-to-the-bone area, while integrated  management, because of the complexity of all the interrelationships, seems to  invite centralisation. An example is the Altotiet&eacute; watershed committee  in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, which seeks to decentralise water management  to bring it closer to the citizens. In this sense it is one of the very few truly  metropolitan platforms in Brazil. But as Jacobi (2004) notes, this downscaling  inevitably brings about fragmentation where an integrated metropolitan policy  would be called for to combat the severe environmental problems the watershed  is faced with.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If  there are few wins to be had (Yakunchik platform, Per&uacute;) or project money  runs out (Sabarmati platform, India), the platform is moribund. People are not  apathetic, as has often been assumed in the past, but they can be frustrated into  thinking that nothing ever changes even if they put time and effort into participation.  Participation involves important economic and political opportunity costs to stakeholder  groups, which may outweigh the benefits of co-operation. Actors may therefore  think twice about joining the decision-making process. Especially where integration  seems a euphemism for assimilation or co-optation, MSPs may not be popular with  intended actor groups. They run the risk of being co-opted to the extent that  they (are seen to have) become part of the technocratic elite, thus losing their  legitimacy with a constituency that expects them to rally support against issues.  We should therefore keep an eye out for the non-represented, both powerful and  powerless groups. Do they really ignore the MSP? Do they interact informally with  actors, or go around the platform to access those in power to get what they want?  It may be more advantageous for some groups to wait on the sidelines until things  get more interesting, or to drop out and work around the MSP, mobilising a constituency  outside it.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As  a form of communicative governance - learning together - MSPs can indeed increase  understanding and acceptance of new ideas and policies, intending to change people's  minds about a controversial issue - 'participation' seems the magic word that  will 'create' a support base for acceptance of new policies. After all, 'Effectiveness  = Quality times Acceptance' is a rule of thumb in management literature (e.g.  see <a href="http://www.gehealthcare.com/euen/services/performance-solutions%20/methodology.html" target="_blank">www.gehealthcare.com/euen/services/performance-solutions  /methodology.html</a>). An example of an attempt to 'create a support base' for  changes and interventions such as water pricing and new infrastructure is the  Paraiba do Sul river basin committee (MOSTERTMAN, 2005). That the take-up of the  process was moderate should not be surprising. Communication experts (such as  AARTS &amp; van WOERKUM, 2000) remind us that you cannot change people's attitudes  and behaviour if they are fundamentally unhappy with the policy. You cannot 'sell'  an unpopular plan unless there is something in it for everyone. If the starting  point of the intervention or institutional change cannot be subject to discussion,  strong opponents will question the legitimacy of the process itself (I call this  'second-order conflict', in contrast with 'first-order' conflict over the allocation  of the water resource itself).</font></p>    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such  observations should not be taken to imply that skeptical groups will not become  active at all. Groups may feel that participating in platforms robs them of leverage.  Once galvanised, radical environmental or identity groups can be expected not  to participate so as to have their 'hands free' in staging extra-parliamentary  protests outside the platform, or less visible ways of putting pressure on decision-makers.  Such counter-hegemonic participation may not be what MSP initiators had in mind,  but participation in a sociological sense it certainly is - as Norman Long (2001)  has shown, participation is any action knowledgeable social actors undertake to  alter their conditions of living, whether or not it fits the 'box' designed by  initiators of participatory platforms. We have also come across groups that 'have  their cake and eat it', that is, operating both inside and outside the participatory  process.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Others  bide their time and wait for the right moment to enter the fray. We found two  cases in which farmers belatedly demanded a seat around the table when they became  aware of the platform. In the Scheldt estuary, Flemish farmer organisations gained  a seat on the estuary platform later in the process and seemed to benefit from  'preferential treatment' from other participants to get them up to speed with  proceedings (VERHALLEN, pers. comm. 2005). In Per&uacute;, the well-organised  farmer's union JUDRA gained observer status in the 'Yakunchik' platform in Ayacucho  in 2002, sparking off a debate whether they should be incorporated in the platform  or, conversely, whether the platform should be incorporated in their well-oiled  lobby (OR&Eacute;, 2004).</font></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>6.  RESULTS NEEDED</b></font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently,  deliberation is enthusiastically embraced in the water world. But is anyone listening?  MSPs are a 'beast' to which almost mystical powers tend to be attributed, often  appearing in policy tales, but as yet rarely spotted in broad daylight. Without  a mandate, there is no obligation to do anything with the outcome of all the talk.  Without an audience, MSPs are dialogues of the deaf. The Dialogue on Water, Food  and Environment seems to have imploded, in part due to a sudden Dutch governmental  decision to decimate funding. If that trend continues, MSPs as a new institutional  species will join the ranks of the red herring, the paper tiger and the white  elephant.</font></p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In  that context, one the first amendments the MSP-ICM research team made to the working  definition of Multi-Stakeholder Platforms was to include an <i>action</i> component,  to avoid the danger of MSP turning into a talking shop. Management texts on innovation,  such as Hamel (2000), suggest you need quick wins to carry the revolution though.  For their participants not to lose interest, MSPs need to be clear about their  goals and produce 'food on the table'. The saying can be taken quite literally  for the poor - 'for the hungry man, the beauty of the beast is in the pot' (quoted  in BINDRABAN, 2004).</font></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>REFERENCES</b></font></p>    <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AARTS,  N. &amp; van WOERKUM, C.

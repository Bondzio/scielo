Abstract This article analyzes how teachers and students conceive of environmental education and how these modes of perception become workshops held at school. We believe that knowing in Environmental Education implies not only interacting with information about the environmental problem, because it involves the inventive cognition, ways of enacting and conserving what we want to live. The methodology we used was intervention research, where we followed changes in a course of photographic image production and networks of conversations built with students and teachers. As a result, we could observe ways of conceiving the environmental education and displacements that occur during the course. The subjects, when acting in the workshops, transform gestures, ideas and emotions that allow an opening for the understanding of Environmental Education as care and promotion of life.

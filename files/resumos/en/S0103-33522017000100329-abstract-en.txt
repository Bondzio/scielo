Abstract In Western history, animals were used, by opposition, to define the concept of humanity. Men were the only ones to think, be conscious, talking and especially being a political animal. Several recent episodes from the political scene, however, shown that the animal protection movement, the rise of new sensibilities and population pressure have exerted influence in government with the establishment of the pro-animal vote. In this scenario, based on the analysis of cases of national impact and specific episodes of Mato Grosso, this article examines the increased participation of animals in political movements and investigates the redefinition of humanity and animality parameters that this new reality has driven.

Introduction<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a></b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There can be little    dispute that the European Union is passing through a severe crisis. Even ardent    pro-Europeans and EU diplomats admit, or be it 'off-the-record', that the EU    is currently facing extreme difficulties.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>    Yet, when one talks about the EU crisis at the moment, the main focus is still    on the economic difficulties which are particularly acute in the Eurozone and,    within that, in a group of countries on the southern periphery of the continent,    such as Greece, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus, Ireland being the geographic exception.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The argument put    forward in this article is that, despite the undoubted severity of the crisis,    the current economic difficulties faced by some members of the European single    currency merely <i>add</i> to a much deeper, and much more political, crisis    faced by the European Union as a whole. It will be shown that the economic difficulties    are both partially the <i>result</i> of this deeper political crisis, and a    factor in the deepening of the same, one which, as will be shown, has the potential    to, at least, seriously undermine the prospects for further European integration    in the future and, therefore, the future of the European Union itself.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to confront    this crisis, the article will show, the EU, and those who take decisions within    it, will have to move away from their very narrow definition of the problems    they are confronting and begin seeing them as part of a continuous <i>process</i>    which will only be steered into calmer waters again if the EU takes some tough    strategic decisions about where the organization wants to go and why it actually    still exists.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a brief review    of the current problems and the 'state of play’ in addressing them, the article    will go on to contrast the EU's current approach to its problems with an approach    informed by the concept of <i>adaptive action</i>, developed by Eoyang and Holladay    (2013). Using the three key questions that inform adaptive action (What? So    what? Now what?), the article will re-conceptualize the crisis currently confronted    by the EU and will make some specific suggestions as to how it should act and    what it should do to get through its current difficulties.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>II. The context:    the European Union and the economic crisis</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In many ways the    economic nature of the crisis confronted by the European Union seems almost    too obvious. One brief look at just <i>some</i> of the indicators which measure    Europe's economic performance shows that, clearly, the continent and, as such,    the European Union, is confronting awesome challenges. Just to give some examples:    between January and March 2013, Greece, perhaps the worst hit country of all    in Europe, notched up its 19<sup>th</sup> (!) consecutive quarter of negative    growth.<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> In Spain, despite    a small drop in unemployment in June 2013, still over a quarter of the workforce    are out of a job, with more than 50% of young people not economically active.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>    In Ireland, some areas have seen property prices fall over 50% since 2007<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>    whilst several countries, &#150; again with Greece as leader amongst them &#150;    faced an accumulated public debt far exceeding national GDP (Finanzkrise: Euro    L&auml;nder h&auml;ufen neue Schulden an, 2013).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since all of these    countries are bound together by the fact that they take part in a monetary union    and share a single currency, this has meant that the 'sovereign debt crisis’    (as it has been termed by some, such as Lane (2012)), turned itself into a severe    crisis for the Eurogroup in particular but, as will be argued, by the European    Union as a whole, which was faced by numerous &#150; and often contradictory    &#150; pressures to 'get a grip’ on the situation, lest a process of 'contagion’    affected other or all Eurozone countries and EU member states. On the one hand,    the European Union as a whole needed to safeguard its own single currency and    ensure its stability. To do so, it was critical that member countries did not    default on their debt which would have meant their exit from the single currency    with unpredictable consequences both for the currency itself and the wider international    financial system. It was therefore critical to ensure the liquidity of both    individual countries and the financial system as a whole. On the other hand,    it was seen as necessary to radically reduce the indebtedness of Eurozone countries.    In some cases (Greece and Italy prominent amongst them), policy-makers therefore    faced the unenviable task of reducing the indebtedness of the state at a time    of a severe economic recession.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bearing in mind    the above, it is perhaps not surprising that the European Union chose to define    its problems through an economic prism and focus its anti-crisis policies primarily    on economic and fiscal indicators. In order to ensure that no Eurozone state    default on its debts, the so-called 'Troika’ of the European Union, the European    Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have demanded, in some    cases, deep cuts to public spending (and, as a result, public services) in return    for so-called bail-out funds designed to ensure that states were in a position    to meet ongoing financial commitments. The Economist (No Going Back 2009)was    not the only outlet to call the sums involved 'breathtaking', with the initial    Stabilization fund consisting of no less than 750bn euros. This fund has been    followed by the setting-up of a permanent 'stabilization mechanism', as well    as the tightening of the rules governing the single currency and moves to create    both some type of economic union as well as a banking union.<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without doubt,    these actions have had considerable impact and achieved their overriding initial    objective of stopping Eurozone countries going into default. However, many commentators    and analysts doubt whether enough has been done to resolve the crisis or whether    the crisis is in fact over, as proclaimed by French president Francois Holland    recently, with The Economist (Till default do us part 2013) again leading the    charge.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>III. Analyzing    and evaluating the crisis from an EU perspective</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the last few    years a considerable amount of literature has emerged analyzing both the origins    of - and the EU’s response to - the crisis which has befallen it from an economic    perspective, with even American Congress producing a detailed study, illustrating    the global impact the crisis has had (Nelson et al. 2012). Within this literature    one can distinguish between two different aspects of analysis: one essentially    asks how the EU got itself into the situation it is in whilst the other focusses    more on whether it has done enough to get itself out of this situation and what    else needs to be done in order not to confront such a situation again in the    future.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amongst those who    have focused on the question of how we got here, several core arguments can    be identified which will be crucial in the later argument about the political    crisis faced by the EU as a whole. From a purely economic point of view, several    specialists have pointed out that the European Union as a whole never represented    a so-called 'optimum currency area'. According to this argument, both the macro-economic    circumstances as well as the economic policies pursued by national governments    were simply too different as to be able to form a stable and durable currency    union as, for instance, Bayoumi and Eichgreen (1993) have argued. Following    this line of argument, it can be said that the European Union itself was aware    of this problem when it stipulated the pre-conditions a country had to fulfill    before being considered for membership of the single currency, as well as the    rules to be followed once 'inside the club': these rules, as spelled out in    the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, at first glance, seemed unambiguous,    as Nugent (2010) showed. They committed the members to the pursuit of low inflation    and supposedly put a cap on the amount of public debt a government could accumulate    (60% of GDP) and the annual budget deficits it would be allowed to run (3% of    GDP). The fact that breaches of these rules could be punished and that Eurozone    monetary policy was also to be overseen by an entirely independent European    Central Bank, the ECB, was also intended to ensure that the Eurozone would become    progressively more coherent internally.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, there    is a general consensus, &#150; and subsequent events would suggest this fact    to be obvious, &#150; that these rules were simply not good enough on the grounds    that they were not underpinned by governance mechanisms strong enough to ensure    compliance with the very rules the EU itself established. Kramer (2012, p. 83)    described the governance system of the single currency as 'fragile', seeing    as it was dependent on the agreement and cooperation of the same member-states    it was meant to control. In simple terms, member-states decided whether to punish    member-states for breaching the rules of the single currency. Wallace, Pollack    and Young (2010) make similar arguments.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kramer (2012, p.    83) concludes that this fragility was the result of essentially political factors.    According to him the two main drivers and architects of economic and monetary    union, former German chancellor Helmut Kohl and the late French president Francois    Mitterand, 'acted as statesmen, not economists’ in setting up monetary union,    seeing it as an instrument to anchor a reunified Germany in the European Union    in the aftermath of the Cold War whilst advancing the cause of European integration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This interplay    between economic and political factors can be seen throughout the history of    the single currency. Critically, for instance, the inclusion of Greece in 2001    was seen as a purely political decision, whilst underlining the weakness of    the enforcement mechanisms, bearing in mind that Greece was in no position to    fulfill the convergence criteria, joining basically by 'cooking the books’ (B&ouml;ll    et al. 2012). Equally significant was the fact that both Germany and France    broke the the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. Yet, rather than being    punished, the pact was amended to make it more flexible, bowing to political    pressure.All of this led B&ouml;ll et al. (<i>idem</i>) to entitle their overview    of the origins of the euro 'Operation self-deceit'. Ever since then what has    been lacking is 'a European government which could analyze problems from a European    perspective’ (Kramer 2012, p. 83).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From that point    of view, many saw the crisis of monetary union as inevitable in the absence    of an accompanying political union. One senior EU diplomat put it this way:    'I think [the crisis shows that] we have reached the end of the line as far    as what we can do with intergovernmentalism'.<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a>    This is crucial since it points to the fact that the current crisis of the <i>Eurozone</i>    is a result of a bigger crisis of the <i>European Union</i>, namely the inability    of its political leaders to get the 'big things right’ because of a lack of    political agreement, an argument forcefully made by Bittner (2010). More will    be said on this below.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another group of    analysts have looked at the <i>results</i> of EU policies in the response to    crisis, basically austerity in return for bailout funds. Interestingly, their    conclusions point to the same problems already talked about above.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generally speaking,    the results of the EU’s policies have been deeply disappointing. As Blyth (2013,    p. 42) has pointed out, despite often deep cuts in public spending, 'Portugal's    debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 62% in 2008 to 108% in 2012. Greece's debt-to-GDP    ratio climbed from a 106% in 2007 to 170% in 2012.’ Incredible as it might seem,    the situation worsened further up to 2013, with the debt-to-GDP ratio of the    Eurozone as a whole reaching 92%, '4% higher than in 2012’ (Finanzkrise: Euro    L&auml;nder neue Schulden anh&auml;ufenÂ… 2013). This scenario has led some,    like Krugman (2012), to argue that, not only had the European Union failed to    deal with the problems in hand, but it had actually made a bad situation worse:    it had managed, just like several other political decision-makers around the    world, to turn a recession into a depression, with devastating consequences    mainly for the poorest countries and the poorest segments of the population.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a further critique,    some analysts have argued that, apart from austerity taking billions of euros    out of the economy at precisely the wrong time, the actions have also left the    broader problems that contributed to the crisis unresolved. For instance, whilst    it may well have been necessary to cut public expenditure in Greece, this will    mean very little in the long-term as long as 'structural and fiscal problems    remain' (Subacchi &amp; Pickford 2012, p. 3). In other words, apart from cutting    spending, very little has been done to address the structural root causes that    led to the crisis in the first place, both at national and at European level.    Crucially, the EU has been strongly criticized in this respect for not taking    sufficient account of the <i>particular</i> circumstances of each country, adopting    instead a broad-brush macro-level approach to dealing with the crisis. For instance,    it has been argued that only Greece had a real <i>debt</i>-crisis. In Spain    and Ireland, by contrast, there was a housing bubble whilst Cyprus has recently    faced a liquidity crisis in the banking sector. According to this line of argument,    made by Krugman (2012) amongst others, each one of these cases requires a nuanced    policy approach. So far, this has not been forthcoming from the European Union,    pointing once again to the political crisis through which it is passing as a    whole.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This begs the question    as to why the European Union has not been able to develop a policy-strategy    which would bring the crisis under control and here one, once again, comes to    the political aspects of the entire European project.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 'modus operandi’    of the EU during the crisis was neatly summed up by Copsey and Haughton (2012,    p. 1) when they attested that European leaders 'lurched from one emergency summit    to another’ in a desperate search for stability in the Eurozone. Even EU diplomats    admit that the spectacle is often unedifying, but point out that the way the    organization operates is the result of its unique features: 'We need to do many    things together but, in the end, the EU has 27 (now 28) members, all of them    sovereign states'.<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a> In other    words, the very success of the EU (as measured by its continuous expansion)    leads to deep fault-lines in its functioning and, seemingly, diminishing prospects    for future integration even in the face of severe crises like the current one.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This fact, for    some, puts the very future of the European Union as it is currently constituted    in doubt. Tsoukalis (2011) pointedly entitled his review of EU activities in    2010 'the shattering of illusions'. Jo Johnson et al. (2012) at Chatham House,    one of the most respected think tanks for international politics in Europe,    asked if the objective of 'ever closer union’ enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty    was still attainable, and, again, Copsey and Haughton (2012, p. 1) stated bluntly    that 'crisis appears to be the new normal state of the European Union'.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some have gone    further and argued that the European Union has almost always been in crisis,    but that the <i>nature</i> of the crisis makes the current one more dangerous    for the future of the integration process. As Hodson and Puetter (2013, p. 367)    have put it: 'Looking back on the history of European integration, it is difficult    to remember a time when the European Union or its predecessors were not facing    a crisis of one sort or another'.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is different    this time, though, is the particular division between 'crisis states' and 'non-crisis    states'. The first group is made up generally of small states on the southern    periphery of the European Union, whilst the latter group consists, generally,    of the rich, northern states. As one keen and long-standing observer of European    affairs noted at a seminar, this particular division is something new in the    history of European integration and has put into question one of <i>the</i>    key principles upon which the process of integration has always rested since    its inception in the 1950s: solidarity. If, according to this observer, this    pillar of mutual solidarity now breaks away, the very future of the integration    project would be in doubt.<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several commentators    have pointed to Germany and its posture as the key reason for the erosion of    solidarity between EU (and in particular, Eurozone) member states. Mallaby (2012),    for example, stated bluntly that Europe's was an 'optional catastrophe' and    that its fate now lay 'in Germany's hands' which needed to develop strategies    for growth instead of merely focusing on austerity. Such narrow focus, according    to Tooze (2012) will lead to stagnation for Germany in the future.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In view of all    these difficulties, some have called for further integration. As one senior    EU official put it: 'We need a political union'.<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a>    Berggruen and Gardels (2013, p. 134) agree, calling for a concerted effort 'toward    a federal union’. However, others have stated that the current difficulties    merely underline the folly of embarking on the path towards a single currency    in the first place and warn that any move towards further integration, such    as a fiscal union would merely undermine the future prospects for the organization    still further, creating deep divisions between those inside the Eurozone and    those outside, making coherent political action in response not just to economic    difficulties but to a host of others issues more difficult (Milne 2013).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following this    line of argument, the creation of the single currency and its deficient execution    has led not only to deep divisions between rich northern and poor southern countries    <i>inside</i> the group of single-currency countries but also between those    countries which use the single currency and those <i>outside</i> it. Again,    looking at the recent history of European integration, the fact that such divisions    emerged should not really have come as a surprise. So-called 'opt-outs’ that    some countries have in some policy areas have become increasingly common, one    could even say normal, ever since the very Maastricht Treaty which instigated    economic and monetary union as Dinan (2004) has shown. In many ways, bearing    in mind the increasing complexity of the EU, opt-outs constituted the only way    to continue <i>some</i> type of integration, as Walton and Zilonka (2013) have    argued, but this has come at a cost, as the above discussion shows, in terms    of coherence.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EU, therefore,    confronts multiple crises: a deep economic one which manifests itself most profoundly    in some of those countries that use the European single currency, but also a    significant political one which affects the entire EU and which needs to be    overcome in order to actually effectively deal with the economic crisis. Failure    to do so has accelerated two other crises: a crisis of legitimacy and a crisis    of direction which evolve around the question what the European Union is actually    <i>for.</i> It is these aspects which, as will be shown now, exist semi-independently    from the economic crisis, which make the current situation so threatening for    the future of the EU.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>IV. European    integration, but for what? The crisis of direction and leadership</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There can be little    doubt that the failure of the European Union to effectively deal with the economic    crisis has had an adverse effect on the legitimacy of the organization. According    to the EU’s own public opinion surveys, only just over 1 in 5 EU citizens believes    that the European Union is capable of resolving the crisis through its actions    (European Commission 2013, p. 3). Equally worrying, more than half of all EU    citizens believe that the worst of the economic crisis is still to come, an    astonishing number bearing in mind the length of time the crisis has been ongoing    (IBID).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recent surveys    have also underscored the EU's north-south divide already touched upon above,    with only 1% of Spaniards and 2% of Cypriots and Greeks expressing confidence    about the state of their country's economy, a figure which shoots up to 80%    and 77% respectively when the same question is asked of Swedes or Germans (Fox    2013). Critically in terms of the EU's future prospects, 89% of Cypriots and    Greeks contend that their voices are not being heard inside the European Union    (IBID).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The upper echelons    of the European Union's political leadership are aware of these problems. As    one EU ambassador put it: 'It is critical to solve the crisis in order to win    back the trust of the population'.<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a>    However, research done by Serricchio, Tsakatika and Quaglia (2013) has found    that euro-skepticism has many causes, of which the economic crisis is one, but    not the most important one. Whilst the rise in Euro-skepticism is most pronounced    in those countries hardest hit by the economic crisis and whilst there has been    a steady increase in skepticism towards the European Union since the onset of    the economic crisis &#150; nevertheless 'national identity and political institutions    play an increasingly important role in explaining public euro-skepticism’ (<i>idem</i>,    51).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reference to    political institutions is critical in this respect since other authors have    also argued that skepticism towards such institutions is both a <i>generalized</i>    phenomenon and one which <i>pre-dates</i> the economic crisis. As Wessels (2007)    pointed out, there is increasing skepticism towards authorities and regimes    in general. Applied to the European Union, left unchecked, such tendencies have    the potential to significantly undermine support for the <i>general</i> project    of European integration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Critically this    indicates that the economic crisis 'merely’ <i>accelerated</i> a process which    has been ongoing for some time, suggesting that the EU has some deep-seeded    problems which go way beyond resolving the economic problems it is currently    confronting. For a growing number of commentators the problems are actually    very basic but very fundamental: It is the question of what the European Union    is actually for. In the Chatham House debate (Jo Johnson et al. 2012), one participant,    John Peet, argued that the European Union urgently needed to confront issues    of democracy, legitimacy and accountability brought into sharp focus by the    economic crisis (<i>idem</i>, p. 2). Another, John Jungclaussen, went further    saying that the crisis of legitimacy is brought about by a lack of purpose and    direction: 'There is no narrative anymore', as he put it (<i>idem</i>, p. 3).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, such a narrative    has been fundamental in sustaining the European Union over the decades and instrumental    in explaining a large part of its success. In fact, as Manners (2008, p. 65)    demonstrates, the idea of safeguarding peace on the European continent was perhaps    <i>the</i> overriding narrative through which the process of economic integration,    started with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in    the Treaty of Paris, could be justified and sustained both practically and normatively    since 1951. "The success of European integration in achieving peace and sustaining    this narrative 'changed what passes for normal in world politics' (<i>ibidem</i>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Lehmann (2012)    has argued, the successful reconciliation between France and Germany, the stability    and economic prosperity in Western Europe during the Cold War and the generally    successful transition of Eastern Europe from Communism to capitalism and liberal    democracy during the 1990s (with the obvious and terrible exception of the former    Yugoslavia) meant that the EU was able to sustain this narrative over several    decades. In fact, in its attempts to raise its foreign policy profile from the    1990s onwards, the EU pursued a clear discourse of serving as a model for integration    which could be reflected and copied around the world. The eventual entry of    the vast majority of the former communist states of Eastern Europe, including    in 2004 and 2013 respectively the former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and    Croatia, also bears testament to the enduring popularity of the EU with its    immediate neighbors.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The award of the    Nobel Peace Price to the European Union in 2012 in recognition of its achievements    in preserving peace represented, in many ways, the culmination of this process    but, as has been argued, also served as a warning that the future of the organization    dependent on it being able to re-define its purpose and develop a new narrative<b>.</b>    The European Union urgently needs to find an answer to the question being repeatedly    asked during demonstrations in Greece, Spain and elsewhere: 'What can Brussels,    and Europe, do for us’ (Jo Johnson et al., p. 3).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some senior EU    figures acknowledge this as a serious problem. One of them said: 'I think multilateralism    is in a big crisis generally [and as such] we have to admit that our influence    outside Brussels is rather limited'.<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a>    The EU ambassador already cited earlier also admitted these difficulties: 'I    agree that we as an organization are not very good at selling ourselves'.<a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14"><sup>14</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To overcome these    problems, both argued that 'leadership’ was needed. However, as will be shown    now, getting such leadership will be very difficult, principally because the    European Union conceives its own crisis in a way which makes its solution more    difficult.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>V. Re-defining    the European crisis: What? So what? Now what?</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As already shown    above, in its definition and management of the crisis the European Union has    focused almost exclusively on the economic aspects of it. In fact, one can go    even further and argue that, for the EU, the crisis revolves around one key    variable: public debt. So, in response to the question <i>what</i> problem the    European Union is facing, it has consistently responded that <i>some of its    member states</i> are facing a fiscal problem which has an impact on <i>one    particular area of integration</i>: its monetary union of which not all of its    member states are a part. In terms of <i>so what does that mean,</i> as shown    above, it has meant that political action has to focus on changing a couple    of key variables, especially reducing the level of public indebtedness of the    most seriously affected countries. This, in turn, would restore the confidence    of the financial markets, thereby encouraging investment and return those countries    (and the Eurozone as a whole) to growth. As such, in response to the question    of <i>now what</i>, the logical answer has been to cut state expenditure in    those countries most seriously affected by the 'debt crisis', 'restructuring'    the economies in the process. Having brought the 'debt problem' 'under control',    the aim would then need to be to create new, more effective rules in order to    maintain this situation as stable as possible for as long as possible and stopping    the problems that led to the crisis from reoccurring. In short, the EU has defined    its current crisis in a limited and classic 'linear’ fashion, seeing an unfavorable    situation <i>a</i> which, through the application of specific policies to change    a couple of clearly definable variables, could lead to favorable situation <i>b</i>,    which would then need to be maintained for as long as possible, usually through    the 'tightening’ of the rules which govern the particular policy area.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, as has    been shown, this approach has been questioned on two fundamental points: First,    its effectiveness has been called into question on the grounds that, so far,    it has not achieved the desired results. Second, it has been argued that this    approach ignores some of the far deeper problems that the European Union as    a whole faces and which have been exacerbated by the economic crisis but were    not created by it. As shown, the EU actually faces an interdependent mix of    political <i>and</i> economic problems which, in many ways, have led to the    <i>specific</i> problems now confronted in relation to monetary union but which,    it would seem, the current approach is ill equipped to tackle.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Challenged on this    very point by the author, the response of one EU ambassador actually gave rise    to the idea for the present article. The ambassador responded: 'I know that    we have deeper problems, but <i>first</i> we have to solve the economic crisis,    <i>then</i> we can deal with the other things' (my emphasis).<a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a>    In other words, the sequential approach applied to the economic crisis is also    being applied to the political and legitimacy crisis recognized by the EU. Solving    one problem will logically lead to a solution for the other problem.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As will be shown    now, however, such an approach does not recognize the fundamental nature of    the problems confronted by the EU and, if continued to be pursued, will actually    <i>worsen</i> those problems. To be able to get hold of its deeper problems    of legitimacy, declining popularity and political stagnation, the EU will need    to stop thinking sequentially and start thinking and acting adaptively.<a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a>    Adaptive action will allow for the construction of a framework for seeing, understanding    and influencing patterns in what is a complex and changeable crisis situation    which extends across several levels of analysis and which moves forward through    the interaction between interdependent and, therefore, only semi-autonomous    agents across time and space, meaning that one is confronted with 'continuous    action’ (Lichtenstein et al. 2006). In practice, this means very different responses    to the questions <i>What? So what? Now what?</i> as well as a need for constant    evaluation and adjustment of policies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>What</i> is    essentially trying to uncover the dynamics which underpin, govern and sustain    the current patterns, in our case the crisis of the European Union. As shown,    for the EU itself, these dynamics limit themselves to the fiscal/economic crisis    of some specific countries. Yet, as outlined above, for many others the current    fiscal crisis is the <i>result of</i> &#150; and <i>sustains</i> &#150; a much    broader crisis. In fact, as shown, even some senior EU diplomats have recognized    the need for a fundamental reform of the 'EU way’ of doing things, arguing for    a political union.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whilst there are    obviously differing opinion about that <i>particular</i> conclusion, there is    a broad consensus amongst many observers that, in the words of Bittner (2010,    p. 19) the EU is doing 'small things too big and big things too small.’ In the    words of one other observer, 'the EU focusses on small things because it is    no longer able to agree on the strategic issues it faces’.<a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In basic terms,    the European Union no longer knows what it is for, it no longer has any clear    sense of why it actually exists and, crucially, why it <i>should</i> exist.    In practical terms, there is, clearly, a desire on the part of the EU and most    of its member states to, for instance, save the single currency and sustain    the single market. However, for some countries, such as the UK &#150; this appears    to be an end in itself in order to preserve stability and the advantages that    the single market brings. For those, however, who see them as part of something    bigger, as something <i>normative</i>, it seems increasingly difficult to make    a coherent connection between those projects and the broader strategic aims    of the European Union. As already touched upon above, this problem has even    been recognized by some senior EU officials but has not been addressed coherently    by the organization as a whole. In terms of <i>what</i> do we see when one looks    at the EU today, then, it is an organization which is drifting; in permanent    crisis mode unable to face the future.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This leads one    to the second part of the <i>what</i> question: What has led to &#150; and caused    &#150; the emergence of the current pattern? In practical terms, as was already    discussed earlier, it seems clear that the set-up of the institutional and political    arrangements of monetary union, its governance structures, were inadequate to    deal with the complexities inherent in a currency union between very different    sovereign states. However, this underlines the fact that the way the European    Union 'does things', as a general rule, has also been inadequate. As shown above,    Greece's participation in monetary union, for instance, was an almost entirely    political, as opposed to an economic, decision. It was seen as politically more    convenient to have Greece inside rather than outside 'the club'. As such, one    of the factors which led to the current pattern of crisis was a lack of political    will to take hard decisions, a lack, if one likes, of political <i>resilience</i>    in the face of tough political choices, coming back to the problem of lack of    leadership already touched upon above. In fact, it could be argued that the    unwillingness or unpreparedness to take big and hard decisions (such as leaving    a willing member state out of the currency union, for example) are signs of    a lack of confidence and/or conviction in the strength of one's own project.    The EU has become an organization where 'muddling through’ is a way of avoiding    hard decisions rather than the result of pursing a clear strategic objective    within a complex environment, a small but critical difference.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In many ways it    could be argued that this lack of political resilience is the result of the    extraordinary success of the EU over the decades both in political and economic    terms and, therefore, the lack of urgency in constantly re-asking the <i>why</i>    question. Politically, it is now inconceivable that any major European countries    would go to war with one another. For European leaders from Monnet and Schuman    to Mitterand and Kohl, this was the key point of European integration. For today’s    generation of leaders it is <i>normal</i>. Economically, too, Europeans, at    least, <i>had</i> come to view prosperity, low inflation etc. as <i>normal</i>.    In fact, in some countries one could even make a direct link between EU membership    and economic prosperity, such as in Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece, coincidentally    some of the same countries that are now suffering the worst economic crises.    In the case of Ireland, for instance, Barnes (2009) has pointed out that 'the    economic performance since the mid-1990s had been remarkable: GDP per capita    growth averaged close to 5% from 1995 to 2007'. Finally, the long-standing success    of the EU also entrenched an institutional pattern of leadership by elites.    For decades, the European Union essentially relied on <i>passive</i> legitimacy,    that is, acceptance by the population of decisions taken by 'Brussels' as Dinan    (2004), amongst others, has shown. This worked for as long as things were going    well but - and here the specific <i>economic</i> crisis has had a significant    magnifying impact - is now being openly challenged by some which, as shown,    has put considerable strain on the assumptions upon which European integration    has always been based, such as solidarity. Schmitter (2012) even argued that    all these issues pointed the way towards European disintegration. Within this    context, there has also been a renewed debate about the supposed 'democratic    deficit’ at the heart of the European Union, as Sutherland (2012) has shown.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A lot more could    be said on all of these issues.However, even this very cursory look shows that,    far from being an economic crisis, asking <i>what</i> the current patterns of    European integration are and represent shows that there have been significant    changes to these patterns and, I would argue, an <i>erosion</i> of many of them.    In basic terms, the 'European condition’ of peace and prosperity in the Post-War    period was seen as permanent and, almost, automatic. As such, the basis for    European integration was not questioned or challenged or significantly renewed.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, clearly, perspectives    on European integration <i>have</i> changed, just as the circumstances within    which the process takes place, have changed. What has not been done is to adapt    the European Union strategically to these changes.This brings us to the second    question: <i>So what (does it mean)?</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In very basic terms,    and following on from the paragraph above, the European Union, apart from facing    a particular economic crisis, is also confronting a considerable strategic vacuum.    Its propensity to think sequentially means that it has no answer to one critical    question the author once put to one national ambassador of an EU member state:    <i>why</i> solve the crisis? The answer given was revealing. The ambassador    talked about the need to work jointly between member states to boost employment,    to sharpen up the rules of the single currency, to bring public finances under    control and about the need to save the single currency because the consequences    of it failing would be unknowable but potentially catastrophic for the European    Union.<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, these are    all particular answers for the particular economic problems. They reveal fear    rather than a positive vision, enhancing the negative feedback which the EU    has been receiving and generating. If there is no common vision, something which    holds the block together, why not let Greece leave the euro in order to allow    it to devalue its currency to get the economy going again? Why not, consequently,    let other countries that so whish leave the euro, giving them the freedom to    set their own interest rates?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Doing such things,    obviously, has considerable risks simply because it has not been tried before.    Whilst there are (weak) rules for governing the entry of countries into the    euro and their behavior once inside the single currency, few to no provisions    were made for governing the exit of a country from the single currency, as B&ouml;ll    et al. (2012) have shown. It would, therefore, be a journey into the unknown.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, in the    absence of a vision &#150; some kind of idea about where the EU wants to go    and why it is worth preserving and persisting with &#150; the vacuum is filled    by euro-skeptic voices pointing to the obvious problems large parts of the population    are experiencing, pinning blame on the EU and her policies and offering simplistic    but, on the face of it, attractive solutions to the crisis. One can see such    patterns in Greece, in Italy and, in general terms, a steady rise of euro-skeptic    parties across large parts of the European Union who are using the economic    crisis to advance long-held broader arguments against the EU. Crucially, though,    as Taggart and Szczerbiak (2013) have shown, this process began before the onset    of the current economic crisis, pointing, once again, to the deeper roots of    the current EU malaise.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>So, what</i>    the European Union is confronting is a problem which the vacuum at the heart    of its own thinking is reinforcing and perpetuating: the erosion of the common    ground which has held the organization and its member states together over the    decades. Instead, what are coming steadily to the fore are the <i>differences</i>    that co-exist within the EU: between member states, between member states and    EU institutions, between the different EU institutions, between different actors    within these particular institutions etc. Over the decades, these differences    have always existed and have indeed been necessary to allow for the EU to advance    and adapt, as Geyer (2003) has shown, yet these differences always existed within    the context of a clear aim, a clear and shared purpose about what European integration    was about and what it was for, as shown above. This is currently absent because    crisis-management is the permanent state of the European Union.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>So what does    that mean</i> in practical terms?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The consequence    of this is that, progressively, individual actors, member state governments,    political parties, the media and citizens &#150; have taken to filling the strategic    void left by the EU, with the result that there seems to be now a self-reinforcing    process of erosion of patterns that also seemed a 'given’ and which have historically    underpinned the core polices of the European Union. This is particularly clear    in relation to the single market and its guarantee of freedom of movement of    people, as Pascouau (2012) has pointed out. For instance, Denmark has taken    measures to re-introduce border controls in certain cases, undermining the freedom    of movement of European citizens. The UK government is pushing for a re-negotiation    of its membership terms and has also identified freedom of movement as a key    area of concern, something that even actors within the institutional structure    of the EU are now accepting as legitimate. As already mentioned, in several    countries, anti-EU parties now receive considerable numbers of votes, with the    potential to influence government policy. Responding to this, several governments,    including of traditionally pro-European countries such as the Netherlands, have    started 'audits’ of what the European Union does, arguing for a radical re-orientation    of its activities, normally meaning doing less, leaving more to member states    to determine individually. In fact, a summary of the Dutch government’s recommendations    done by EUobserver (2013) came to a full 20 pages.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not to    say that an audit of EU activities would necessarily be a bad thing. For instance,    what Cameron (2013) essentially argued was that the EU, to make itself relevant    again in the world and in relation to its own citizens, should focus on its    core activities, which he defined as the Eurozone's governance structures, European    competitiveness, the single market and, as such, 'the gap between the EU and    its citizens'. Cameron therefore made a specific connection between the Eurozone    crisis and the crisis of the EU, which he defined both in practical (economic)    terms and in terms of legitimacy, precisely some of the arguments put forward    in this article. Crucially, however, he is using these problems to argue for    a scaling-back of European integration. Those <i>not</i> in favor of such a    refocusing of EU activities therefore need to <i>engage</i> with such an argument    and develop a positive counter-argument. This has, so far, not occurred though    it is to be hoped that audits and speeches such as Cameron’s will at least kick-start    a debate around such questions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In short, the European    Union is confronting a progressively unfavorable landscape on which to re-establish    its legitimacy and, therefore, its political influence. In order to do so, however,    it will need to adapt its approach and, crucially, its objectives.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now what (can we    do)?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Everything that    has been said so far leads to one firm conclusion: the EU has to radically re-define    of the crisis it is facing. This crisis will not end if and when the Eurozone    crisis 'ends’ and the economic situation stabilizes since it is only <i>one</i>    part of a much broader picture. The EU, therefore, <i>has</i> to stop thinking    in narrow, economic terms and it <i>has</i> to stop thinking sequentially. The    reason it will not be able to <i>first</i> solve the economic crisis and <i>then</i>    the political one is because, as I hope to have shown, both interact with &#150;    and sustain one another in complex and interdependent ways. As such, they are    both part of the same general <i>pattern</i> that currently underpins the European    Union.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The objective of    European Union action has to be to change this general pattern through specific    interventions. To do so in a way which <i>enhances</i> rather than undermines    the coherence of its integration process it has to re-think its approach to    change. As shown above, the EU is currently operating in a classic top-down    way. It tells those countries in the most severe economic difficulties what    they have to do in order to receive support. It has also defined an 'ideal’    state towards which it wants to take these countries in terms of debt-reduction    and public sector reform. This has, as we have seen, led to significant public    resistance and a further erosion of the general consensus which has sustained    the EU over the years, underlining again the interdependent nature between the    Eurozone and the EU crisis. The result is that the EU is trying to solve a short-term    crisis without having defined clear long-term goals.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a first step,    therefore, the EU has to take the lead in a broad debate about its long-term    objective. As shown, several countries are individually beginning a process    of re-defining what they want European integration to be. It is critical that    the EU takes a key role in these debates and begins to shape them. It has to    a<i>ct</i> rather than <i>react</i>. Bearing in mind the complex nature of the    EU structure, this in itself will not be a smooth process (nor should it be)    but the organization needs to have a debate about what it wants to be.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Doing so will allow    the European Union to do another key thing: de-centralize. As shown above, even    within the confines of the economic crisis, 'every case is a case’, that is    to say, each case has its own particularities which depend critically on particular    local circumstances. It is, therefore, critical that local actors be allowed    to respond to the local boundary conditions they encounter.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This approach is    equally valid for the broader question of the future of the EU. As shown above,    the EU often currently takes decisions on micro-matters largely because it is    unable to agree on the important strategic matters. As one Italian observer    of EU affairs once put it to the author: 'Why does the EU have to regulate hunting    in Italy'<a name="top19"></a><a href="#back19"><sup>19</sup></a> It tries (but    fails) to be a micromanager rather than being a strategic leader which, in turn,    undermines public support for it by being seen to 'interfere’ in essentially    national issues, a key issue which also informed the Dutch 'audit’ already referred    to above.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within a broadly    defined strategic objective, the EU then can, and should, encourage the emergence    of different approaches and policies across time and space in pursuit of this    clearly defined broad strategic objective. Some authors, such as Acemoglu and    Robinson (2012) call this a process of 'creative destruction’ but in many ways    it simply means the encouragement of experimentation and learning: what works    where, when, how and why?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This leads to a    third key issue: de-centralization and adaptation are critical simply because    the <i>outcome</i> of any given policy-process is unknowable. Therefore, learning    is a critical pre-requisite for correcting possible mistakes or possible unintended    outcomes or consequences. As such, both the policies in respect of the economic    crisis and the debates about the future of the European Union as a whole are    not moving towards a pre-determined end-point. What is needed is continuous    adjustment of an ongoing process. The EU therefore has to continuously ask <i>questions</i>    about how this process is progressing. It should <i>not</i> pretend to have    all the answers. 'How can we improve the current pattern of integration at European    level’ is an infinitely more productive way of engaging the various interested    stakeholders than saying 'you <i>have</i> to follow us to this point because    <i>only</i> this option will work’, as has been done in relation to Greece,    for example.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Now what can    we do</i>, as a question, therefore, refers much more to the type of <i>process</i>    that is being used in order to address particular problems than coming up with    definitive answers. Since the EU is a highly complex social system which evolves    through the interaction of interdependent (and hence semi-autonomous) agents    across time and space and several levels of analysis, it is an illusion to think    that the <i>exact</i> outcome of any given policy process and/or process of    implementation can be controlled. There is too much uncertainty. As such, the    EU has to adopt a posture of <i>continuous inquiry</i>, embedded within a clear    context of strategic objectives without which there would be no purpose to the    inquiry.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>VI . Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The aim of this    text has been to show that the crisis the EU is currently facing is far broader    than the immediate economic crisis of the Eurozone and some of its member states    in particular. It has been argued that the organization is also facing a strategic    crisis in the sense that it does not know where it is going or what it wants    to be. Critically, in the absence of such strategic objectives, it is much,    much harder to solve the immediate crisis since there is no clear sense as to    <i>why</i> that crisis should be solved within the context of the European Union.    The strategic crisis of the EU and the particular crisis of the Eurozone are,    therefore, intimately linked and sustain one another.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It has also been    shown that, in the absence of a strategic objective and a clear sense of why    the European Union exists, public support for &#150; and the foundations of    &#150; the process of European integration erode. This process has been accelerated    &#150; but not started &#150; by the current economic crisis.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to begin    to address these problems this work has presented the concept of <i>adaptive    action</i> and applied it to the EU and its current situation. Asking the question    <i>what, so what</i> and <i>now what</i>, it has been shown that the European    Union needs to think of its development as an ongoing process of questioning,    learning and adjusting in order to change the patterns that underpin the process    of integration. Asking such questions and standing in permanent inquiry would    allow the EU to act as a strategic leader rather than the overloaded micromanager    it is trying to be at the moment. The aim needs to be to make the EU politically    more resilient than it has proven to be so far.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question of    how to create a politically more resilient EU will require a lot more work and    research. Ways will have to be found to make the institutional framework more    flexible in the face of severe crises and more alert to the warning signs of    a coming crisis, i.e. signs that point to an erosion of the existing patterns    sustaining integration. To do so, it may well be necessary to do an 'audit’    of EU activities of the type that several national governments are currently    conducting. However, it is essential that the EU lead such a debate rather than    follow it and that, again, such an audit be guided by some clear principles.    As has been argued, such principles should include a commitment to de-centralization,    as well as a focus on the 'big’ issues which can and will make a positive difference    to people’s lives rather than the current obsession with regulating lots of    small issues that can perfectly well be dealt with at national or even local    level.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of this may    and should eventually lead to dealing with the biggest issue of all: why should    the European Union still exist in the 21<sup>st</sup> century? It seems a simple    question, but a clear answer is needed as a matter of urgency.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Acemoglu, D.; Robinson,    J.A. 2012. <i>Why Nations Fail: The origins of power, prosperity and poverty</i>.

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the performance of 110 second-grade public school children in reading and writing words and texts and the teachers judgement of such skills. Significant correlations between students performance and teachers perception of these skills were found. The teachers assessment of students reading competence at the end of the academic year proved to be a crucial factor in establishing the differences of students performance. Although some positive correlations were found, there were some discrepancies between the teachers judgement and the evaluations. The study suggests that the teacher has the knowledge that enables him/her to rate the reading and writing skills of his/her students in a way that is related to students performance, from the point of view of an evaluation based on cognitive psychology.

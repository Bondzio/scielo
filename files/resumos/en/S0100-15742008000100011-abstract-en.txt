This article discusses the inclusion/exclusion of students in chemistry classrooms based on singular histories. These histories were constructed from a set of data that includes interviews, socio-economic and cultural questionnaires, classroom observation and video data taken from one teaching sequence in two high schools from Belo Horizonte. The data of a sample of students are present by means of contrast between pair of students, aiming at highlight how their inclusion/exclusion processes were constructed. These contrasts are based on the school history of the students, their ethnic, social class and gender backgrounds as well as on the social interactions in classrooms and in small group activities, registered in video. Through the contrasts and the analysis of events and discursive sequences we observed that the inclusion/exclusion processes are not given from the outset. Instead, they are constructed in the day to day life of the classrooms and are articulated with the socio-economic and cultural backgrounds of the students and with their school history. In addition, to be included in the classroom it is necessary to learn chemistry and to establish a relationship with knowledge that is always personal, singular and depends on the comprehension of a specific language and on the construction of leaning opportunities for all the students. In this construction we have identified the fundamental role of the teachers as mediators by means of a variety of methodological strategies for teaching chemistry and guidance of the students' work in small groups and in the whole classroom.

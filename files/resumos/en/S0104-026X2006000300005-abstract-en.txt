The goals of this article are to contextualize the ambiance in which the access of women in the Military College of Rio de Janeiro was observed, in 1989, and to identify and analyze masculine and feminine representations on the academic and sporting insertion of the first group of women in the school. The research was oriented by the approach of social representations, following Moscovici and Wagner. Data come from the analysis of magazines and newspapers related to the theme, from 1988 to 1996, and from six elite interviews held with three formal students and three teachers. It was concluded that the treatment offered to female students by teachers and colleagues was careful and protective. The support, guaranteed by the commander and a female teacher of physical education, influenced and consolidated the space for female participation and integration in the academic and sporting life of Military College.

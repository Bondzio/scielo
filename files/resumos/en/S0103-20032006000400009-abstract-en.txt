The breeding of ovine and caprine possess high partner-economic importance in the Northeast, however, the low genetic potential of the herds, as well as the scarcity of pastures during the dry season, limits the productivity and lucrativeness indices to a low level. The use of cultivated pastures is a way to maintain in high level the carrying capacity of the pasture over the year. This work was conducted with the aim of increase the productivity, expand the income and stimulate the producer to invest in new productive techniques. 100 Sem Ra√ßa Definida sheep and three periods were used. The rest period consisted of: treatment 1 - time for expansion of 1.5 new leaves per tiller; treatment 2 - time for expansion of 2.5 new leaves per tiller and treatment 3 - time for expansion of 3.5 new leaves per tiller. The analysis considered the use of 1, 3 or 5 hectares of pasture, fenced by campestre screen or electric fence. The efficiency indices adopted were: benefit cost relation, liquid present value, return internal tax, and sensitivity analysis. The 2.5 leaves rest period exploring at least 5.0 hectares presented best performance, in terms economics, biological and environmental. So, to promote economic return, it is necessary to use sheep of higher genetic potential and pastures areas above 5.0 hectares.

This essay is about the new trends on Chilean feminisms and how they have become part of the social text. The paper discusses how feminist discourses after dictatorship (1973-1990) remain without putting into question the category of "women" as a generalization that erases class and racial differences among women. This is analyzed in the context of the compromise made by Chilean democratic governments with the interests of oligarchy and the Catholic Church in order to maintain the status quo. Part of this compromise has constrained feminist discourses to the nuclear family frame, within which class, race and sexuality cannot be fully problematized. Since Chilean feminists are not questioning their place of enunciation, problems such as reproductive rights or women access to the public space continue to be seen from a privileged perspective that obliterates the existing discriminations among women.

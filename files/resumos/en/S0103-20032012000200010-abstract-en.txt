In this paper we establish entrepreneurship characteristics and motivational dimension by gender. Analyzing a representative sample of rural tourism establishments of the Autonomous Community of Galicia (Spain), we seek behavioural differences between gender holders. Relationship is found between gender and reconciliation and importance of agricultural activities by owner, and between gender and profile of the motivations to start tourism activity. Female entrepreneurs are more motivated by elements in the economic sphere and, therefore, have a greater role in decision-making rational economic criteria and diversification of agriculture.

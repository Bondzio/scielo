Abstract: The hypothesis of this research is based on the existence of a tension between violence and love during the first dating relationships of heterosexual middle-class young people, from Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA). In order to address this hypothesis, a theoretical and methodological proposal that allows to problematize and interrelate both concepts is developed. Afterwards, in the light of that perspective, the work analyzes both scenes of violence that are framed, from the perspective of the actors, inside a record of game and love, and scenes that allows to visualize the passage from moments of fight to moments of pleasure within the couple.

ABSTRACT  Introduction Through a critical review of recent literature, the essay explores the relationship between contentious protest and authoritarian regimes and examines the dynamics and consequences that emerge during the political conflict.  Methods three elements that scholars have identified as key in this relationship are discussed: the political opportunities and threats, cycles of protest and the sustainability of the social movements, and the relationship between state violence and collective action.  Results Recurrence of protest in repressive regimes shows the ability of civil society to articulate these contentious actions.  Discussion However, paths and results depend, on the one hand, on the political features of the regime and on the competence of the government to respond to collective challenges; and, on the other hand, on the ability of opponents to mount cycles of protest that are dense in participation during a significant period, the type of tactics adopted, and the adaptability and resilience to the State violence.

The present contribution deals with the meaning of the feminine leadership from a masculine perspective. By using a qualitative approach, open interviews were developed to understand the meaning that men assign to the feminine leadership. The speeches were analyzed on the basis of the Strauss/Corbin-theory (2003). The results show that men agree with the changes experienced by the gender roles. In a specific way, men agree that women need to have more societal-economic opportunities, which are necessary for more equitable relationship inside the family. However, within this positive framework emerging tensions configure a dissatisfaction of the masculinity that, in turn, impact the intimate sphere questioning the present day inter-gender relationship. Finally, there is a men's group with more progressive speeches which venture towards a positive evaluation of the women's capacities and their assumed public space-roles. However this positive evaluation is vigilant, ambivalent, and influenced by a perception of confidence/uncertainty, efficiency/inefficiency of the effective societal contribution that women are able to reach.

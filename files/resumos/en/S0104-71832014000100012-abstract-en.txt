This paper examines how two global processes (land grabbing and conservation policies) are involved in the dynamics of social reproduction of the inhabitants of a national park in Uruguay. Both scales can be brought into play the different naturalisms categorized by Descola. Harvey's idea of accumulation by dispossession, realizes this phase of expansion of capitalism on the "commons" whose central feature is the degradation and natural resource depletion. Meanwhile the implementation of conservation policies in this context consolidates dual landscapes (some dedicated to the preservation of nature and others to indiscriminate exploitation). The analysis allows us to discuss the unsustainability of the dominant social relations, as well as various sizes and scales of analysis bring complexity of the understanding of local and combined effects of these two global phenomena.

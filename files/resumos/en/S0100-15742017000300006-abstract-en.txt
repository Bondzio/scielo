ABSTRACT This paper discusses the links among study, work and family for higher education students based on the results of a broader research carried out at the Universidade Federal de Goi√°s (BR). Based on a sample of 527 students, this work seeks to characterize them according to their sense of belonging and social positions, their use of time and, also, the participation of men and women in productive and reproductive work. The analysis indicates that although young women make up the majority of the population, the hierarchical structures of gender relations persist and the responsibility for domestic work is still overwhelmingly assumed by women.

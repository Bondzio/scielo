The aim of this article is to analyze the extent to which the 2013 demonstrations in our country differ, both politically and in organizational terms, from the great demonstrations of the 20th century. How the relationship between organized social movements and demonstrations occurred in both historical moments. In view of the many agendas in recent demonstrations, from desires for changes in the social, cultural, and political systems, to demands for institutionalizing new human rights and expanding public policies, we analyzed the sharing and articulating that produced some unity or identification in politics. We conclude that the protests, both in relation to the institutional field of politics and to the insufficiencies in the field of human rights, were relevant for a subjectivation that might explain the common presence in the streets of social actors with different political orientations.

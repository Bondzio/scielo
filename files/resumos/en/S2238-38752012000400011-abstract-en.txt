Abstract: In this interview, Richard Handler, one of the editors of the works of the linguist and anthropologist Edward Sapir, focuses on the importance of this work and its influence on his own work as a cultural anthropologist, and situates Sapir&#8217;s ideas in the context of the North American anthropological tradition and the American artistic and literary modernism at the first decades of the 20th century. Handler stresses the permanence of these ideas in the history of American Anthropology and their relevance for the present anthropological discussions.

The political design of the Chilean social system has been unable to solve the endemic problems of social inequality that characterize it, showing thereby a deep crisis not only of the educational system but also of the social and economic system, which requires a systemic design different, of which there is no indication yet that it is feasible. Despite the effort expended, the educational results show a strong link with the social origin and economic status of families, i.e., the differences in initial social and cultural capital are not reduced, adjusted or reversed significantly by the regular educational system. The problem lies in the fact that education has very uneven standards among different social strata, so that, even with formal similarities, at bottom, the differences are key and respond to an accumulation of "advantages" and "disadvantages", according to each case, which finally result in reproduction of intergenerational social inequality, only duly legitimated.This reproductive circle of inequality is the new way by which the problem presents itself, no longer about "excluded and included, but about complex new forms of exclusion or inclusion, but equally effective at maintaining the inter-generational differences. The failure of the current design of the social and educational system entails viewing changes that require a change of magnitude in the design of the State, which is estimated to be complex, because, somehow, is to deny itself as a State, to give a step toward a new social pact.

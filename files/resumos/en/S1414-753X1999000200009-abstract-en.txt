This paper discusses the conceptual framework, the social roots and the perspectives of a new water resources management paradigm that is being built since the mid sixties: that of sustainable or integrated water management. Based on the rational and participatory planning of water uses within river basins, on hydric demand management, as well as on water resources conservation, this new paradigm is emerging from a critical view of the old water development predatory model that prevailed in the past.

Abstract The article deals with issues already addressed by the author and Eve Chiapello in Le nouvel esprit du capitalisme (1999), to highlight the importance of reflecting on the role and limits of criticism. While recognizing that the critical attitude has not disappeared, the author questions the power of criticism, before the so-called "managerial domination" of our days. In this case, unlike what happens with the domination by terror or by ideology, the legitimacy given by science and new management strategies and tools, support forms of governance - public or private - that prevent criticism and maintain unchanged the major existing social asymmetries.

Traditional communities located along the banks of the river Madeira are influenced by their close relationship to nature and their extensive empirical knowledge of its cycles. Fish is the main resources exploited for both subsistence and trade. This study evaluated the socioeconomic profile and fishing activity in two riverbank communities, located on the middle reaches of the river Madeira, SÃ£o Carlos e Calama. A semi structured interview had been applied a one member of each family of fishermen from these communities, between April and August/2009, total 189 respondents. The question included the number of fishermen by family, schooling, age, how long they had been fishing, to which if any association they belonged to, commercial strategies, other commercial activities and average monthly income in respect of each activity. Through collective meetings with fishermen information regarding the knowledge Ecologic Local was obtained in respect of species, environments and conflicts together with present scenarios. The results indicated that fishermen from both sites have an average age of 39 years and actively fishing for an average of 20 years, with fishermen of. More than 60% have not completed elementary school. The main conflicts are related to fiscalization considered inappropriate and lack of fishery space. The construction of maps of scenarios showed an expectation of an increase in conflict attributed to a reduction of fishing areas and the possible migration of resettled fishermen after the implantation of UHEs. The knowledge generated constitutes a first study into social aspects involving fishing within these areas and can complement management of fisheries resources by ensuring their sustainability.

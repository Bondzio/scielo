Abstract A review of the history and contemporary use of the terms &#8220;epigenesis&#8221;, coined by Aristotle, and &#8220;epigenetics&#8221;, proposed by the biologist C. H. Waddington in the 20th century, brings to light the tensions between the vitalist and mechanist &#8211; or epigenist and preformationist &#8211; competing tendencies in life sciences in Western culture since the 17th century. Epigenetics involves intense discussions about the limits of neo-darwinism, opening space for the influence of the &#8220;environment&#8221; in transgenerational transmission. These tensions and polemics are of great interest for the humanities, since they imply different roles for &#8220;natural&#8221; heritage in mental, social and cultural life through the development and actualization of humanity.

This article presents a theoretical reflection of sociological themes involved in the debate on rurality and environmental regulation in contemporary societies. The paper discusses the notions of territory and rural development, starting from a political-institutional focus, attempting to locate the contexts of localities within wide nets of social reproduction. The paper's central argument emphasizes the importance of studies which insert the local power structures in the understanding of territorial dynamics.

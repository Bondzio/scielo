Departing from the entry on Postfeminism in the Dicionário da Crítica Feminista (edited by Ana Gabriela Macedo and Ana Luísa Amaral), I discuss the meaning of the concept not in isolation, but in affiliation with other concepts which somehow help to understand the complexity of this debate, e.g., Counter-feminism, Postmodernism, Counter-diction, Difference; Body; Image; Gynocritics, Cyberfeminism. I defend that despite all odds, Feminism still stands as a fundamental "counter-diction," a much needed oppositional discourse in our day and age.

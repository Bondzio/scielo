Embora existam importantes benef&iacute;cios para ambos os lados   da rela&ccedil;&atilde;o, eu alego que o G-77 tamb&eacute;m sofre desvantagem sob v&aacute;rias formas   concretas por parte dos pa&iacute;ses do BASIC.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Palavras-chave:</b> BASIC; mudan&ccedil;a clim&aacute;tica; G-77.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Twenty years have passed   since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was   opened for signature at the first Rio Conference on Environment and Development   in 1992. Most observers agree that over those two decades, multilateral   negotiations on climate change have become "ossified," "gridlocked," and   otherwise unlikely to produce meaningful results in the near future (Depledge   2006; Dimitrov 2010; Victor 2011). The line between the developed North and the   developing South is often seen as the fault line of disagreement in those   negotiations, although neither side has ever been homogeneous. This article   takes up the question of whether differentiation in the South is now sharp   enough that the basic North/South framework is no longer useful for   understanding global environmental governance. It also asks whether   fragmentation of the South is likely to diminish or enhance Southern influence   in environmental negotiations, especially negotiations on addressing climate   change.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The article updates earlier influential works on the   role of the Group of 77 (G-77) in global environmental governance, with the   G-77 being the coalition of developing countries that has been "functionally   the negotiating arm of the developing countries' collective" for almost 50   years (Najam 2005, 307; see also Williams 2005).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> The G-77's role is   being redefined as it negotiates alongside an increasingly crowded field of   coalitions (Roberts 2011), with some of those new collective voices rising out   of the G-77 itself. Notably, four of the largest and/or fastest growing   developing states &#150; Brazil, China, India, and South Africa &#150; joined together   for the first time as the BASIC group in Copenhagen in 2009.     I pay special attention to this group, asking how the rise of the BASIC   coalition affects the status of the G-77 and its members' ability to achieve   their central goals in the negotiations: a seat at the table and resources to   support their sustainable development aspirations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I begin with a brief introduction to the two main   coalitions of interest, the G-77 and the BASIC countries. In the next sections,   I use the groups' documents to illustrate how BASIC members explain their   motivations in climate negotiations and their relationship to the G-77. I   examine the empirical evidence for how the BASIC countries may be affecting the   ability of their G-77 partners to achieve the latter's aims, concluding that   they advance some aims while detracting from others.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The G-77, BASIC, and   their ambitions for global     environmental governance</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the decolonization wave that brought many new   states into existence in the 1950s&#150;1970s, the developing countries of the world   have tried to maintain solidarity in international negotiations. Labels like   the "South," the "Third World," or "developing countries" insist on their   essential similarity, at least in opposition to the developed "North." The G-77   has been the institutional manifestation of that collective identity in many   international settings, including climate negotiations. Studies of the G-77   have identified key dimensions of the institution and the aims it has pursued   in the environmental arena, and I survey those here. The BASIC group is newer   and less familiar, so I also briefly present its history. </font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The G-77 </font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The G-77 began in 1964 to give a voice to demands for   a New International Economic Order within the UN. Seventy-seven countries   formed the original group, and the name Group of 77 continues even though the   group now has more than 130 members. In addition to its new members, the G-77   has also lost some members over the years. For example, Mexico and the Republic   of Korea withdrew from the G-77 when they entered the Organization of Economic   Cooperation and Development (OECD). Member states of the G-77 meet to   coordinate their positions and a rotating chair (the position rotates between   Africa, Asia, and Latin America) speaks for the group in international   negotiations and to the press.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any group of 130 countries will have many differences   and the G-77 is no exception. The South has always been politically and   economically heterogeneous. Given this diversity, it is striking that through   the mid-2000s, observers were readily able to identify a common set of concerns   that the G-77 could represent in global negotiations. For some analysts, these   common concerns were based on a structural division between North and South, rooted   in different material realities and historical experiences (e.g. Miller 1995;   Roberts and Parks 2007). For others, the South's collective action was based   less on objective facts than on members' willingness to adopt a collective   identity (e.g. Najam 2005, 306; Williams 2005, 51&#150;53). Williams makes this   argument most strongly, arguing "...the <b>construction</b> of a North-South divide is an integral part of the bargaining process..."   (Williams 2005, 57, my emphasis). Finally, some maintain that G-77 and BASIC   unity are strongly grounded in their constructed collective identities, but   there are material bases for their unity as well (Vihma, Mulugetta, and   Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen 2011). Whatever the foundation of their collective status,   what aims has the G-77 most consistently pursued in international negotiating   sessions?</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A founding purpose   of the G-77 was for more influential participation in global governance in   order to address the shared "poverty of influence" (Najam 2005, 305) of this   "imagined community of the powerless and vulnerable" (Williams 2005, 55; see   also Barnett 2008). This sense of vulnerability has two sides. In one, the   concern is about the G-77 members' lack of positive influence on the   substantive outcomes of international negotiations while, in the other, the   concern is to limit incursions into their national sovereignty and their   ability to make their own choices about their development strategies (Kasa,   Gullberg, and Heggelund 2008, 118). Both considerations require more effective   participation in international negotiations. New, weak, and poor countries saw   themselves as systematically disadvantaged in global negotiations compared to   developed countries that brought large delegations of technically and   politically experienced negotiators to global meetings. Not only did the North   know how to maneuver through the rules of international bargaining &#150; Northern   countries had set up the rules. Yet bilateral negotiations were often even   worse for individual developing states. By arguing for multilateral decision-making   in the UN and then banding together in the G-77, Southern states could better   share their experience and personnel and gain negotiation leverage. Ultimately,   they want to help set up any new rules.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first aim for   more effective participation is a means to the second, primary aim: the G-77   wants its global participation to enhance the national development of its   member states. In broad terms, this is a concern with poverty alleviation and   economic growth in their economies as a whole. Development also includes a   concern with capacity building for both negotiations and implementation of any   international agreements. All of these require transfers of financial resources   and technology from the North, including more specifically for mitigation of   and adaptation to climate change in the climate regime (Vihma, Mulugetta, and   Karlsson-Vinkuyzen 2011, 326; Williams 2005, 56). Beyond these general terms,   members of the G-77 want to make their own development choices, and the group   on principle makes few specific demands about development paths (Kasa,   Gullberg, and Heggelund 2008). Over time, the G-77 has moved away from a strong   stance that assumes that greater environmental protection is incompatible with   its development goals, accepting the aim of sustainable development, although   G-77 member states have defined the effectiveness and legitimacy of   international environmental agreements in terms of whether they result in   development outcomes like poverty reduction (Najam 2005). Because this is such a   complex and multifaceted aim, below I look only at the recent politics of   development assistance and technology transfer, especially in the climate   negotiations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To conclude, the G-77 is a diverse coalition of most   of the developing countries. Since 1964, its member states have negotiated   together for two broad aims: first, to achieve greater influence in   international negotiations and reduce their individual and collective   vulnerability, and second, to use their international participation to improve   their national development outcomes. Members of the G-77 have assumed that they   can come closer to these aims if they present themselves in international   negotiations as an undifferentiated set of actors whose similarities outweigh   their differences &#150; whatever the material reality.</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The BASIC coalition </font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even as the G-77 asserted (and asserts) the similarity   of its members, some countries in the G-77 coalition have had notably different   development outcomes than others. China stands out, to take an obvious example.   Remarkably high growth rates for a remarkably long period of time have brought   it to standing among the world's very largest economies, a "G-2" with the   United States in some domains (Beeson 2009; Foot 2006). While no country   matches China's rise, other emerging powers share some combination of its large   size, rapid economic growth rates, and increasing international stature   (Alexandroff and Cooper 2010; Armijo 2007; Hallding, Olsson, Atteridge, Vihma,   Carson, and Rom&aacute;n 2011; Viola 2010). In November 2009, just before the   Copenhagen meeting on global climate change, four of those emerging powers   joined to coordinate their positions in the BASIC coalition of Brazil, China,   India, and South Africa. The environmental ministers of BASIC have met   quarterly since November 2009 to coordinate their participation in the   negotiations. They issue Joint Statements at the end of each meeting, which   report that they also use the meetings to share successful experiences and to   work through key concepts like equity.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The four countries of the BASIC coalition illustrate   that the concept of "emerging power" is a "family resemblance" comparative   category. That is, they share a set of material features that are commonly   analytically associated with being an emerging power, but each has a somewhat   different set of the attributes (Collier and Mahon 1993, 847). China and India   share the distinction of having had very fast economic growth rates for the   last decade or more, while Brazil and South Africa are closer to the global average.   Brazil, China, and India are among the top ten of the world's very largest   economies, while South Africa is two deciles lower. Given the much larger   populations of China and India, however, the South African GDP per capita (PPP)   is close to that of Brazil's, while China's is only two-thirds the size and   India only one-third. In fact, Brazil matched India's current GDP per capita   (PPP) back in 1981.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> All are considered regional powers,   although China and India are neighbors and so cannot both be in any   straightforward sense. This pattern extends to the climate area, where all of   the four are increasingly important current contributors of greenhouse gases   (GHG), but China and India contribute through increasingly-high aggregate   emissions while Brazil and South Africa are higher in per capita terms (Viola   2010).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The BASIC coalition has been a very active collective   participant in the Copenhagen negotiations, working with the US to negotiate   the controversial Copenhagen Accord that called for voluntary reductions in   greenhouse gas emissions rather than the mandatory reductions many participants   expected. Its ministers have met quarterly ever since. Other countries &#150; and   especially Northern ones &#150; treat the BASIC group as a separate unit within   negotiations. Yet the BASIC countries have taken pains to underscore that they   continue to remain a part of the G-77 coalition, inviting the current president   of the G-77 to all of their meetings and insisting in the Durban negotiations   of 2011 that the G-77 represented their positions in the meetings. In the   remainder of this article, I examine the BASIC/G-77 relationship in greater   detail, focusing on the question of the BASIC coalition's impact on the ability   of the remainder of the G-77 to meet its primary aims in international   environmental governance.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Participation and international environmental   negotiations</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the most important historic commonalities among   the members of the G-77 is a sense that they have been excluded from equal   participation in global negotiations. More fundamentally, G-77 members have not   helped to set up the rules for international institutions and events. The large   regional powers among the BASIC countries, in contrast, have drawn increasing   international attention and can play something of a veto role in global   negotiations and rule-making, even if they cannot necessarily assert a positive   agenda (Hurrell and Sengupta 2012). In this section, I provide evidence of that   larger role in the climate negotiations, and ask about its effect on the rest   of the G-77.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the BASIC   countries have grown in prominence over the last 15 years or so, they have   sought and been given increasingly central roles in global governance   (Alexandroff and Cooper 2010; Armijo 2007; Hallding et al. 2011; Scott   2010). They have also joined in their own arrangements &#150; the IBSA of India,   Brazil and South Africa; the BRICS of the four countries plus Russia, and   others &#150; in an attempt to manage their more prominent role and coordinate their   positions for greater influence. The BASIC countries have been less anxious to   take a lead in the climate negotiations, but developed countries began to   single them out for special climate attention and participation as early as   2005. In that year, they and Mexico were the "Five" at a meeting of the G-8 +   5; this group was identified as the 13 largest greenhouse gas emitters (Hallding   et al. 2011, 32). In subsequent years, they were repeatedly invited to   appear at smaller events to discuss climate issues, such as the G-20 and the   17-member Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In these smaller meetings, the BASIC countries did   gain considerably more decision-making influence, but also received much more   pressure to take action immediately on reducing their climate emissions. In the   UNFCCC meetings, in contrast, they were able to join the G-77 as part of an   undifferentiated South that was not yet required to take climate action through   the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities. The BASIC   countries' willingness to participate in these forums indicates some openness   to discussing their emissions, and with other participants in the Major   Economies Forum in 2009 accepted the goal of keeping global warming to   2 &deg;C, an aim that would require stringent emissions reductions (Hurrell   and Sengupta 2012, 470). The four have also pushed back against the special   forums, however, insisting that the UNFCCC must be the primary venue. After the   Copenhagen negotiation in December 2009, many of the Joint Statements of their   quarterly Ministerial Meetings restated this point. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even in the UNFCCC meetings, the BASIC countries stood   out. The Copenhagen negotiations presented some of the most striking evidence   of the BASIC countries' partial separation from the G-77 and its consequences   for all these participants from the South. On the one hand, the BASIC countries   were absolutely central to the final outcome, with global newspaper coverage of   the four BASIC presidents sitting down with US President Obama to shape the   eventual Copenhagen Accord. They single-handedly removed the "legally binding"   clause from the already-weak agreement, with even the EU left out and forced to   accept their decision (Dimitrov 2010, 809&#150;810). Dimitrov, in fact, accused   China, India, and Brazil of having directly "prevented an agreement" (Dimitrov   2010, 796) of the kind he preferred, with legally-binding commitments for them   as major emitters. The BASIC countries were part of all of the small group   negotiations that reached the final conference agreement, and consulted with   each other "hourly" during the decisive days of the negotiations (Hallding   et al. 2011). Despite their leadership, Sudan as chair of the G-77   strongly resisted the Copenhagen Accord, raising especially strong procedural   objections to the fact that the documents negotiated by all countries together   were rejected in favor of an agreement of the few (Vihma, Mulugetta, and   Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen 2011, 324&#150;325). In the final discussions, Sudan (as a   country) joined with Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Tuvalu, and Venezuela   to prevent the meeting from adopting the Accord on procedural as well as substantive   grounds.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The BASIC countries were sensitive to the procedural   criticisms. In their first ministerial meeting after Copenhagen, the final   Joint Statement stressed the need for inclusive negotiations within the context   of the UNFCCC. The Joint Statement of the next, Third Meeting (April 2010), was   even more explicit: "Small groups can make a contribution in resolving   conflicts, but they must be representative and their composition must be   determined through fully inclusive and transparent negotiations, with a   mechanism for reporting back to the multilateral forum." Similar comments   continued through the next years. When South Africa hosted the Conference of   Parties in 2011, its refrain of "an open, transparent, inclusive and   party-driven process" was a mantra that actually seemed to drive procedures. In   fact, corridor complaints more often focused on the lack of smaller group   negotiations that could move negotiations faster than the full group could.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the Copenhagen meeting, the BASIC countries also   took pains to insist that they planned to remain part of the G-77 as it   negotiated within multilateral meetings, given open breaks in the G-77 in Copenhagen   and since, they have also reiterated their desire to strengthen the coalition.   In the Joint Statement of their 11<sup>th</sup> Meeting in July 2012, for   example, the BASIC Ministers wrote, "Ministers emphasized that BASIC countries,   as part of the G-77 and China, continue to work to maintain the strength and   unity of the Group. The Ministers reaffirmed the importance of the unity of the   G-77 and China as the common voice of developing countries in the climate   change negotiations." G-77 representatives have been invited to nearly all of   their Ministerial meetings, and have attended many, along with representatives   of the Least-Developed Countries and the Arab, African, and Small Island States   groups. The BASIC countries have made similar statements in other settings.   Brazilian lead negotiator Andr&eacute; Corr&ecirc;a do Lago said at Durban that "BASIC is   not a negotiation group."<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> The Chinese chief negotiator Xie   concurred during the only BASIC press briefing there, stating the BASIC   countries were developing countries and members of the G-77, and not a separate   group.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the stated intentions of BASIC countries, they   and especially China continue to gain prominence at the expense of the G-77.   The declining prominence of the G-77 in negotiations can be seen in a recent   set of surveys of participants in the climate negotiations between 2008 and   2010. While 27% of participants identified the G-77 as a leader at the 2008   Pozn&aacute;n sessions &#150; the same percentage as the United States &#150;, just 19% of   respondents thought the G-77 had been a leader in the 2010 Canc&uacute;n session,   while the US rose to 50%. Meanwhile, China was identified as a leader by 47&#150;52%   of respondents in all years. China was the most recognized as a leader with its   52% in 2010, as the European Union had dropped from 62% to 45%. More than 10%   of respondents also recognized the BASIC countries as a group and Brazil and   India individually as leaders (Karlsson, Hjerpe, Parker, and Linn&eacute;r 2012, 49).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The continued alliance of the G-77 countries is   something of a puzzle. There is no question that various groups within the G-77   have different concrete interests with respect to climate change. The   Association of Small Island States (AOSIS), the least-developed countries   (LDCs), and the African block are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate   change and have the least resources to address them. The oil producers of OPEC   see equally dire threats from an end to fossil fuel use (Barnett 2008). The   comparatively industrialized countries of BASIC are major current contributors   to greenhouse gases (although still less historically than the developed   countries) and worry about the economic impacts of climate action. The G-77   countries had remained remarkably unified despite these differences (Barnett   2008; Depledge 2006), but the Copenhagen conference saw the first open splits   among them, as some of the most vulnerable countries began to challenge the   BASIC countries to do more to reduce emissions.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nonetheless, there are also instrumental reasons for   Third World countries to continue to join together, formulating a collective   response to the North's dominance in global governance (Williams 2005, 53&#150;54).   Most observers agree that the G-77 members have a larger negotiation role with   the BASIC countries among them than they would otherwise, while the larger   BASIC countries have increased leverage from their position as leaders of the   developing world (Williams 2005, 55; Hallding et al. 2011, 29). Certainly   the BASIC countries have voiced their commitment to remain with the G-77,   describing their group as "anchored" in the G-77 (Joint Statement of the 3<sup>rd</sup> Meeting of Ministers, April 2010). In both of their 2012 meetings, they have   repeated that point: "Ministers emphasized that BASIC countries, as part of the   G-77 and China, continue to work to maintain and strengthen the unity of the   group. The Ministers reaffirmed the importance of the unity of the G-77 and   China as the common voice of developing countries in the climate change   negotiations" (Joint Statement of the 11<sup>th</sup> Meeting of Ministers,   July 2012).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The right to develop: financial resources and transfer of   technology</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Southern countries of the G-77 have historically   seen international negotiations as a place where they can pressure for assistance   in their national development, and even evaluate environmental negotiations on   these grounds (Najam 2005, 315). On the theme of financial assistance for   development, the BASIC countries and the G-77 often share the same preferences   in climate negotiations. Consequently, the greater power and visibility of the   BASIC coalition generally supports G-77 proposals in the negotiations where   they might otherwise be overwhelmed by the much stronger economic forces of   Northern countries. Once funds of various kinds are set up, however, the   interests of the two groups diverge, especially when private actors are   involved. The same factors that make the BASIC countries top recipients of   foreign direct investment &#150; they are economically dynamic, have comparatively   good infrastructure, and can manage more and larger economic projects &#150; makes   them more attractive recipients for climate funding and technology exchange, as   detailed below. The BASIC countries are aware of these problems and have made   some efforts to address them in the negotiations. Several of them have also   begun to play a modest, but novel, role as donors of technical and financial   assistance to poorer Southern countries.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As discussed above, the origin of the G-77 lies in its   members' common aspirations for national development and their conviction that   multilateral negotiations should further that aim. Yet any climate action or   inaction clashes with how some parts of the G-77 define their development   prospects. Reducing emissions is a challenge to the interests of OPEC and other   fossil fuel producers, which have insisted that some of the adaptation funds   come to it to help in its diversification from fossil fuel extraction. They   have done all they can to slow the negotiations and block action (Barnett 2008,   4; Depledge 2006, 12&#150;13). At the same time, not taking action creates   significant development challenges for LDCs and AOSIS members. LDCs'   agricultural economies and the very physical existence of small island states   depend on climate action (Barnett 2008). AOSIS and the LDCs agree with the   BASIC countries on the importance of the principle of Common but Differentiated   Responsibilities, but have begun to ask all emitters &#150; including BASIC &#150; to   assist with mitigation of climate emissions (Vihma, Mulugetta, and   Karlsson-Vinkuyzen 2011, 328). Despite this conflict of interest, all members   of the G-77 including the BASIC countries have been able to articulate some   common interests in maintaining the right to develop and seeking financial and   technological support from the North for that development.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the climate arena in particular, these general   agreements have led to a strong, shared focus on states having an equal right   to develop. The BASIC countries have framed their demands in terms of a global   carbon budget, where quotas of carbon emissions must be distributed in ways   that allow all countries the space for development. In their view, this   requires a serious and prior effort by developed countries to reduce their own   emissions so that developing countries may emit the greenhouse gases that   accompany their own development. This demand has been made in all of their   Joint Statements from the Ministerial meetings, and continues to be a   non-negotiable starting point. They have so far granted less open attention to   the arguments of others that suggest their own emissions need to be curtailed   for the development aspirations of others (e.g., Harris 2011). This point is   likely to eventually be raised in their regions, given that South Africa, for   example, has emitted 40% of all of Africa's historical greenhouse gas emissions   (Hallding et al. 2011, 56). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another element of the BASIC demands is less   potentially contentious. The BASIC countries have consistently articulated and   supported the G-77's permanent demands for more financial and technological   assistance from the North, saying that Southern mitigation and adaptation   activities depend on it. Here, the BASIC countries have tended to articulate   very similar preferences to those of the G-77 as a whole, including "opposing   donor dominance in international financial mechanisms and preferring   rights-based claims to resource transfers, rather than traditional 'assistance'" (Vihma, Mulugetta, and Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen   2011, 317). They have insisted that climate finance include new and   additional funds rather than displacing current development assistance, and   supported the G-77 preference for public, rather than private, sources of funds   that follow national (recipient) preferences. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In their first meeting after the Copenhagen   negotiations, the BASIC countries asked for early implementation of the   Copenhagen promise of US$ 30 billion of new financing per year over   three years ("fast start" financing) and US$ 100 billion per year by   2020, from many sources. At Canc&uacute;n, countries create a new fund to channel   these, the Green Climate Fund, whose Transitional Committee worked to put the   rules in place in Durban, although many points are undecided. Figuring out   whether funds are in fact "new and additional" will require quite complicated   calculations (Stadelmann, Roberts, and Michaelowa 2011). Starting with their   October 2010 meeting and repeatedly since, the BASIC Ministers have moved to   ever stronger language insisting that the money must come, showing steadily   more impatience with the North's slowness in acting on its "obligation" to fund   Southern action, especially for adaptation. The Green Climate Board is meeting   for the first time in August 2012. In addition, they have repeatedly stressed   that the reporting mechanisms must be standardized and transparent. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In some ways, the interests of the G-77 have been   strengthened by this support from the economically more powerful BASIC   countries. Especially in contrast to Northern countries, they share similar   ideas about how the funding should take place. After the Canc&uacute;n meeting, the   BASIC countries have also taken care to stress that some sub-categories of the   G-77 &#150; the Small Island Developing States, the LDCs, and Africa &#150; have special   priority for funding assistance for adaptation. The BASIC countries also can   put more pressure on the North by conditioning their own mitigation action on   this financing, a situation that some read as blackmail (Harris 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, the presence of quickly-developing   countries like the BASIC countries in the G-77 may complicate the situation. A   counterview argues that the new economic might of countries like China, India,   and Brazil has actually made their bargaining position more difficult, as the   North now feels threatened (Hurrell and Sengupta 2012, 472&#150;3). Northern   countries fear the BASIC countries, especially China and India, as economic   competitors. In Timmons Roberts' view, the intertwining of the climate issue   with US fears that it is losing its hegemonic status to China will prevent any   easy resolution to questions like a just distribution of carbon space (Roberts   2011).</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Current climate finance </font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever the long-term structural and geopolitical   implications of the rise of the BASIC countries, more prosaic conflicts of   interest are already apparent between the BASIC countries and the rest of the   G-77. The most important source of funding for climate action to this point is   the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), created through the Kyoto Protocol to   allow developed countries to meet some of their climate mitigation targets   through financing mitigation efforts in developing countries (Lecocq and   Ambrosi 2007). Empirically, BASIC absorbed almost all of that source of climate   finance. A full 52% of the CDM projects that have received Issued Certified   Emissions Reductions since the first projects in 2005 have been based in China,   while India hosted another 21.5%, and Brazil nearly 8%. Along with South   Africa's 0.5%, the BASIC countries together hosted more than 81% of all CDM   projects issued.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a></font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Current climate technology transfers </font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A similar situation has emerged with technology and   technology transfer, another key demand of the G-77 in the climate   negotiations. Currently, just ten countries do 80% of the world's research and   development and hold 95% of the patents (Victor 2011, xxxi). In the area of   clean energy technology in particular, Japan, the US, Germany, Korea, the   United Kingdom, and France hold 80% of the patents (UNEP, European Patent   Office, and ICTSD 2010, 4). Extensions of that technology outside of the major   technology powers go disproportionately to the BASIC countries. Despite all the   calls for licensing of such technology to developing countries, there is still   very little of it in the climate area, although it is not rarer than in other industries.   When licensing of clean-energy technology has occurred, China (25%), India   (17%), and Brazil (12%) have been the main recipients. Investors reported that   they made such licensing agreements with countries that had significant   infrastructure and human capital, presented favorable market conditions and   investment climates, and protected intellectual property rights (UNEP, European   Patent Office, and ICTSD 2010, 7). Developing countries are also making inroads   in filing their own patents in a few specific areas, notably India in solar,   and Brazil and Mexico in hydro/marine patenting (UNEP, European Patent Office,   and ICTSD 2010, 4). Thus it is the BASIC countries and some similar ones that   are also the main actors from the developing world in the realm of technology   and patents, while many members of the G-77 fall short.</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BASIC as providers of climate finance?</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The BASIC countries are beginning to play larger roles   as donors to other countries, obviously a new departure for countries that were   and are still recipients of development assistance themselves (Draher and   Nunnenkamp 2011; Kragelund 2011; Woods 2008). While all give increasing amounts   of aid, they vary quite a bit in the details of their assistance &#150; and in   whether they provide assistance related to climate change in particular.

Its usual development   assistance has been oriented to its region, but has been truncated in the wake   of recent weak economic growth instead of expanding to cover climate (Kragelund   2011, 594).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">India is by all measures the poorest of the four, but   Jairam Ramesh, its lead negotiator in Copenhagen and Canc&uacute;n, thought that India   could take on many of the costs of its own action. Speaking to a hostile Indian   parliament, he told parliamentarians why he had not insisted India receive   priority for climate funding: "Green technology is an area where India can be a   world leader &#91;...&#93;. A country like India should be able to stand on its own feet   and say we will do what we have to do on our own" (Dubash 2012, 245). Indian   negotiators at Durban, however, had backed away from such arguments and now   strongly stated that their poor country could not be expected to take on the economic   development costs of solving the climate change problem. Despite these stances,   India does offer development assistance, with a special focus on its neighbors   and technical assistance. Other initiatives, especially in Africa, aim to   promote trade and investment (Kragelund 2011, 596).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of the four, China and Brazil are the most interesting   transitional cases. In climate negotiations, the Chinese are reluctant to   publicly accept a "responsible power" role that they adopt more   enthusiastically in other settings (Scott 2010). The Chinese negotiator in   Canc&uacute;n, for example, spent a good part of his speech to the plenary insisting   on China's ongoing poverty, but eventually promised assistance to developing   states for their climate efforts.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> At minimum, he said, China would not   compete with poorer states for climate assistance from the North (Hallding   et al. 2011, 29). Actual Chinese development assistance is difficult to   sort out, not least because Chinese accounting is quite different from the   OECD's. Funds distributed through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation since   it began in 2000 have mostly fallen into categories that the OECD would not   count as official development aid. The aid has not been analyzed for its   relationship to climate change mitigation or adaptation, but much of it falls   in the category of "infrastructure projects including roads, power plants and telecommunications"   (Kragelund 2011, 598). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of the four BASIC countries, Brazil has made the most   explicit statements promising climate assistance, during the Copenhagen   meetings. Lula came to the high-level segment of the meeting with a Brazilian   pledge to take action to mitigate its climate emissions, and said that Brazil   would not need the world's resources to do so. He went beyond this statement in   an informal plenary the next day (apparently without pre-approval from the   Ministry of External Relations), offering that Brazil would give climate   assistance to others if that offer would help to break the diplomatic logjam.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a> While the offer was never formally tabled, Brazilian development assistance   does address climate issues. As with the other BASIC countries, it is difficult   to put a dollar figure on total Brazilian development assistance, much less   climate assistance. A survey done by researchers for the Brazilian government   showed total spending of US$ 362 million in 2009 and a five-year   total for 2005&#150;2009 of US$ 1.6 billion (IPEA and ABC 2010, 21). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brazilian climate-related assistance is most apparent   in the technical cooperation agreements that form a significant part of this   assistance.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a> In particular, Brazil executed   technical cooperation agreements in the area of bioenergy and biofuels in   Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia, and eight countries   that form the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), while similar   agreements were signed with Argentina, Nicaragua, and Suriname.     A branch of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) in Panama   studies biofuels, and Brazil also has a Memorandum of Understanding with the   United States to disseminate biofuels technology. The climate impact of these   programs is currently heatedly contested &#150; an issue that cannot be settled in   this article. Some scientists and activists have maintained that   sugarcane-based biofuels actually contribute to the stocks of greenhouse gases   once the full life cycle of the fuel and associated land-use change are   considered (Dauvergne and Neville 2009; Fargione, Hill, Tilman, Polasky, and   Hawthorne 2008; Scharlemann and Laurance 2008). The Brazilian government argues   equally strenuously for the positive contribution of its biofuels for the   climate, working with the United States to show the sustainability of its biofuels   model for Africa and Latin America (Hochstetler 2012; Minist&eacute;rio de Minas e   Energia 2010). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beyond their individual efforts, there are even more   incipient collective initiatives from the same countries in their other   formations. India, Brazil, and South Africa as IBSA have created a fund that   uses the United Nations Development Programme to distribute about   US$ 3 million annually, with equal contributions from each member.   These fund small-scale projects in the poorest countries, and have not touched on   climate issues (White 2009). In March 2012, the four BASIC countries and Russia   decided to form a BRICS development bank and are in active negotiations on the   matter. Very basic questions like who will be eligible for loans from this bank   are still under discussion. The member countries have used their own national   development banks quite differently, so it is likely to take some time for the   bank to operate effectively.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup>12</sup></a> None of these are currently sources of   climate finance, but they are additional indicators of a partial change in   orientation towards development assistance by the BASIC members.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The G-77 has been an important negotiating coalition   for developing countries for almost 50 years, and has coordinated their   positions on climate change for 20 years. To what extent is it still an   effective forum for the South and how has it been affected by the emergence of   a new BASIC coalition of some of its largest and most dynamic members? </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most observers have seen a relationship of mutual   benefit or at least mutual dependency between the members of the G-77 and BASIC   (e.g. Hallding et al. 2011; Kasa, Gullberg, and Heggelund 2008; Vihma,   Mulugetta, and Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen 2011). In general, the G-77 is seen to   benefit from the greater visibility and negotiating weight of its larger and   wealthier members, while the BASIC countries avoid isolation and gain   legitimacy for their demands when they are couched within the G-77's agenda.   After the initial Copenhagen conference when the BASIC countries appeared most   distinct as a negotiating coalition, they have taken pains to reinsert   themselves in the G-77. They have taken up the G-77's demands for greater   procedural equality and transparency and brought weight to the G-77's   preference for extensive public climate finance from the North (even if it is   slow to materialize).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, this article has shown that many   members of the G-77 appear to have some concrete disadvantages from asserting   similarity with the BASIC countries. Many G-77 members now argue that their   future development depends on climate action by the BASIC countries, which   Brazil and South Africa are more ready to do than China and India (Hallding   et al. 2011; Hochstetler 2012). The G-77 is less and less recognized as a   leader in climate negotiations, while the BASIC countries and especially China   have gained visibility for themselves. The BASIC countries have taken large   shares of existing climate finance in the Clean Development Mechanism and   acquired much of the clean energy technology that was transferred. Increased   recognition of differentiation might serve as an argument for more development   assistance from the BASIC countries to the G-77, still mostly at the level of   rhetoric. More broadly, some have argued that the emerging power status of   China and the other BASIC countries is a hindrance to negotiating concessions   from the North.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the end, the G-77's perspective is unlikely to   shape the final outcome. The BASIC countries showed themselves to be seriously   divided over climate action at Durban, especially on the question of their own   action. Without agreement on that fundamental question, the BASIC coalition   seems unlikely to continue to play a central role in climate negotiations.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bibliographic references</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alexandroff, Alan S. and   Andrew F.

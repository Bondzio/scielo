Abstract The decolonization of museums, an important idea for some museologists from the 1960's and 1970's who wanted to create an avant-guard museology, relates to a set of concepts that hoped to revolutionize museological practice at the end of the 20th century. The idea of the "ecomuseum" as a prototype for experimental museological practice emerged in the midst of this transformation. Through a historical analysis of the Écomusée du Creusot Montceau-les-Mines, created in the French region of the Bourgogne in 1974, this article investigates changes in the local "axiological grammar" as engendered by museum grammar. It also reflects more widely on the changes in values in international museology effected by the concept of the "ecomuseum" and the new museology movement.

The technology used in organic farming and post-harvest processing is contributing to the development of production standards that are quite different from those of modern agriculture. The desire of consumers to acquire food that does not endanger their health is changing the market; and organic products are coming to be preferred and valued by a growing segment of the population. In not using chemical products, organic farming returns to and renews traditional farming concepts by means of knowledge-intensive technological innovations. The objective of the case study reported here was to investigate innovations in the post-harvest processing of organic produce on a farm in the Central-Western region of Brazil. The innovation process was driven by certification requirements, specifically those dealing with minimal processing and packaging. The article addresses the historic characteristics of innovation in agriculture, the difficulties of investment in technologies in organic farming and the competitiveness of the present market. The study was conducted through a series of interviews. Results demonstrate that the modifications in internal routines and the adoption of technical standards induced by the certification process were responsible for the innovations, permitting the production of high-standard organic produce for the market.

Four different conceptions of scientific research and educational practice are analysed. The first one is called integrated, for both research and practice are considered the same thing. The second says the contrary, emphasising that there exist only a complementary relationship. The third offers a critical view affirming that alienation and mercantile power define both. Finally, the fourth considers that there is a risk wich produced by the increase of reflexivity in society, is causing incontrollable effects on social order. The article takes as example educational data in Brazil from 1990's decade up to now. The author suggests that it is important to rethink the modern educational myth of the scientific understanding which supports educational philosophies as a whole. Based in Giddens and Beck approaches, he argues that scientific education must consider the importance of social effects of epistemological production in the so called high modernity.

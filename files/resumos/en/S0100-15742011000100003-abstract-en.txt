This article presents results from a research on the quality of Early Childhood Education in Brazil that was conducted in a collaborative effort between Fundação Carlos Chagas, the Ministry of Educations and the Inter-American Development Bank. Data were collected in 147 crèches and preschools in six state capitals, during the second semester of 2009. The instruments applied for the observation of classes were the translated versions of the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale Revised Edition and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale Revised Edition. Questionnaires for principals and for teachers of the observed classes were also applied. The main results are: crèches and preschools average scores were in the basic level; the lowest scores received were related to Activities (crèche and preschool), Personal care routines (crèche), and Program structure (preschool); if changes were promoted in some of the institutions characteristics, those scores could be significantly improved

Abstract: The article has as its broader objective to discuss the participation of feminist writers in the national narratives of the first decades of the twentieth century in Brazil and Portugal, making some intersections between them. To this purpose, I have restricted the analysis to the representations of gender and nation built by the Portuguese Ana de Castro Osório and Brazilian Júlia Lopes de Almeida in the epistolary novels Mundo Novo (1930) and O Correio da Roça (1913), respectively. I argument that, unlike the more hegemonic male perspective of representing the nation which tends to establish a model of female domestication and submission, those writers built a representation of nation associating its progress with women&#8217;s emancipation and independence.

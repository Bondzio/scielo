In the 1920s women's civil rights were discussed at different stages of the public sphere in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. Nevertheless, the formula "full civil capacity" was long retarded. In this context, we observe a provocative phenomenon: the lives, works and deaths of three women that transited a common fate. Through the study of this phenomenon we can look at the process of women's civil emancipation from a new perspective. A juridical and comparative interpretation of it helps to underline the limits of a process of emancipation of which these women were undoubtedly part of at least as individuals.

Abstract This article discusses pronouncements about abortion by women parliamentarians in Brazilian Chamber of Deputies between 1991 and 2014. The focus is on women`s positions, especially the ones that were most active in the debate about abortion, their arguments and its relations with religious ties. The analysis is also aware of the context in which that debate took place, assimilating information about disputes and the main actors (feminist movements, religious groups, and the State) and situating their reactions to projects and norms presented.

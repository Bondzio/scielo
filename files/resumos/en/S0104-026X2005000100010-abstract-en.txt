This paper aims to point out the concept of adolescence as plural and permeated by diverse conditionings, all of its possible expressions marked by insertions of social class and gender. Based in data obtained from a research with 205 adolescent of a low income neighbourhood in Natal/RN, and from records of the activities realized with adolescents from ten to fourteen years old living also in the same area, the analysis highlights the marked influence of social sexist experience aggravated by the precarious social economical context in the adolescent socialization process. The finding of this study permits to think about the construction process of adolescent subjectivity from shared experiences in the different social encounters, offering suggestions for improvement interventions in the areas of health and education.

In this article, the author tries to re-construct, through the novels of Theodor Fontane (1819-1899), Alfred D&#246;blin (1878-1957), and Irina Liebmann (1943) the city landscape during three decisive periods of Berlin's history: (I) the years of the "Founders" (Gr&#252;nderjahre), since 1870; (II) the years of the Weimar Republic, between the two World Wars, and, finally, (III) the twenty-eight years of the existence of the Berlin Wall. Cant these literary images of the past help us to forecast the shape of Berlin "after the Fall"?

In this paper I examine a set of personal photographs belonging to a man in 1940. My aim is to demonstrate the ways in which the visual and the photographic device produce gendered subjectivities. I also present some masculine stereotypes from that period and analyze the ways in which they are represented in the photographs of masculine visualities.

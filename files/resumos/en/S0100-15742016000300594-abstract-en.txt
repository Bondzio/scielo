Abstract Lack of discipline, violence and bullying in schools today are significant concerns of society in general and the subject of much attention in the media. This article presents a global systematization of research results, focusing on the exploratory stage of a meta-analysis of doctoral research. This phase considers only dissertations submitted at Portuguese universities that are accessible through the Repositório Científico de Acesso Aberto de Portugal [Open Access Scientific Repository of Portugal] - RCAAP. In addition to the growing social visibility of the lack of discipline, violence and bullying, the difficulties of conceptual delineation and empirical operationalization, as well as methods of intervention in order to prevent and regulate disruptive occurrences in the school environment are related here. The global systematization of research results also enables the identification of possible future lines of research.

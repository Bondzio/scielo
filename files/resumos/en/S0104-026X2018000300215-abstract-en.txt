Abstract: This study aims at understanding the sexual experiences and perceptions of Portuguese women over 65 years of age. Individual semi-structured interviews were made to 13 women (7 married and 6 widows), aged between 66 and 85 years of age, and the data gathered was analyses using thematic analysis. From this analysis 5 themes stood out - Perceptions about gender roles, Sex &#8220;obligation&#8221;, Sexuality and ageing, Fears of marriage and sexuality and Sexual Education. To the participants facing the ageing derived changes, such as the end of a sexual obligation or as an opportunity to readapt sexually, are completely connected with the conjugal relation established and the ideologies that both couple members have.

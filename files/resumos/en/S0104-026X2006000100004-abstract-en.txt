This article is about sexual myths and conducts, aiming to demonstrate the constructed nature of the Brazilian sexuality representation as highly eroticized and malleable. Starting from a constructivist perspective of sexuality, the myth of Brazilian sexual nature is analyzed. There is a widespread idea that Brazilian culture is sexually too open, expansive and warm - which is considered as a positive reference for national identity. Considering historical data and those originated from a survey carried out in three regions of the country with young people of both sexes aged 18 through 24, the article demonstrates that sexual behaviors do not correspond to the socially diffused image of Brazilian sexuality - strongly patterned by gender relations.

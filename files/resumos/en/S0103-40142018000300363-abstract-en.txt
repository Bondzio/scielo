ABSTRACT This paper proposes an approach to Complexity Engineering, that takes into account the complex thinking framework proposed by Edgar Morin. The main foundations of this approach are open systems design, emergence, and the inclusion of GÃ´del&#8217;s randomness and incompleteness, which are contextualized in real-life constructive problems.

The objective of this paper is to study the invasions (occupation) of land properties held by the so called Brazilian social movements. This conflict concerns the disputes between farmers and social movements, in which the landowners questioned the legality of the invasion for agrarian reform and compliance with the immediate mandate of reinstatement of possession when there is invasion of property. On the side of the social movements, land invasions have become the main form of pressure) to speed up expropriation processes and settlements. Having as institutional landmark, the "anti-invasion Law", associated with the report on properties invaded released by the Federation of Agriculture of the State of Parana (Faep in Portuguese), it was developed an empirical model applied to land owners in conflict areas encompassing invasions occurred over 2000 and 2006. Based on the premises of the New Institutional Economics and on the analysis of land property rights and private investments, this study examined the relation between the variable "invasion period" (proxy for the property right insecurity) and "land productivity level" (proxy for investment), by comparing farmers productivity before and after the invasion. The descriptive results showed important effects on investment decisions of producers and a greater complexity of the relationship between variables.

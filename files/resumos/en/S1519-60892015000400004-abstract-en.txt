Abstract: In this paper, the author considers the critique that Axel Honneth has formulated against the distributive model of justice for which Rawls is one of the most important theoretical representatives today. After having outlined the three main limits of the &#8220;distributive paradigm&#8221; (in terms of proceduralism, atomism, and state-centrism), he then discusses Honneth&#8217;s counter-model of justice. Honneth&#8217;s &#8220;ethical&#8221; theory of justice consists in a &#8220;normative recognition&#8221; of the &#8220;institutions of recognition&#8221; that allows individuals to experience certain forms of &#8220;social freedom&#8221; based on mutual recognition. As a conclusion, the author deals with some of the difficulties associated with Honneth&#8217;s &#8220;ethical&#8221; theory of justice.

The present paper aims at defining the brazilian concept of especially protected areas and at differentiating this concept from other ones that dominate in the environmental area, such as protected areas and the brazilian conservation units. In this context it uses legal terminology to discuss the effectiveness of the constitutional norm for especially protected areas based on environmental concepts. We conclude our work by identifying some incompatibilities between theory and practice in the management of especially protected areas and indicating some solutions.

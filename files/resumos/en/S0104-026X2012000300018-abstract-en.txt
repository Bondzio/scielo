The review of the legacy of Simone de Beauvoir in recent decades has centered in various approaches, with its analysis requiring the use of a methodology that highlights the subtleties of her writings. This article will focus on a triadic concept in her autobiographical oeuvre and on the effects her texts have on cultural interpolation. Deeply critical of the discursive parameters of tradition, which are devoted to logical and ontological principles, Beauvoir proposes new ways of thinking. From a methodological perspective, this article will address this theme in various levels of reading, namely: the conceptual, historical and hermeneutical. It will focus on the feminine as the principal character in its philosophical-literary texts, in terms of its subjectivity and alterity, while being a provocative fact in the search of a redefinition for the meaning of aesthetic symmetry.

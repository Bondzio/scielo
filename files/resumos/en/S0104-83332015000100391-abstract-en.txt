"Polyamory" is a native name given to the possibility of establishing more than one loving relationship at the same time with the agreement of everyone involved. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the articulation between the ideals of freedom and equality in the discourses of Brazilian "polyamorists" about love and sexuality. The research was conducted through the analysis of four "polyamorous" virtual networks, five interviews with supporters and participant observation in "polymeetings".

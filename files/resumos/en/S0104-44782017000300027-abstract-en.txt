Abstract We investigate the relationship between corruption and political participation in Latin America. We selected three blocks of countries that are situated in low, intermediary and high position in Experience of Corruption Ranking: Chile and Uruguay, Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Mexico and Peru, respectively. Our analysis occurs in individual level and we use as data source the Americas Barometer (2006) (2008) and 2010 rounds. We point as principal results: (1) the identification of four types of political participation; (2) a positive association between corruption and political participation, considering all rounds and all blocks of countries; and (3) the greater tolerance of corruption among individuals that have experienced corruption, regardless of this feature being followed by political activism.

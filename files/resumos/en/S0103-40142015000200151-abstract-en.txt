The relationship between forest cover and water supply has been studied for decades, especially in regard to the ecohydrological functions provided by native vegetation. In this study, we present a literature synthesis of the different ecohydrological functions provided by the forests and how the provision of these functions may be affected by recent changes in the Brazilian Forest Code. Depending on the location in the watershed, the functions provided by the forests can be more associated to aquifer recharge, to the reduction of runoff and erosion, to the protection of water bodies, or complementing all these functions. Thus, forest cover is needed in different regions of the watersheds to ensure the provision of all ecohydrological functions. The new Brazilian Forest Code reduced the legal protection of vegetation in all the different regions of the watersheds, and may reduce provision of water resources in adequate quality and regularity needed to supply future demands. To mitigate this situation, it is necessary to establish new public policies to maintain or restore native vegetation in different regions of the watersheds.

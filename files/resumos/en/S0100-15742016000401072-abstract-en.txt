Abstract In this paper, we seek to understand the needs and dilemmas encountered during the implementation of the "Escola Plural" [Plural School] Proposal, since 1995, in the city of Belo Horizonte. How did the teachers receive the new guidelines? How did the public text change with the opposition found? To answer these questions, we interviewed twenty managers from the Municipal Department of Education, who were present when the Proposal was made. To this end, we use concepts based on the psychoanalytical framework of the Frenchman René Kaës. We hope, with this study, to contribute to better understand the conditions under which changes in educational policies occur.

Abstract: Based on an analysis about the preferences of the Uruguayan legislators, this work analyzes the Brazilian influence on the countries of the region and the leadership that it projects. The information and database for this analysis comes from a survey of 96% of the Uruguayan parliament, the analysis of the parliamentary debate in the period (2010-2015) and the press, and interviews of qualified informants and key actors. From the information gathered and based on the analysis of the Uruguayan case, this study proposes an exercise of formulating questions and hypotheses about the impact that the Brazilian's current internal crisis and the reconfiguration of the international system may have had on both on its international action and in the Southamerican countries&#8217; foreign policies.

Abstract: This paper aims to analyze the contribution of the approach of the socioanthropology of development to the investigation of development situations, such as programs, projects, and actions. It combines two levels of consideration. The first level emphasizes the recent path of studies on developmental processes, from which new approaches emerge. The second level considers the discussion of the socioanthropology of development, highlighting its methodology and taking stock of its strong and weak points. Despite some fragilities, the approach of the socioanthropology of development is seen as broadly favourable, mainly concerning its goal of providing a solid basis for the studies on the developmental processes, which can bestow on this research field a respectable theoretical status.

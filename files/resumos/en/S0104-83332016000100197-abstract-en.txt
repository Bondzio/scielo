Abstract This study aimed to delineate women&#8217;s participation in recent research conducted by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fundação Oswaldo Cruz - Fiocruz). The initial data source was the Human Resources Directory (Diretoria de Recursos Humanos - Direh) at Fiocruz, which was used to identify the number of employees with doctorates. The ScriptLattes tool was then used to search for curriculum vitae (CV) that were registered in the Lattes Platform for the period from 1996 to 2013. The results indicate that although women&#8217;s bibliographic production in absolute numbers is greater than men's, they have an average production performance higher than women&#8217;s. A second document analysis was performed to map women's participation in decision-making positions at Fiocruz. In general, the data suggest hierarchical (or vertical) segregation, a phenomenon known in the literature as the &#8220;glass ceiling&#8221;, which is characterized by a slower rise in career for women compared to men. This disadvantage results in the underrepresentation of women in positions of decision-making, and women are limited from reaching the most prestigious positions in the institution.

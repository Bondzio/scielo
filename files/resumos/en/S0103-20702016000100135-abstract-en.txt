ABSTRACT In this paper we analyze a number of problematic situations in the working spaces of young people from popular classes in the city of CÃ³rdoba (Argentina), and we show many interpenetrations among the different spheres of everyday life and work spaces specifically. Returning to the notions of "value spheres" and "social scenes", we propose an interpretation of movement of logics of action and value criteria as resource management strategies in the workplace, enabled by structural homologies between different social scenes (work, family, school, street, politics) and anchored in the structure of class relations.

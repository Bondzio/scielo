Abstract The essay seeks to elucidate a possible literary design having common people&#8217;s lives and values as theme and aesthetic, reviewing the transatlantic processes of culture circulation, in a sociological-procedural perspective. To this end, it locates the description and interpretation of the fable of Topaze in the nineteenth century&#8217;s social figurations and cenarios of civilizatory interpenetration between France and Brazil, which made possible the publication and readings of Scènes de la vie privées et publique des animaux. Amidist an atmosphere of astonishment before the technological innovations, the structural pair animality-humanity synthesizes the modern world self-regulatory and emotional control standards in the context of unstable civilizatory exchanges.

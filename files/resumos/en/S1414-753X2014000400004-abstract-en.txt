This paper aims at analyzing the discourse from the press in Sergipe concerning possible socio-environmental risks caused by the transposition the waters of the River SÃ£o Francisco/Brazil. To ensure the initial scope, the theoretical argumentation will be structured in three distinct moments: the first one introduces a concept of risk and its socio-environmental dimensions, the second presents risk communication as a fundamental step in the management of socio-environmental risks, according to ISO 31000:2009; the third concerns the results obtained from discourses in the press in Sergipe that deal with the transposition. This work employs discourse analysis in a documental research of the papers Correio de Sergipe, Jornal da Cidade and Cinform, in the period 2004-2007. The journalistic discourses were selected by means of their headlines, in an attempt to effect a "study of meanings" and a "mapping of voices". Afterwards, we identified"discoursive formations" related to socio-environmental risks of the transposition, thereby confirming the idea of a non-neutrality of discourse.

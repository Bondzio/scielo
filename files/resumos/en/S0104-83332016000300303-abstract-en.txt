Abstract This study investigates the Brazilian international mobility &#8216;Science without Borders&#8217; (SwB) Programme, in particular the case of Unicamp (Brazil). The article addresses how women are performing in the SwB Programme when compared to men, and which factors may explain such performance. The results show that Unicamp female students have higher participation than male students in the SwB compared to their paticipation at Unicamp courses, and suggest that cultural capital might be an explaining factor for women supersede barriers to participate in international mobility programmes.

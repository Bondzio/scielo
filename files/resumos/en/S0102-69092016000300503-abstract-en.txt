One of the most important features of Max Weber&#8217;s analyzes about inequality is the known distinction between economic class and social status as two separate dimensions of stratification. The present paper, then, aims to verify if in contemporary Brazil we could identify a well-defined status hierarchy. Data from the National Household Survey (2013) will be used, through which &#8211; applying the multidimensional scaling technique &#8211;, we will work cross information concerning occupational categories of heads of households and their partners. As a result, we will have a range of social proximities and distances, to be presented, analyzed and also discuss the validity of its interpretation as a status indicator.

Abstract This article looks for the analysis of the symbolic value of an urban area during a period of economic changes in Pereira, Colombia. It studies the transition between a time when the marketplace synthesized favorable feelings and meanings thanks to the coffee economy, and other in which this economic activity became insignificant and the symbolic value of this space &#8220;obsolete&#8221; became negative and that justified their demolition and the construction of a &#8220;modern&#8221; commercial urban complex. This study involved the observation of this space for different periods, as well as conducting interviews with the politicians and the experts in the local urban planning and reviewing secondary sources.

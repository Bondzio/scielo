This article presents the results of a research realized with Art teachers who works with basic education in the city of Feira de Santana (BA). The research collected data about the initial and permanent formation of the Bahia's teachers, work conditions and Art's conceptions with a set of questions requiring specific answers and open-ended as well, during the period between March and December of 1998. They evidenced those teachers' not specific formation, the faulty aspects of the initial formation, the precarious career conditions and work, besides ambiguous conceptions on the Art teaching. The researches discussed the permanent formation of those teachers, as cultural action, so that is possible the development of a work that democratizes the access to the Art without restriction to any space or private human group.

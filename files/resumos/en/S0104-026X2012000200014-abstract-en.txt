By not relying on a single sexual and gender model of reference to be effective, we aim at problematizing the transvestite expression. Such specificity would allow us to talk about 'transvestilization' processes. These processes are constituted through devices in which tough, flexible and leak lines participate in the creation of their bodies, desires and pleasures. This creation transits among normative and singularized discourses effects/consequences. The transvestites transit in the world, challenging the binary heteronormative matrices of the sex/gender/desire system. Such system fails in relation to modes of subjectivity oriented by subversive power, which create new possible territories of existence. In this perspective, our goal is to demonstrate that transvestites' sexual and gender expression generate new questions about the current identity models. This questioning demonstrates that the coherence and the intelligibility imposed by heteronormative codes need to be urgently reviewed in order to question the sociall order presented by the splitting gender in reproductive sex. It also seems to be important to reframe the generic and subjective sexual expressions in its historical processuality, which explode the binaries, despise the universal and liquefy the absolutism of the idea of truth; an idea rooted in binary systems of settled, closed and universal ahistorical thoughts.

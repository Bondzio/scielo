This article examines how public policies for health and social care in Brazil are consolidated with the actions of poor women. Through a qualitative research and analysis of the trajectories of these users and top agents of the so called "new" Brazilian social programs, I intend to show that the success such programs have achieved is largely due to the work of these women, who are mediators within the conservative logic of a gender bias division of labor and denomination of women as caregivers. In particular, the agents, as opposed to the users, have access to social mobility that frees them from the confinement of their private sphere by being present in the labor market. However, this female mobilization, with low costs and high productivity, benefits mainly the institutions of the "new" social programs in question, from philanthropic organizations to governmental ones.

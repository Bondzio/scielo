Abstract This work seeks to evaluate the presence of an inertial democracy in Brazil, where asymmetries between economics and politics create a passive and anomic political culture. Such a situation allows for social and economic policies to follow a pattern that faces limited change. If, in a context of changes, things need to change in order to remain the same, then in a scenario of inertial (re-) democratization, institutions can be expected to change without, however, altering, in a positive direction, the population&#8217;s norms, values, and normative beliefs about democracy. In order to assess this proposition, demographic and socio-economic data will be analyzed along with the evolution of trust in institutions, politicians, and democracy for the period of 2002&#8211;2014 using data from the Brazilian Electoral Survey (Eseb). The conclusion is that the period of favorable economic performance did not allow for the consolidation of a democratic political culture, with a rapid deterioration of support for institutions and leaders following the economic crisis.

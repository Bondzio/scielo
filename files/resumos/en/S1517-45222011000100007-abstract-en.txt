Four concepts are presented herein, deemed keys to reformulating technological education, with the purpose of guiding the collective construction of more equitable and participative relationships between technological innovation and social goals. These concepts are: "technical code" (A. Feenberg), "civic epistemology" (J. Jasanoff), "socio-technical citizenship" (H. Thomas) and "implication context" (F. Tula Molina). We propose a synergistic relationship between these concepts, through a broad perspective that regards the students primarily in their citizenship dimension, deeming them as future judges, lawyers, economists, engineers, educators and so on. In doing so, we aim to provide them with a critical and informed opinion on the technological policies that will affect both their human and social dimensions. One can reasonably expect that the acquired education will allow the student to develop attitudes of personal responsibility towards the natural environment and the quality of life. With such curricular design students may acquire critical capabilities for participating in the institutions where technological innovations and their related practices are elaborated, designed and regulated. I consider that such approach allows the educational system to strengthen technological literacy processes, by means of an active stance towards participation and responsible citizenship.

The main goal of this paper is to produce a critical analysis regarding the conception of multiple activities in the Portuguese rural society. This work questions the classic vision of the country that delineates a rigid territorial and sociological divisions (for instance, the distinction between Northern and the Southern region) from which it tends to characterize different types of agriculture. Considering this conception, the paper proposes a different perspective that is capable to integrate differences and resemblances, between some of the social and the economic aspects that have redefined the family organization and their work activities.

Abstract The public performance of the singer Daniela Mercury to assume (in 2013) a marital relationship with another woman is taken as a starting point for discussion on equal civil marriage in contemporary Brazil. It is intended to discuss the inclusion of conflicting religious morals in some public debates on rights, emphasizing the notion of &#8220;subjectivism&#8221; as a structuring value of modernity in the production of autonomous subjects in the face of various religious backgrounds. The discussion herein also aims to highlight tensions between the Catholic formation of Daniela Mercury and her current belonging to Candombl√©, questioning points about homoparenthood through of religious values professed by the singer.

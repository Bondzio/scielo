This article aims to investigate how the Nonaka and Takeuchi's five stages of knowledge creation model can contribute for the rural properties' management. This study analyzes case studies of farmers in Brazil and Australia using various data types, including document related to farm producers, on-site observation, questionnaire, semistructured interview and focus groups. It was found that, in a property where people sought to socialize, question, and innovate constantly, there was more space to create tacit knowledge and transform it to explicit. Farmers who were innovated and more critical about their practices have shown a greater chance in order to create a field of knowledge interaction. In the context of rural farmers, knowledge, experiences and information could be found and shared among them. However, it is more important that they use the information practically in order to produce an effective outcome.

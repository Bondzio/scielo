The first and second levels of education in Brazil (8+3 years) have shared buildings, equipment and even faculty for a long time. The fast enrolment increase of the second level arises important questions on the actual needs of school construction, as well as on enrolment decentralization and schools pedagogical identity. Census data reveal that it will be necessary to build numerous schools, however, there is still significant underutilization of space and time. Therefore, state and municipal governments will need to co-operate, keeping to share personnel and material resources. For better results it is necessary to operationalize the intergovernmental collaboration system, prescribed by Constitution. Clearer and steadier rules are to be negotiated, avoiding casuistical or arbitrary solutions.

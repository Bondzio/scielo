The paper aims at high lighting a set of institutional changes undergone by contemporary cultural policies in Brazil, on a national scale, and understand how these settings produced new forms of cultural agency and political action, at local scales. For this purpose, initially, there was a review at Brazilian cultural policies, as literature. Then, through systematic monitoring of cultural policies in two Brazilian cities - Gramado (RS) and SÃ£o Luiz do Paraitinga (SP) - analyzed its implementation and the modes of action of the actors in these processes, considering its tensions, disputes and interests at stake.

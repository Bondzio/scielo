ABSTRACT As theories of society the theory of Marx is evolutionary theory. Marx distinguishes the historical evolution of class-struggles from the evolutionary logic of the capitalist system. However, he does not draw a clear distinction between work and interaction. Therefore, he tends to subsume class-struggle under the logic of capital. Although Marx explains all great revolutions as legal revolutions, the priority of the economy prevents him to understand the fundamental role of law for the evolution of modern society. Although Marx has seen rightly the internal relation of functional differentiation and class-formation, he tends to reduce functional differentiation to the economy. Although Marx describes modern society as a society of world markets, world literature, and world revolutions, he lacks a concept of world society, and he still maintains a Eurocentric perspective on the world. If we correct these faults, Marxism still is the best theory to explain the social evolution in the light of practical change.

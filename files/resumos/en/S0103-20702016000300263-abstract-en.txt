Abstract The recent pluralization of perspectives in sociology of literature has led to a more nuanced comprehension of literature in relation to the idea of reflection that has marked its research tradition, as indicated by the bibliographical accounts published in English in the last three decades which are analyzed here. However, literature and society are in general still conceived as external to each other, and not as forming a reflexive relationship. Drawing on the theories of Anthony Giddens and Niklas Luhmann in order to qualify the idea of reflexivity, the paper argues that they are different but equally consistent points of departure for a renewed agenda for sociology of literature.

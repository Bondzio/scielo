abstract This article aims to analyze and compare aspects of the gender-based division of labor between the regions of Brazil. To this end, we performed descriptive statistical analyses of participation in the labor market, participation in domestic activities, hours of housework and total hours worked. The results reveal that the gender-based division of labor is unequal and unfavorable to Brazilian women and that there is not great heterogeneity between regions.

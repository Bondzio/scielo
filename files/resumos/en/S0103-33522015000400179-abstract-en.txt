Abstract The article presents some data from a study carried out in the state of Rio de Janeiro in 2014, on reconciliation between paid work and family life and gender mediations in that balance. By selecting part of the data, the article suggests that in addition to impacts in public spheres on the opportunities and careers in the labor market and/or on the presence in political spaces often discussed in recent decades, unequal distribution of domestic work has effects on individuals' feelings of wellbeing, considered in subjective rather than material terms. However, that does not occur in an undifferentiated way when it comes to gender relations. Men and women have different responses to sociability activities and practices as well as levels of "satisfaction", showing once again that unequal standards of responsibility and domestic and family involvement are social problems rather than matters of individual choice.

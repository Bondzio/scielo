This article interrogates the theoretical frameworks, methods and instruments of analyses employed in the study of men and masculinity. In doing so, it questions essentialist definitions of men while examining the schemes, the habitus, and the homophobic, heterosexual and virile model that construct and strengthen masculine identity and domination. To accomplish the above, the author addresses a vast array of contemporary French feminist debates.

Reality shows have gained extraordinary prominence on television, providing an                instance of Baudrillard's concept of the hyperreal and standing at                the basis of the plot of Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games. A                product targeted at the youth, it is nevertheless very different from most of the                texts addressed to this type of audience. The story describes an extreme reality show                in which teenagers of both sexes must compete against one another to the point of                death while the population watches and the political and media powers control them.                The great success of the novels and their film adaptations, as well as the                originality of a proposal with strong political connotations, explain the relevance                and the sociological interest of this paper. With a theoretical-deductive approach,                this text develops a critical reading of a product that is at the same time                mainstream and unusual, establishing points of contact between the hyperreal and                today's society. Thus, it can be affirmed that the simulacrum of dystopia/futuristic                world in which the plot unravels constitutes a critique of the social, economic, and                technological inequality that already exists in our world, and is offered to the                audience as an element of critical reflection.

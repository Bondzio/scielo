Abstract: This paper analyzes the articulations among neoliberal governmentality, biopolitics and the notions of sex, gender and sexuality. Furthermore, it aims at demonstrating how the destabilization of the binary gender identity logic threatens certain forms of governing and, also, how the norm can be rearranged producing strategies to embody bodies produced in the contrary of the cissexist pattern. In order to achieve that, the &#8220;gender trouble&#8221; caused by Indianara, who identifies as a trans person and who was arrested during a Slut Walk while walking bare breast, served as an analyzer of such articulations, through the chosen conceptual composition.

Abstract This article defends, firstly, that every political theory is intrinsically and unavoidably normative, even when it claims to be merely descriptive and empirical. In doing so, the article establishes a central difference between &#8220;externalist&#8221; normative theories and normative theories that choose a position of immanent critique. Secondly, it takes a position that is close to the one defended by Horkheimer in 1937 and Adorno in 1961, that of the necessity of developing a critical theory of society that refuses positivism and scientism and acknowledges the contradictions inherent to its own subject. To this end, it shall offer some remarks about possible paths for a Critical Theory capable of understanding and criticizing contemporary society.

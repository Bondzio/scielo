Abstract:In this paper I attempt to discuss the continued production/regulation of the woman, her body and the gender and kinship relations in the context of post-colonial transition in Mozambique, I do it from: 1) the documentation found in the Fund "Indigenous Affairs Directory", at the Historical Archives of Mozambique (AHM) and referred to the troubled process of drafting the Criminal and Civil Codes for the Indigenous of Mozambique, held between 1941 and 1946; and 2) official documents of the FRELIMO (Mozambique Liberation Front) and articles published in the journal "Justica Popular - Bulletin of the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of Mozambique" between 1980 and 1987.

This article presents the results of a study whose objective was to analyze the processes related to the implementation of an educational innovation supported by the Ley Orgánica de Educación in Spain: the incorporation of basic skills into the educational practices of the centers. The role of educational inspection in such a process is highlighted. The research was conducted using qualitative methodology, through a study of multiple cases in six schools of three different autonomous communities. In those cases, the results show that the role played by education inspectors too often undermines innovation proposals, mainly on the basis of excessive surveillance of documents of the educational centers. The findings lead to a careful reflection on the role that these actors must play in education in the development of public policies, and on the need they adopt a role more focused on counseling.

Indicators are useful instruments in the scope of public management, given its ability to measure the effectiveness of government actions. This study aimed to develop an indicator to measure the level of implementation propensity of the Food Acquisition Program (FPA) in some municipalities of Minas Gerais State in 2011, which involves the propensity of food insecurity in the local population and the need to access the market by the local family farming. The indicator was called Propensity Index to Execution of FPA (PIE-FPA), and was produced using two proxies composed by five variables. It was found that the most resources were transferred to farmers located in the municipalities of higher demand of program activities, and that the level of coverage of the program is still incipient in face of the needs of demanding regions. There is also unequal mesorregional coverage of the program, indicating that some regions have been disregarded, especially Zona da Mata Mineira. The PIE-FPA was useful in pointing an innovative public policy in the context of how Brazilian public management has been developed and implemented.

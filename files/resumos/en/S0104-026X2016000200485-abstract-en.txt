Abstract: Based on various studies on motherhood, family evolution, and reproductive strategies in the Basque country, this paper examines how Basque women decide to become mothers, as well as how they develop and exercise their maternal role in the current context. It also looks at the ways their choices and practices are possibly influenced by the emergence of new forms of motherhood and fatherhood. It shows that, despite the dominant model of motherhood, these new forms of parenthood, which are increasingly more visible, accepted and acknowledged, have the capacity to become new examples for women who have to define their own motherhood.

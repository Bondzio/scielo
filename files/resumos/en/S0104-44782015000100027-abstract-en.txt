After the September 11 attacks, private agencies contracts with the CIA and its anti-terrorism activities were a major contributor to the expansion of the private security market in Iraq. This paper aims on relating the growing role of private actors in the counterterrorism strategy of the coalition led by the US in the context of the Iraq occupation. We understand that the lack of control on private security companies&#8217; activities became functional for the liberal democracies engaged in this kind of armed action. In other words, the response to a transforming operational environment where the &#8220;new wars&#8221; happen is one of the factors leading to the rise of the PMSCs. The fact that the weakest enemy can impact the national cohesion of the great powers, imposing significant political and economic costs on their opponents, demands waging war beyond the military operations on the battlefield. Our hypothesis is that the US, and the military coalition that led the Iraq invasion sought to manage political risks (legitimacy) and the risk of life (for combatants and civilians), considered beyond what the public opinion is willing to accept. The strategy is to transfer risks to new civil contractor organizations, less visible, so as to make it extremely hard to determine liability.

This article analyzes the interactions between social movements and juridical institutions in order to observe effects generated by the use of litigation as a strategy for collective action in environmental conflicts. From empirical data and in view of the theoretical debate on Legal Mobilization Theory, we present a characterization of some types of effects: effects that alter or increase the processes of social mobilization itself and effects on the institutions. We argue that the adoption of juridical and judicial strategies produces important implications on processes of social mobilization and institutional change. The analysis was based on the findings of two researches that had investigated the use of public civil action in environmental conflicts. One study collected data from environmental conflicts in general in the state of Esp√≠rito Santo and in the city of Rio de Janeiro, and the other from the Campaign for a Transgenic-free Brazil.

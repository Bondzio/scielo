This report led directly    to the term 'sustainable development' passing into policy discourse, if not    into everyday language. It was also the first overview of the globe, which considered    the environmental aspects of development from an economic, social and political    perspective, a marked advance on the scientific work of Unesco's Man and the    Biosphere Program (MAB) almost a decade earlier. Herman Daly famously commented    that sustainable development was an 'oxymoron'. Now, eighteen years after it    was first introduced, the oxymoron has come of age. This paper considers whether,    having achieved its majority, 'sustainable development' has a future. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Among the principal omissions from the Brundtland    report was detailed consideration of non-human species, and their 'rights',    an area which had received considerable attention during the last ten years    or so. The 'Brundtland Report' (after its Chairperson, the Norwegian Prime Minister    at the time) also opened the way for Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to    be considered a serious element in environment and development issues, a process    that culminated, as we shall see, with the first Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro    in 1992. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since the path-breaking deliberations of the    Brundtland Commission, the expression 'sustainable development' has been used    in a variety of ways, depending on whether it is employed in an academic context,    or that of planning, business or environmental policy. As a result, during the    last eighteen years we have been confronted with several different discourses    of 'sustainable development', some of which are mutually exclusive. For example,    campaigners for greater global equality between nations, huge international    corporations, and local housing associations, have all had recourse to the term    'sustainable development' to justify, or embellish, their actions. It is often    unclear whether these different perspectives are complementary or mutually exclusive.    Exasperation with the limitations of much of the discussion has not been confined    to the political. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can begin our analysis of these different    discourses by returning to essentials. With hindsight we can see that each scientific    problem resolved by human intervention using fossil fuels and manufactured materials,    is conventionally viewed as a triumph of management, and a contribution to economic    good, when it might also be seen as a future threat to sustainability. In the    1970s there was a fear that our major environmental problems would be associated    with resource scarcities (Meadows et al., 1972). At the beginning of the twenty-first    century we are faced by another challenge: that the means we have used to overcome    resource scarcity, including substitution of some natural resources, and 'cleaner'    environmental products and services, may have contributed to the next generation    of environmental problems. This realisation provides an enormous challenge to    social scientists and others who value critical thinking, and who acknowledge    the centrality of the environment and sustainability in a radical programme    for bringing about substantial changes in late capitalism. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Brundtland Commission defined sustainable    development in the following way: </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#91;...&#93; development that meets the needs of      the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet      their own needs. (Brundtland Commission, 1987). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This definition has been brought into service    in the absence of agreement about a process which almost everybody thinks is    desirable. However, the simplicity of this approach is deceptive, and obscures    underlying complexities and contradictions. It is worth pausing to examine the    confusions that still characterise the discussion of sustainable development.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, following the Brundtland definition, it    is clear that "needs" themselves change, so it is unlikely (as the    definition implies) that those of future generations will be the same as those    of the present generation. Obviously development itself contributes to the characterisation    of "needs", by helping to define them differently for each generation,    and for different cultures. Is development, or economic growth the primary determinant    of changing needs, and to what extent does our consciousness of changes in our    needs or 'wants' influence how they are met? These are questions that are rarely    asked outside radical Green circles, but carry implications for all of us. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This raises the second question, not covered    by the definition, of how needs are defined in different cultures. Most of the    "consensus" surrounding sustainable development has involved a syllogism:    sustainable development is necessary for all of us, but it may be defined differently    in terms of each and every culture. This is superficially convenient, until    we begin to ask how these different definitions match up. If in one society    it is agreed that fresh air and open spaces are necessary before development    can be sustainable, it will be increasingly difficult to marry this definition    of "needs" with those of other societies seeking more material wealth,    even at the cost of increased pollution. It is precisely this kind of trade-off    which is apparent in developing countries today, when the gains from accelerated    economic growth promise immediate rewards, and environmental mitigation appears    largely to benefit the rich world. Furthermore, how do we establish which course    of action is <I>more</I> sustainable? Recourse to the view that societies must    decide for themselves is not very helpful. (Who decides? On what basis are the    decisions made?). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are also problems that strike at distinctive    ontological positions. Much of the mainstream debate about sustainable development    has ignored culturally specific definitions of what is sustainable, in favour    of the rather exclusive system of knowledge favoured by the dominant science    paradigm (Norgaard, 1988). It is a paradox of our age that as more people in    the developed world seek solutions to problems outside the conventional 'loop',    in complementary medicine, lifestyle 'downsizing', and supporting alternative    food networks and 'farmers markets', it is still routinely assumed that civil    societies are pursuing the same social and cultural goals. Social fragmentation    and disaffection from 'modernity' have been pronounced since 1987, most notably    in the responses to September 11<SUP>th</SUP> and the challenge posed by fundamentalist    religions (in both the West and the East). Curiously, these profound political    and cultural changes have had only a marginal effect on the way in which 'sustainable    development' is discussed. There is still considerable confusion surrounding    <I>what</I> is to be sustained, that different discourses of sustainable development    sometimes fail to address. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>What is to be sustained? </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some environmental economists argue that the    natural stock of resources, or 'critical natural capital', needs to be given    priority over the flows of income which depend upon it (Pearce, 1991). They    make the point that human-made capital cannot be an effective substitute for    all natural capital. Sustainable development is described as 'strong', rather    than 'weak', when it is most difficult to substitute human-made capital for    nature. If our objective is the sustainable yield of renewable resources, then    sustainable development implies the management of these resources in the interest    of the natural capital stock. If we can measure 'critical natural capital' we    are better placed to make choices about the level of substitution of human-made    for natural capital (Ekins, 1992). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This raises a number of issues, which are both    political and distributive. First, we should not lose sight of the fact that    natural capital, 'critical' or not, is usually owned by individuals, groups    or corporate interests. The defence of common property resources in the face    of relentless market pressures has been the source of considerable political    struggle, much of it intensified since the late 1980s, and the triumph of the    neoliberal agenda in international policy circles. The character of this social    resistance has been recognised with the epithet 'social capital', a term which    frequently underplays political struggles and has the imprimatur of the World    Bank. The conservation of natural capital cannot be separated from some key    distributional questions. Who owns and controls genetic materials, and manages    the environment? What is the relationship between the 'environmental services'    performed by low-income populations, and their future stake in the conservation    of resource systems? Far from taking us away from issues of distributive politics,    and political economy, a concern with sustainable development inevitably raises    such issues more forcefully than ever (Redclift, 1987). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The question 'what is to be sustained?' can also    be answered in another way. Some writers argue that it is present (or future)    levels of production (or consumption) that need to be sustained. The argument    is that the growth of global population will lead to increased demands on the    environment, and our definition of sustainable development should incorporate    this fact. At the same time, the consumption practices of individuals will change    too with rising incomes, especially from a very low base. Given the choice,    most people in India, China or Brazil might want a television or an automobile    of their own, like households in the industrialised North. What prevents them    from acquiring one is their low incomes, their inability to be effective consumers,    and the relatively "undeveloped" infrastructure of poor countries.    If countries like China and India continue to exhibit high long-term rates of    economic growth, as they have during most of the last decade, then their populations'    expectations of their needs will change radically. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is nothing inherently unsustainable in    broadening the market for TV sets or cars, so how would we begin to assess the    implications of these massive consumer trends for 'sustainable development'?    The different discourses of 'sustainable development' have different answers    to this question. Many of those who favour the sustainable development of goods    and service that we receive through the market, and through business activity,    would argue that we should broaden the basis of consumption. Others would argue    that the production of most of these goods and services today is inherently    unsustainable - that we need to 'down-size', or shift our patterns of consumption.    In both developed and, increasingly, developing countries, it is frequently    suggested that it is impossible to function effectively without computerised    information or access to private transport. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The different ways in which 'sustainability'    is approached, then, reflects quite different underlying patterns of everyday    behaviour (or <I>underlying commitments</I>), commitments that are seldom questioned.    People define their 'needs' in ways, which effectively exclude others from meeting    theirs, and in the process can increase the long-term risks for the sustainability    of other peoples' livelihoods. Most important, however, the process through    which we enlarge our choices, and reduce those of others, is largely invisible    to people in their daily lives, although understanding this process is central    to our ability to behave more 'sustainably'. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unless these processes are made more visible    'sustainable development' discourses beg the question of whether, or how, environmental    costs are passed on from one group of people to another, both within societies    and between them. The North dumps much of its toxic wastes, and dirty technology,    on poorer countries, and sources many of its 'needs', for energy, food and minerals,    from the South. At the same time the elevated lifestyles of many rich, and middle    class people in developing countries is dependent on the way in which natural    resources are dedicated to meeting their needs (Martinez-Alier, 1995). Finally,    of course, social inequalities are also intergenerational, as well as intra-generational:    we despoil the present at great cost to the future. Discounting the future,    valuing the present above the future, is much easier to do in materially poor    societies where survival itself may be at stake for many people. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are other forms of inheritance from the    past. Economics developed, historically, around the idea of scarcity, and the    role of technology was principally that of raising output from scarce resources.    Among other benefits of economic growth was the political legitimacy it conferred    within a dynamic capitalist economy, on those who could successfully overcome    the obstacles to more spending, and 'create' more 'wealth'. This assumption    of scarce resources and technological benefits sits uneasily with sustainability    in the industrial North today, and underlines the difficulty in reconciling    "development" with "sustainability". It strikes at the legitimisation    of only one form of "value", albeit the principal one, within capitalist,    industrial societies. It also leaves undisturbed the meaning we attach to 'wealth',    while it is clear that much wealth is created in ways that undermine sustainability.    The German sociologist Habermas expressed this view forcefully, in asking:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &#91;...&#93; Can civilisation afford to surrender      itself entirely to the &#91;...&#93; driving force of just one of its subsystems      - namely, the pull of a dynamic &#91;...&#93; recursively closed, economic system      which can only function and remain stable by taking all relevant information,      translating it into, and processing it in, the language of economic value      &#91;...&#93;. (Habermas, 1991). </font></p> </blockquote>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Sustainability since Rio </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After the 'Earth Summit' in Rio de Janeiro in    1992, the concept of 'sustainability' seemed to exist mainly within quotation    marks. It has already been suggested that the power of the concept of sustainability    lies in the <I>discourses </I>surrounding it, rather than in any shared substantive,    or heuristic, value it may have (Becker; Jahn; Stiess, 1999). It makes sense,    then, to examine these discourses closely. It is the contention of this paper    that the idea of sustainable development, having achieved its majority, is now    being deprived of the full rights of an adult citizen. In place of radical new    openings, which force us to reconsider what is meant by sustainable development,    the term is usually attached uncritically to existing practices and policies    that might benefit from 're-branding'. In what ways might the re-consideration    of sustainable development lead to significant departures? </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Changes in global communication and genetics    have altered our relationship with the environment so substantially, that it    would be unwise to write them out of the 'nature' we describe as 'sustainable'. In the twenty-first century it makes sense to consider <I>ourselves</I>    as part of the discourse of sustainability. During most of the late twentieth    century sustainable development evolved as a set of observations about nature,    and our relations with it, but it was clear to many that the key to understanding    this were the relationships that existed <I>within</I> and <I>between</I> human    societies. 'Nature' as something external to us, provided a rallying point for    critics of economic policies that were clearly unsustainable. For others, dissatisfaction    with the anodyne way in which 'sustainable development' was described led to    a series of reflections about the human species <I>as part</I> of nature. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The re-emergence of market economics, and neo-liberal    policies in the 1980s, with which the measurement of sustainability is associated,    clearly marked a watershed for environmental politics. Increasingly 'sustainability'    was detached from the <I>environment</I>, and environmental sustainability was    confused with wider questions of equity, governance and social justice, which    served to shift political discussion to different quarters.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Earlier discussion of 'sustainability' and 'sustainable    development' had been preoccupied with <I>needs</I>, particularly (but not exclusively)    human needs. As the sustainability debate became more mainstream in the 1980s,    much of it was influenced by neo-classical economics, and an attempt was made    to translate environmental choices into market preferences, following neo-liberal    orthodoxy. Increasing attention to measurement was a necessary corollary of    this trend. A search had begun for practical ways in which sustainability could    be built in to existing policies and planning (Rydin, 1996). This broadened    the use to which sustainability was put, and opened up a new discourse around    development with appeal to policy professionals and business. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps in response to the incorporation of environmental    economics into more 'mainstream' policy, perhaps to compensate for a history    of neglect, much of the discussion of sustainability as a political process    was taken up by disciplines other than environmental economics. One consequence    is that the sustainability discussion moved, almost imperceptibly, away from    human needs, the original 'Brundtland' Commission's concern, to that of <I>rights</I>.    The emphasis on both human and non-human rights, in turn, drew the discussion    of sustainability towards other more 'orthodox' concerns of the social sciences:    questions of power, of distribution and equity (Martinez-Alier, 1995). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The preoccupation with policy notwithstanding,    the links between the environment, social justice and governance had become    increasingly vague in sustainable development discourses, and the structural    relationships between power, consciousness and the environment had become blurred.    In the search for a more inclusive view of sustainability, political rhetoric    has often replaced the discussion of environmental issues. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The sustainability debate reached the mainstream    as environmental, and other campaigning groups, sought to distance themselves    from neo-liberal solutions to environmental and social problems. However, environmental    discourses which claim precedence for 'rights', and which are conducted at high    levels of abstraction, and geographical aggregation, are often only loosely    connected with cultural choices and political decisions on the ground. At the    same time the criticism of market economics, which has characterised international    non-governmental organisations (NGOs) presents problems of its own. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Opposition to neo-liberalism is at its most effective    when it moves beyond a critique of institutions, to embrace new networks of    global communication. This was evident in the 'virtual', but very <I>material</I>,    opposition to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks in Seattle in 1999, and    later in the Washington street protests, in Prague and in the Netherlands the    following year. These 'anti-globalisation' protests coalesced around the view    that current economic growth is both socially regressive and environmentally    unsustainable. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These 'oppositional' discourses on the environment    represent the communicability of different codes, but frequently depend on the    same formal terminology surrounding sustainable development. They mark <I>practices</I>    of communication, which themselves carry symbolic and political meanings - 'democratic    power', 'empowerment', 'natural justice' - and which are seen by their advocates    as an alternative to the bankruptcy of elective democracy (Esteva, 1999). These new environmental discourses reflect changes in globalisation, genetic    engineering and the communicability of information via the Internet, all processes    which were much less developed at the time of the Brundtland Commission's report    in 1987. They also demonstrate vividly the importance of new spatial inequalities,    and the weakness of many existing social ties. In this sense they may be constructed    as 'post-sustainability' discourses. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The key to understanding new sustainability discourses    lies not only in their symbolic meaning but also in advances in technology,    and therefore communication, itself. The prime example is that of the Internet.    Another example is prompted by recent revolutions in both human and animal genetics.    At the same time as global communication is being revolutionised, radical changes    have occurred in 'nature' itself, which appear to have blurred the species barriers.    Species boundaries have become subverted and, in the view of some commentators,    the 'new biology' is altering what it means to be an individual, and to participate    fully in civil society (Finkler, 2000). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The formal challenge of the Earth Summit in Rio    de Janeiro in 1992 was nothing less than the governance of the global system    according to newly acknowledged sustainability principles. At the time this    meant the global environment, and the institutions that were established at    the first Earth Summit, soon became vested with expectations that they could    not possibly meet. Within the last two decades the global system has been enlarged    and reconstituted. Institutions such as the World Trade organisation (WTO),    the Human Genome Project and the World Wide Web, are now integral to it. They    are as integral to the global system as the Global Environment Facility or the    United Nations General Assembly. None were in existence in 1987. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this new global system territoriality is no    longer a necessary property of the environment, but a conditional feature of    it. It is not only shared territory which binds people together, and prompts    calls for universal rights to be extended to all. Persistent calls for 'natural'    rights to be protected, and for better governance of the environment, have to    be placed within a new context, in which the scales of justice have been widened    and, in which 'sustainability' is a property of different, contending, discourses.    The first of these contending discourses is concerned with 'globalisation' (Castells,    2000). </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Globalisation and sustainability </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Rio Declaration (Agenda 21, 1993) in 1992    reflected an increasing concern with global environmental issues: a concern    that was to lead to the establishment of a number of institutional mechanisms    to try and ensure that environmental problems could be managed more effectively.    Behind this concern were a number of assumptions. The first was that international    environmental problems - notably climate change and biodiversity loss - were    "&#91;...&#93; anomalies to the existing institutional arrangements of politics    and science, and their capability of dealing with problems" (Becker; Jahn;    Stiess, 1999, p. 284). Environmental problems had eluded the international system,    since they had not been predicted (in the main) and were difficult to control    through the orthodox instruments of financial institutions. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second assumption, on which the 1992 Earth    Summit itself was based, was that both North and South had a <I>shared </I>interest    in ensuring that future economic development was not prejudicial to the environment.    At one level this normative framework was very attractive: it marked a departure    from past divisions, especially post 1945, and an acknowledgement of the vulnerability    of the planet itself. This 'liberal consensus' approach is still the dominant    discourse surrounding key concepts like 'sustainable development', 'human security'    and 'global environmental change'. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, the discussion of globalisation carried    with it assumptions about the trajectory of global development that early critiques    of 'sustainable development' sought to challenge. According to Law and Barnett    globalisation: </font></p>     <blockquote>        ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Constructs the present as a moment, which is      part of a fundamental historical transformation. Globalisation has become      the grand narrative which justifies the end of all the other master narratives      of social change &#91;...&#93;. (Law ; Barnett, 2000, p. 55). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Globalisation had taken on the mantle of modernity    itself; it was the name given both to the journey modern societies are taking,    and their ultimate destination.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> From the perspective of the new century, policy    discourses of this kind are essential ideological underpinnings for concerted    action by national governments and international organisations (Baumann, 1998).    They translate ideas such as 'sustainability' into discursive terrain, providing    a framework that is largely absent from traditional international diplomacy.    They also suggest opportunities for different actors and groups to mobilise    around policies and, in the process, provide them with legitimacy. Different    actors are also able to elaborate and embroider these discourses, providing    ways in which it could be redefined, or deflected. These discursive narratives    have influenced the way in which international environmental policy and sustainable    development are viewed today, at distinct spatial levels (Milbrath, 1984). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can take a common example to illustrate the    point. Within international nature conservation the word <I>nature</I> is used    in a variety of different ways, to express social and economic interests in    the environment. Conservationists use it to mean an 'object', such as a habitat,    a field, a forest, wetland or reef. Environmental groups, however, have also    adopted 'nature' to express place-based identity; their own legitimate (natural)    environment. Finally, 'nature' is used in policy discourses to express a professional    judgement on the type or value of a resource - 'critical natural capital', 'biodiversity    hotspots, 'common-pool resources', ' natural sinks' etc. Each of these definitions    of nature provides symbolic meaning for different groups of people, and reflects    their different interests. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Similarly, in the case of tropical forest management,    we can identify several contrasting discursive fields, through which nature    is characterised, and conservation objectives are expressed. Protecting 'nature'    becomes synonymous with protecting environments, endangered ecological systems,    as well as the 'indigenous people' who inhabit these environments. Nor is it    always clear where these discrete interests overlap or diverge. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is another facet of the new discourses    surrounding nature that has received insufficient attention. Under globalisation,    discourse narratives frequently obscure <I>spatialised</I> social processes,    which remove and redirect biological resources from one location to another.    The tropical forest becomes, literally, a global resource, to be exploited at    several removes, and in the interest of 'science', as well as the market. Before    the benefits of bio-diversity can be commoditised and traded, they must first    be privatised, and their ownership clarified. This is the important, and highly    contested, domain of intellectual property rights. According to McAfee it is    built on shifting sand:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Contrary to the premise of the global economic      paradigm there can be no universal metric for comparing and exchanging the      real values of nature among different groups from different cultures, and      with vastly different degrees of political and economic power. <U>(</U>McAfee,      1999, p. 133). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These changes carry clear political consequences.    The processes through which globalisation is undertaken, and environmental agreements    made, involves highly unequal capital and information systems, to which groups    of people, and governments, have highly unequal access. Vogler shows how some    members of the international community wield disproportionate power: </font></p>     <blockquote>        ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In most &#91;...&#93; regimes &#91;...&#93; there &#91;is&#93;      fairly marked evidence of the way in which norms and rules emanating from      United States practices and legislation &#91;are&#93; translated to the international      level. (Vogler, 2000, p. 209). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is a paradox of globalisation that the deliberations    that accompany decisions to exploit genetic material in the wild, for example,    are rarely public property, in the way that political decisions were in the    past. A basic unease with these new realities has, in turn, stimulated new forms    of social protest, and new legitimacy practices. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Sustainable human futures? </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The political significance of globalisation discourses    is not confined to the individual, however. The environment, seen as a strategic    resource, can be managed in much the same way as 'non-aligned' status was negotiated    during the Cold War. To increase human security, supra-national organisations    might be expected to act with 'the global interest' in mind, since environmental    stability is perceived as a 'shared' problem, for the developed and less developed    world. The human security discourse is one of qualified support for interventions    which reduce environmental vulnerabilities, and in which the political nature    of this intervention is obscured. In entering the policy mainstream it provides    much the same purpose as the sustainability discourses which preceded it. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A central principle of the new global 'environmentalism',    then, is the role it affords the state and supra-national institutions. Ecological    systems and 'environments' leave the moral domain under this perspective, and    become things which the state, or supra state, must administer. This represents    a major shift away from the principle of national sovereignty, beloved by the    realist tradition of international relations theorists, and seen in the early    writing on 'sustainable development' as a barrier to progress. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the same time, the new 'sustainability' paradigm    around human security and the environment, assumes shared responsibility for    the environment. Ideologies of 'co-partnership' emphasise the benefits of better    management to both 'endangered populations' and ecosystems. Finally, although    the environmental security discourse apparently departs from the nation state    logic of the realist school, it builds upon the post War liberal consensus in    new ways. It provides a kind of neo-keynesianism for the global environment,    based on planning and international intervention. Terms like 'wise use', 'wise    stewardship' and 'sovereign property rights' echo the principles of ecology    for specific audiences, particularly those in North America, but they are held    to be applicable to the whole world. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Sustainable development and science </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is an assumption of international environmental    agreements; post Rio 1992, that objective, 'scientific assessment' will lead    to an enhanced profile for protected areas and species. Agenda 21 speaks of    </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#91;...&#93; Strengthening the scientific basis      for sustainable management... enhanced scientific understanding. Building      up scientific capacity and capability. (Agenda 21, 1993). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This, in turn, has led to increased efforts to    protect the environment through binding agreements. An example is that of the    <I>Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities</I>, which was prepared for    the 53<SUP>rd</SUP> United Nations General Assembly, in conjunction with the    Assembly's commemoration of the 'golden anniversary' of the U.N. Declaration    of Human Rights. Two of the nineteen principles of the Universal Declaration    of Human Responsibilities have particular bearing on the environment: </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a) Article 7 states "All people have      a responsibility to protect the air, water and soil of the earth for the sake      of present inhabitants and future generations." and    <br>     (b) Article 9 states "...(all people) should promote sustainable development      all over the world to assure dignity, freedom, security and justice for all      people." </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Westing (1999) argues that the UN Declaration    of Human Responsibilities should be a "&#91;...&#93; binding covenant"    in much less than the eighteen years it took the UN Declaration of Human Rights    (1948-1966) and that the World Charter for Nature (1982) should be transformed    in to "&#91;...&#93; a binding international covenant that explicitly guarantees    appropriate rights for nature <U>per se</U>" (Westing, 1999, p. 157). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact both these issues - the scientific basis    of the 'sustainability' discourse and the use of this discourse on behalf of    'natural rights'- requires closer attention. The belief in a 'global' science,    implicit in Agenda 21, is highly contested, not least by many scientists themselves.    What is brought to bear on global problems is a combination of different, discrete,    scientific traditions, rooted in different disciplinary traditions. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most of these discrete scientific disciplines    have nothing to say about the key issues, correctly identified in Agenda 21,    as "&#91;...&#93; the <I>linkages </I>&#91;...&#93; between human and natural environmental    systems &#91;...&#93;", and they are neither predictive nor prescriptive. The    idea of 'sustainability' is invoked in policy discourses, as speaking to objective    scientific method, without the complications of human judgement. In practice    it is routinely used as a way of guiding human actions. The very parts of the    scientific tradition, which have driven forward the frontiers of knowledge heuristically,    have imposed boundaries, taxonomies and categories on nature, and have been    used to make judgements, which reflect human concerns and political interests. The existence of global discourses on the environment and sustainability    is thus used to obscure the evidence and, by obfuscating understanding, such    discourses provide few clues to local meanings of environmental degradation.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Similarly, much of the rhetoric accompanying    sustainability fails to acknowledge that environmental and social objectives    are frequently different, and sometimes at odds with each other. These contradictions    are expressed, frequently voiced from sections of the 'aid' lobby, in the view    that <I>over-consumption</I> in the North is responsible for most global environmental    problems (Redclift, 1996).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Sustainable development and justice </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These problems pervade the growing literature    on 'rights' and the environment, as some commentators have noted (Dobson, 1998;    Miller, 1998). Today, 'natural rights' are usually translated as 'human rights'.    The idea that nature endows us with natural, inalienable rights, which governments    in some cases wish to deprive us of, is deeply embedded in the political consciousness.    The idea is there in the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as we have    seen, and has a history that extends backwards to the French Declaration of    Rights 1789, the United States' Declaration of Independence 1776 and the Bill    of Rights 1791. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <I>problem</I>, however, is that this sense    of 'rights' in a political sense, is derived from natural law, and is routinely    confused, in environmental discourses with 'the laws <I>of</I> nature'. These    laws - the canon of science - include the (increasingly contested) idea of homeostasis    in both biology and cybernetics, and the laws of thermodynamics, which express    the principle that physical processes are irreversible. Once they are regarded    as 'natural' such laws tend to be confused with the political and social implications    that follow from their adoption. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sustainability is a case in point. Andrew Dobson    notes that theories of sustainability "&#91;...&#93; sometimes make it subordinate    to justice, <I>but often the reverse is the case, and justice is looked upon    as subordinate to sustainability</I>" (Dobson, 1998, p. 241, emphasis added).    This subordinate position of justice in relation to sustainability is concealed    by the language of 'functionality', and it only comes to light when the 'win-win'    relationship commonly found in theories of sustainable development, is replaced    by a potential 'win-lose' relationship. It also comes to light when examining    <I>actual</I> cases, existing places and communities. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dobson also observes that, since neither sustainability    nor social justice has determinate meanings, this, "opens the way to legitimising    one of them in terms of the other &#91;...&#93;" (Dobson, 1998, p. 242). If    you view sustainability as sustaining households and people, then the distribution    of resources and rights in them is central to your objectives. If, however,    you view 'sustainability' as the protection and conservation of the environment,    then 'justice' consists primarily of ensuring it continues to play its vital    ecological function. At the moment we cannot say whether justice is either a    necessary or a sufficient condition for environmental sustainability.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> This observation, in turn, leads us to explore    the way in which the material world, and the constructions we place on it, is    mutually dependent and able to influence one another. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Nature engineering: sustainability as the    human subject </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first set of changes is in biology and genetics.    In a sense 'security' questions have shifted towards 'nature', forcing us to    reconsider what we mean by both 'sustainability' and 'security'. For example,    the protection of nature is now used to legitimate military action and, as we    have seen, assumptions about the global reach of nature management have become    enshrined in 'soft law', to which governments have signed up. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sustainability is no longer primarily a question    of maintaining, and enhancing, existing environmental resources; it is about    engineering new ones. The publication of the first results from the Human Genome    Project marks a watershed in the largely 'taken-for-granted' biology that underpins    most environmental politics: individual entitlements, citizenship and governance.    The new genetics is altering what it means to be socially connected, to participate    in civil society. And how do you 'govern' a new global system which does not    respect territory, a global system that is, in effect, increasingly extra-territorial    (Finkler, 2000)? </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bruno Latour has pointed to phenomena which were    neither 'social facts' in the Durkheimian sense, nor natural objects, "&#91;...&#93;    but emerge at the intersection of social practices and natural processes as    socially constructed forms of mediation between society and nature" (Latour,    1993, p. 11). Latour was referring to phenomena, such as C.J.D./B.S.E. ('mad    cow disease') or global warming, which are 'hybrids', incorporating elements    of the material and the socially constructed. In the future human genetics,    together with other systemic processes, may be poised to shift the ground even    further in the direction of mediation between 'nature' and 'society', to the    point where what we hybridise is not even perceived as <I>public</I> policy,    like global warming or 'mad cow' disease. The process of mediation will be complete    when it is least recognisable within a public domain, or a public discourse.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Where does this leave the 'environment', and    the political discourses which govern its management? As the <I>human subject</I>    itself is changing, then so might the notions of citizenship, democracy and    entitlements? In the new world materiality and consciousness bear an increasingly    complex relationship to each other. As species boundaries are eroded, and genetic    choice dictates policy, are the 'environment', and 'sustainability even valid    categories any longer? </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Conclusion </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This introduction began by asserting that since    'sustainable development' had reached mainstream international environmental    policy, it was time to draw breath, and to closely examine the political and    intellectual agenda that was being proposed. Since the term 'sustainable development'    was popularised by the Brundtland Commission in 1987, the natural environment    had been closely linked with meeting human 'needs'. Subsequently, the move from    an emphasis on 'needs', to that of 'rights', marked a shift from a broadly keynesian    paradigm of international economic relations, in the post World War II period,    to the neo-liberal certainties of the late 1980s and 1990s. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The imposition of market economics on the global    environment had both paradigmatic, and practical, results. The focus on 'choices',    for individuals and larger social groups, expressed through market preferences,    led to growing disparities between social and political demands, and the allocations    of the market. International political economy, in neo-liberal orthodoxy, meant    economic 'adjustments' had to be made for which there was little, if any, social    provision. Environmental protection, and the values that 'actually existing'    cultures placed in their environments, was formally expressed in terms of markets    and prices. Paradoxically, it was this emphasis on individual and group interests,    in the face of market forces, that has led to the concentration, especially    by the non governmental organisations, on 'rights' in their opposition to globalisation.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This essay then went on to examine the discourses    through which sustainability, and the rights to and of, nature, was expressed.    It was suggested that sustainability as a mainstream concept had often disguised,    in newer vestments, the conflicts and agendas of the past. As Habermas argued    in <I>Theory and Practice</I> (1971) the way that we understand 'nature' today    is framed by the past. The 'new' sustainability discourses were often clothed    in new language - deliberation, citizenship, even the rights of species - but    they hid, or marginalised, the inequalities and cultural distinctions, which    had driven the 'environmental' agenda internationally. We considered the way    in which environmental issues became a target for policy, and was elaborated    by different political actors, or discourse coalitions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> A critical look at sustainable development discourses    today suggests that the perceived need for global management of the environment    stemmed, in part, from the assumption that it provided a way of correcting the    anomalies of economic and trade policy. Two specific questions were identified    as evidence of the new discourses around sustainability, and the attempt to    incorporate within environmental concerns, wider questions of social justice,    governance and equity. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, it has been suggested that the increasingly    discursive nature of international environmental policy, and the attempts to    seek, or claim, legitimacy, presents other dangers. It ignore the fact that    the nature/culture debates are being materially rewritten via genetics. The    'scales of justice', with which environmental issues are now necessarily concerned,    needs to acknowledge that the human individual (like other species) is a genetically    modified being, and increasingly viewed as such. Global information systems,    led by the Internet, have transformed communication systems, and the symbolic    order, heralding a new, and uncertain <I>virtual</I> politics, parallel with    that of the 'real world'. It is in this sense that the new discourses surrounding    genetics may be looked upon as 'post-sustainability' discourses. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The essay began by arguing that 'sustainable    development' had for some time been a property of different discourses. The    term 'sustainable development' was an oxymoron, which prompted a number of discursive    interpretations of the weight to attached to both 'development' and 'sustainability'.    Only by exposing the assumptions, and conclusions, of these discourses could    we hope to clarify the choices, and trade-offs, which beset environmental policy,    and the environmental social sciences. Today 'sustainable development' needs    to be linked to new material realities, the product of our science and technology,    and associated shifts in consciousness. We have entered a world in which 'sustainability'    is understood in terms of new material 'realities', as well as epistemological    positions (Mol; Law, 1994; Touraine, 2003, Urry, 2003). The challenge for critical    thinking, then, is to identify the ways in which material changes - in the physical    environment, information technologies and the human body - require us to revisit    the idea of sustainable development. We need, in short, to examine the way in    which new materialities influence the cultural constructions we place on the    environment. To come of age, sustainable development might have to take issue    with many of the assumptions that influenced its adolescence.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>References </b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">AGENDA 21: programme of action for sustainable    development: Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.

AbstractIn this paper we propose a discussion about the place of literature in the construction of knowledge. Bearing in mind the assumption that scientific knowledge must be understood as a form of knowledge, but not as the knowledge par excellence, we put forward the question whether the literature could also be conceived as a form of knowledge of reality, even if it is not its function nor what defines literature as such. In this paper we try to analyze the relationship between literature, knowledge and society, from the cultural materialism, taking as empirical case study the formation of literature in Mozambique.

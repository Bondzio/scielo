Abstract This article discusses efforts at the University of Costa Rica since the 1980s to incorporate a gender perspective and stimulate feminist studies at this institution of higher education. The dynamic of the national context together with the efforts of the feminist movement and of Costa Rican institutions have created an environment propitious to the establishment of various laws and the ratification of international agreements that defend the rights of Costa Rican citizens and particularly to fight discrimination against women. The article reflects on the advances achieved in the university and reports on other studies about the presence of men and women in the fields of science and technology. It concludes that, despite a stronger female presence among undergraduate and graduate students, there are still inequalities in participation and the access to careers. Some fields in the basic sciences and technology, such as the engineering fields, have a lower presence of women. The university situation certainly provides material for reflection and analysis about how to create incentives and transform female and male participation in a more equitable manner.

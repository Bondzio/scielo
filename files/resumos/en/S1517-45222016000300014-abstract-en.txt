Abstract A central issue involving the matter of coloniality and post-colonialism refers to the production and circulation of knowledge and to epistemology. The current global crisis makes it urgent to deepen discussion on the coloniality of knowledge and the abyssal thinking that emerge from modern colonial experience and its logic, which divided the world into metropolitan and colonial areas, into civilized and uncivilized, relevant and irrelevant regions. In this introductory work, we synthesize the debates featured in the dossier Epistemologies of the South: struggles, knowledges, ideas into the future pointing out some of the issues for which it is urgent to find answers, and indicating what kind of dialogue can lead to such answers.

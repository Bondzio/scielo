Abstract The aim of this paper is to scrutinize the critiques made by the American philosopher Patchen Markell to the authors situated in the field of theories of recognition, reconstructing, through their questions, the works of researchers with which he proposed dialogue, and indicating through this procedure inconsistencies in their problematizations, arising from the fact that Markell has not evaluated properly the argumentative route adopted by these authors. The study takes, as central axis, the work Bound by Recognition, published in 2003 by Markell, and the analysis has even point out that despite the contribution made by the author with the proposition of a politics of acknowledgment, this theoretical project does not outlines as the panacea of problems associated with recognition, but it is characterized as a proposal inserted in the same agenda of the theories that was suggested to question.

This article focuses on questions concerning the configurations of the gender roles among the female and male storytellers at Brazil/Uruguay border, taking into consideration the role of the researcher in this context. The differences of gender were gradually revealing its importance in the study of the oral narratives and, consequently, in understanding the frontier society, in the context of the present ethnography. The sexual division of work, time and space present in the local social organization is expanded to the oral narratives as well as to their performances. I intend to explore how these aspects, on narrative contents and/or on the way they are told, are being constructed while these differences are being delimitated.

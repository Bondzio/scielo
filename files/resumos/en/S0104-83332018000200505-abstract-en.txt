Abstract This purpose of this article is to analyze how the visibility of young people who identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual, different (or in general terms &#8220;rare&#8221;) women has repercussions on educational experience in high school; and how schools contribute to the construction of sexualized bodies. The article is based on the results of an ethnographic study in a public school in the southern zone of the city of Buenos Aires, which serves middle and lower middle class communities.

This paper analyses conditional cash transfer programs from a gender perspective considering the relations between these policies and caregiving labor that women realize in poverty contexts. First, the article proposes a description of the underlying conceptualizations of women when these programs are designed, by taking references from two emblematic cases in Argentina: the programs Jefes y Jefas de Hogar Desocupados and Familias por la Inclusi√≥n Social. Then, the paper explores the strategies of care that women receiving conditional cash transfers take along. Finally, we analyze the way civil society organizations provide with care services to many sectors of the population and explore how caregivers experience many aspects of childcare.

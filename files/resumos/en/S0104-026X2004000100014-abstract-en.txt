The internal reports of MST and the many different publications about this Movement, produced in the last 20 years, reveal the processes and the many different issues that appeared among the dispute for a piece of land. Many worries have been added to the main concern that is about the lack of land. Ideas, practices and political concerns have emerged in this movement that is still in construction. This study is a critical exercise of reflection about the nature of these productions and of the quotidian relations about the endeavours of constructing new subjects. It tries to investigate how were the changes being constructed in the work, social and political relations as well as in the affective relationships of men X women, women X women and men X men inside the MST.

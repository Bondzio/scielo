Abstract This is an anthropological research about the Bolsa Fam√≠lia Program (PBF) recipients, reflecting on the increase of women&#8217;s human rights, a less prioritized subject despite the fact that women are the preferred recipients. We analyze repercussions of receiving BF in the productive trajectories of 12 women living in Coque. We describe their productive trajectories, marked by informal, vexatious and degrading jobs. Then, we relate passages of these trajectories linked to moments before and after joining the PBF, as well as examples of agency and autonomy performed by them, reflecting on empowerment processes. Finally, we argue that there could be greater potential for the process of autonomy in the productive sphere and consequent exit from the program, if integration with labor and income policies that address their life projects were effected. We conclude that the inclusion in the PBF does not make women drop or slow doen their search for work, demystifying the lazyness effect discourse.

Abstract The Submédio São Francisco, where the irrigated fruit culture area of Petrolina/PE-Juazeiro/BA is located, is frequently recognized as one of the regions with the highest economic dynamism in the Brazilian Northeast. Since the 1970s, the region has received successive public and private investment, leading to an expansion of formal wage labor, with a significant number of women among those hired. In this paper, we aim to analyze the significant inclusion of women as export viticulture workers in two respects: 1) highlighting the different conditions of this insertion and comparing it to that of men; 2) observing the extent to which women&#8217;s working conditions have become a bargaining subject and object for unions.

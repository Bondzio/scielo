Abstract: This paper is about the associative forms identified with family farm. The analysis is connected with rural development programs in Argentina. In this sense, we ask about the influence of the different group&#8217;s strategies of intervention in those programs and the possibilities to develop and persist in these associations, after the programs period of intervention. The paper adopts a qualitative methodological strategy and it is a study&#8217;s case approach related with the experiences of groups of honey producers and associations that have been developed in the frame of Prodernea (1999-2007) and Prodear (2009-2015) programs from a comparative point of view, both in the province of Chaco, Argentina.

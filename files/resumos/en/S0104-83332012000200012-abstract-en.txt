This article posits an interrogation about the ways in which it is possible to keep using, for academic and political purposes, the category "women" from a perspective that collects the contributions of the gender performativity theory proposed by Judith Butler, and the philosophy of multiplicity by Gilles Deleuze. Instead of appealing to a transcendent and binary gender distribution, we opt for an ethical way of keeping the term "women" as a radically open category. Following the track of the present social life of the category gives visibility to a multiple field of social subjectivities which offer themselves to others from a position of enunciation and corporal existence as "woman".

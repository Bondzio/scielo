This work discusses sexuality experimentations amongst a group of youngsters that participated in a health action in the field of sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS, coordinated by a non-governmental organization that fights for the respect of human rights and free expression of sexuality. This action, beyond the Aids epidemic prevention objective, allowed us to analyze the ways youth have experimented sexuality in homophobic Brazilian society. The study follows an action research approach and its results show some limits and possibilities of interventions directed to the youth regarding the access and the production of a sexual diversity respect culture and the consolidation of human rights.

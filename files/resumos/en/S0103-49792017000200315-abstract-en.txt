This article aims to analyze some aspects of central dimension in the phenomenon often known as globalization. The main objective is to understand the global monetary economy according to two fundamental categories of sociology: rationalization (Max Weber) and monetization (Georg Simmel). Based on this, we will present some ideas of the French-Swiss sociologist Aldo Haesler regarding the consequences of the electronization of monetary flow that is in the bases of globalization. Among other aspects, Haesler draws attention to the systematic correlation of three fundamental aspects associated with the global monetary economy: the invisibility of money, the painlessness of the sacrifice made in economic exchanges, and the dissolution of the reciprocal scheme of action.

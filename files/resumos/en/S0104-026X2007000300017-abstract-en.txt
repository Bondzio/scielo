Based on an experience as a member of the group that worked with the theme of migration of women at the Internationale Frauen Universit√§t (IFU) in 2000, this article presents a discussion about the migratory flows of women who work as domestic servants. There is a true globalization of assistance in this process, which even establishes chains between women of different nations, classes and ethnicities. The main causes of the migrations are linked to the struggle for survival and the opportunity to work, study and achieve independence from violence and oppression. I propose that, to contain migratory flows, public policies that meet the basic needs of the women in their countries of origin are necessary.

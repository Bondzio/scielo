This paper intends to consider a curriculum with the difference, as conceptualized by Gilles Deleuze, in order to shake the extracts of the already existing curriculums so as to give rise to a new one. It brings, as a means of experimentation, lines traced in an investigation which has mapped out the curriculum of three teachers working in three different schools. Concepts taken from the deleuzian thought on difference are used to establish virtual lines in the territory of the curriculum. The need to consider the curriculum with its bifurcations, escapes, variations and escape lines is defended. Difference is prioritized, as opposed to identity, and the ramifications that emerge from this thought are then followed up on. Its lines and traces aim to break the extracts of the already existing curriculums so as to enable us to observe difference doing its job. Last but not least, it means to operate with difference in such a way that the curriculum may be viewed as a multiple territory of summation, desire, extinction of territorial boundaries as well as cultivation of joys and affections.

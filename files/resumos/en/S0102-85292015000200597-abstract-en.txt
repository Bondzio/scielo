Abstract The idea of the different as other is in international relations an important aspect for the establishment and maintenance of these relations. While the pronouncements and statements of politicians and governments pass through political filters provided by legal professionals there are other cultural expressions that establish official but parallel discourses. As an example this paper presents the representations of the other in European postage stamps launched on the occasion of the celebrations of the so-called discovery of America. As theoretical reference, the investigation dialogues with the reflections on alterity or otherness provided by Tzvetan Todorov (1991) and Enrique Dussel (1993). As method we propose an analysis of the imagetic narratives of the stamps as expression of visual culture. The study identifies the dominant imagetic discourse and presents three alternative ones.

This article deals with the prevailing trend observed in humanities graduate programs linked to social/educational areas in Brazil, which maintain a predominantly Marxist-orthodox approach as well as an exegetical orientation character. In this sense, the observed trend is contrary to the global development of studies, which focuses on the relationship between education and work. In Brazil, books and authors that after the boom years of the Marxist 1960/1970 virtually disappeared from the international intellectual scene, are still predominant. As a consequence, any concept that is not in such literature is classified as "newspeak", term that originally condemned Stalinism, but was converted in order to denounce those who "look left", but are, in fact, simply "neo-liberals". As a result, this situation ends up restricting the freedom to think, something indispensable to the formation of true intellectuals. Also, not only the methodological, epistemological and statistical discussions are eliminated, but the empirical research as well, conditions necessary for statements no longer be the product of a Talmudic activity, relying instead on concrete field work

This article aims at developing the idea that each new capitalistic labour process produces an ideological and ethical rhetoric so as to legitimate a form that appears to be contradictory to the essence of political democracies, which is characterized by the fact that no one belongs to another. Taylor and Ford produced an important ideological effort to promote the allegation that no conflict of interests exists between workers and employers while they attacked systematically the workers resources within the forces struggle. The French modern managerial system follows the same path, leading an attempt to seduce and convince the wage earners on the one hand, though developing a strategy of subjective precarization on the other hand by a policy of perpetual changes in order to destabilize them.

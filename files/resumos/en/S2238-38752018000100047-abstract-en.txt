Abstract The article proposes to rethink the work of Florestan Fernandes at the intersection of the texts on &#8216;national formation,&#8217; certain analytic references originating from the sociology of culture, and studies of Brazilian social thought. From this perspective, it emphasizes the cultural dimensions of the author&#8217;s sociological output, based on his analysis of the constitution of modern values in peripheral societies like Brazil&#8217;s. Finally it revisits his contribution through the filter of the crisis of contemporary Brazil, seeking to elucidate questions intrinsic to our own era.

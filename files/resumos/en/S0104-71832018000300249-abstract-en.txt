Abstract In the face of the emergence of countless artists who constitute popular culture declaring themselves evangelicals, the main objective of this article is to investigate the meanings, styles and effects of their testimony narratives. More precisely, we seek to analyze how different media devices (books, television, internet) act in the production of their religious subjectivities, verifying how effective are the relations of pentecostalism with the mass media in the present day. Based on the case study of an evangelical celebrity, we seek to analyze more specifically how communicative technologies offer other meanings as we commonly know the manifestation of these typical Christian speech acts. In addition, we will also find out how the family universe becomes important in the construction of these witness narratives, thanks to a series of media connections established between the narrator and his kinship.

Abstract: In this article, it is presented ethnographic descriptions of a Social Assistance Reference Center (CRAS), from the Universal Social Assistance System (SUAS), with the intuition of understanding gender and sexual performativity within the National Social Assistance Politics (PNAS). The proposal to diminish gender inequalities is highlighted as one of the goals of these politics. SUAS recognizes women as the agents of social protection, especially in the familiar context. The way these politics have been organized, ends up performing feminization, through a &#8220;motherhood biopolitics&#8221; and it is operated, in a concrete way, in the practices reverberating directly in the subjectivity processes of its users as well as in the configuration of the administration of the familial and social relations.

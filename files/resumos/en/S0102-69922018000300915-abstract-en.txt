Abstract The study addresses the issue of media&#8217;s frameworks of collective action. Specifically, it is a methodological study, guided by the following question: How to develop an analytical model that ensures conceptual accuracy and methodological rigor to the study of media framing of mobilization processes? Therefore, the paper discusses the concept of media framework and presents the empirical construction of an analytical model based on the coverage of newspapers from Porto Alegre, Brazil about the 2013 protest cycles in the city. Finally, the study demonstrates the theoretical and methodological advances resulting from the use of the developed model.

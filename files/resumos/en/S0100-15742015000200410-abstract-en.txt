This article aims to discuss our professional experience with class diaries and portfolios in teacher training. The way they are conceptualized, what they are based on, how they could be organized by the students and what role they play as an instrument of educational practice were very important in the organization of this text. Based on a series of authors, we intend to show conceptually how these two instruments helped in teacher training from the perspective of visual culture. The researchers went through this experience in two different training environments, Brazil and Portugal, and each country's specificities and contextualization will be discussed here.

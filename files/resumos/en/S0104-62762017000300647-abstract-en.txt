Abstract The 1988 Constitution inserted the Public Defender&#8217;s Office in the Brazilian justice system in order to provide legal aid to people in need. At this time, the institution was a novelty in many parts of the country, and other institutional arrangements for legal aid were available in various places. This paper has analyzed the Constituent Assembly&#8217;s debate to identify patterns of conflict concerning the constitutional provision of a Public Defender&#8217;s Office. The debates reveal three avenues of objection to the standardization of legal aid through the Public Defender&#8217;s Office, which are institutional effects from previous state arrangements and from the centrality that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office was acquiring in the justice system. We observe that institutions and public policy, by influencing actors&#8217; aims and strategies, affect processes of institutional development and change. These findings contribute to the literature on Public Defense, which stresses the institution&#8217;s potential to promote social justice and the democratization of the justice system in Brazil. In spite of observing the institution&#8217;s incapacity to live up to its potential in practice, it isn&#8217;t able identify that this limitation is, largely, a consequence of the difficulty of inserting a Public Defender&#8217;s Office into an existing justice system.

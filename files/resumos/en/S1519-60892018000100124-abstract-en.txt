Abstract: As the result of a recently completed PhD research, this work aims to question gender regulatory norms present in the daily life of two young people who identify as gay. The interaction with the subjects occurred through on-line conversations held on Facebook, in which a dialogical and alterity relationship fostered the feeling of complicity and availability. This feeling thus generated a wide discussion around issues regarding heteronormativity and the experiences of abjection it produces. The on-line conversations were interpreted mainly in light of authors of gender and sexuality studies, and were theoretically supported by the perspective of queer studies. Conversations with both young people contributed to reflections on the (re)production of social stigmas in the school space and on the urgency of (re)thinking the planning of resistance strategies in school routines, in an attempt to demystify the naturalization and standardization of the supposed superiority and supremacy of heterosexual norms.

ABSTRACT Drawing on the report of my experience as a professor in a profitable private higher education institution in SÃ£o Paulo city, Brazil, this article presents an overview of who the students of this type of institutions are. It reflects not only on the social and economic conditions of these students, who constitute a quite diversified and unique university audience, but also on the working conditions of professors. In addition, it inquires whether there is room for teaching social sciences to students of other schooling backgrounds in a context of expanding access but no democratization of knowledge.

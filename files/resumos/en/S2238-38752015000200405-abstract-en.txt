Abstract When buyers come from another country and when many traders and workers live on the other side of the border, how does a marketplace function? The article analyzes the commercial dynamic of Ciudad del Este, an important market for imported goods located in Paraguay at the Brazilian border. Relating mobility, territoriality and temporality, the ethnographic description follows the actors' movement through the border during a working day and addresses other temporal and spatial relevant configurations. Considering that marketplaces presuppose a space and a time in which transactions occur, border marketplaces present a particular complexity, since they both reveal and relativize the space-time configurations of the State.

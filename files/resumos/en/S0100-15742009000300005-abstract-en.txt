This article reflects on gauchismo as one of the expressions of popular culture in Rio Grande do Sul. Its purpose is to characterize the Gaucho Traditionalist Movement as an organized cultural movement and to understand the dimensions of how traditionalists are educated in their territories, as well as the relations established by the movement with schools. The research was conducted based on fieldwork with participant observation in schools and in territories of gauchismo and traditionalism. The cultural industry appears as a plural resource for the popularization of the gaucho image promoted by the gauchismo movement.

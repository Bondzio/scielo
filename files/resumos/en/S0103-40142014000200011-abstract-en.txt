This work investigates how economic changes, from 2000 to 2010, in Brazil have affected the earning gap of migrants, return migrants and non-migrants. We use data from Censuses. Amongst the main results we found that being male, young and schooled elevates the probability of migrate and return in 2000 and 2010. Migrants and return migrants are better remunerated than non-migrants. The situation of workers improved in the period, given the growth of income and the decrease in income inequality, and migration appears to be connected with these changes.

Abstract This work puts forward the concept of global modernity starting from the observation of worldwide data. This concept seeks to provide an integrative perspective that takes multiple dimensions of life into consideration, on the basis of at least four interrelated dimensions: the individual, culture, the organism and social systems. The discussion of the concept is elaborated through a historical perspective on economy, as well as the examination of issues such as poverty reduction, the rise of the city, formal education, science and academia, among a variety of other fields, and illustrated by modern development and its speed. Comparing the changes that have occurred in recent decades to previous centuries, the text suggests that global modernity can be considered a sociological tool used to explicate the speed at which these changes occur, as well as their dimensions and consequences - thereby illustrating the context of global society.

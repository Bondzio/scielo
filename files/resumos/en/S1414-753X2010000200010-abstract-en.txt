Abstract: This article analyses the water resources management in Brazil considering: the public policies related to water resources; the public agencies involved; decentralization and conflicts over water appropriation. It demonstrates that the implementation of the new water resources management System in Brazil needs to overcome some obstacles and frames that had their origins in the old water resources management system, in order to reach a refined and mature system. This process will take a long time.

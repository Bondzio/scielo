Abstract The International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination became 50 years old in 2015. Based on what was stated and omitted in the main commemoration, the author - a member of the committee in charge of monitoring its implementation - evaluated both the advancement and the failures of that human rights treaty. While recording positive achievements, he equally noted the deadlocks and risks caused by so&#8209;called politically correct obsessions in the contemporary discourse. Far from overcoming ethnic and racial discriminations, such artificial attitudes give ammunition to minority radicals who aimlessly refuse integration, as well as to the increasingly racist "nationalism" of ethno&#8209;centric majorities. This speech can be changed, provided all the involved actors are conscious of its defects.

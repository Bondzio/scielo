This is a study on the way the soybean, which was introduced in Piauí Savanna, has influenced the environmental and social-economic axis. The factors that explained Piauí's land exploitation were: the low price of its agricultural land, its proximity to the external market, the viable mechanization of its soils, and governmental resources facilitated by financial and fiscal incentives. Therefore, the use and the agricultural exploitation of that region have followed the same developmental pattern of the Brazilian savanna.

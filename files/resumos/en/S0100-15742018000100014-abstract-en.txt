ABSTRACT: The studies of Bourdieu and Moscovici, in discussing the symbolic dimension of social phenomena from a critical and destabilizing perspective, have much to contribute to understanding current educational issues. Thus, this text aims to establish a dialogue between these authors to approach the educational field from a psychosocial perspective. It is based on three axis. The first, refers to the discussion of the psychosocial perspective as epistemological attitude, weaving reflections on a ternary reading of the facts and social relations. The second, highlights education as social practice, considering its purposes and social space. And the third, deals with the relationship between education and social change. Bourdieusian and Moscovician notions are thus recovered, contributing to resignifying educational practices from the psychosocial perspective.

Abstract This article has analyzed the drug disposal form by the population of Distrito Federal (DF), reflecting about its possible health and environmental risks. For that, an exploratory cross-sectional study was conducted based on interviews with residents of all Territorial Planning Units in DF. Among the 393 interviewees, 73.8% had a stock of medicines at home, 78.9% had already discarded drugs, which were mostly done in the common waste (73,6%). Adequate discharge was strongly associated with greater schooling (p = 0,027), higher economic classification (p = 0,005), male sex (p = 0,006) and with receiving information about the subject (p &lt;0,001). It is noted that the inappropriate disposal of drugs is common. It presents the need to incorporate the theme into specific policies and media.

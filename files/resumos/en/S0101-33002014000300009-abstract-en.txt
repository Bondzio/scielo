This paper provides an investigation on the delaying of reproduction in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, which is understood as the postponement of the birth of the first child of women older than 30 years of age. As a methodological strategy, we approached the issue by period and cohorts. Data on births were obtained from the Civil Registry. The Population Censuses provided the effective women's population size by age across the analyzed period (1960-2010). We verified that in the 1980 cohort the 30-39 fertility group increased its share in total fertility. Between 2000 and 2010, there was an increase in the share of childless women in all age groups. Fertility by birth order of the child showed an increase in the proportion of first-child births among 30-39 year-old women, indicating temporary or permanent postponement.

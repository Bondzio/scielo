This text tries to verify how the nation was constructed in Grande sertão: veredas [The Devil to Pay in the Backlands] by Guimarães Rosa, and Deus e o Diabo na terra do sol [Black God, White Devil] by Glauber Rocha. By analyzing authors as Homi Bhabha, Stuart Hall and Walter Mignolo, the text inquires how these authors had constructed the sertão (backland).

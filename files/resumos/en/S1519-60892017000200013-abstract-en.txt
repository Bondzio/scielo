Abstract: The purpose of this article is to introduce foundations of the epistemological proposal of JÃ¼rgen Habermas, which are found in his works previous to The theory communicative action. The text addresses the dispute between Popper and Adorno and then focuses on Habermas&#8217; proposal based on The analytical theory of science and dialectics. Finally, it discusses how Habermas portrays, in his debate with others contemporary authors, his proposal at Technology and science as &#8220;ideology&#8221;, considered a landmark for Frankfurt School.

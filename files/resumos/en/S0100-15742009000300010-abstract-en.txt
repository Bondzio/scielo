The objective of this work is to present the results of a brief bibliographic review concerning the common idea that adopted children often experience difficulties in school learning. Studies of how difficulties in learning arise in adopted children are quite scarce both in Brazil and internationally. Some of the few researches found make direct reference to the problems in learning for these children - usually relating these difficulties to the length of time children are in institutions. The literature in educational psychology has previously identified some symptoms associated with adoption - for example, problems in ego strength, low self-esteem, reduced intellectual functioning associated with behavioral problems, hyperactivity, and deficits in attention. However, these problems are not described with either depth or reliability. This suggests that there is a shortage, a vacuum of knowledge, requiring the execution of specific studies, which might make visible the actual magnitude of learning difficulties among adopted children and as well illuminate the factors that contribute (or that do not contribute) to these symptoms.

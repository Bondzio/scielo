ABSTRACT The 1988 Federal Constitution (FC) concluded a successful inclusive democratic transition, where paradigmatic shifts in social policies produced the inclusion of outsiders, a mechanism that not only reduced inequalities but also operated as a counterweight to the effects of the economic crisis. On the other hand, the FC 88 also designed a regressive tax policy. Striving for fiscal balance does not require breaking down inclusive policies.

In this article we aim to discuss the protection of traditional populations' knowledge in its close relation to natural resources preservation and the protection of the copyright. For that, we analyzed the understanding of protection that international organizations responsible for the heritage (UNESCO), for the environment (UNEP) and for the copyright (WIPO) have. The vision of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is also remarked. This set of multilateral agencies that deal with the subject indicates the complexity that involves the definition of legal rules for protection in this field.

This article presents reflections formulated from a study that sought to question the experience of women-mothers in the relationship built with their sons and daughters from the perspective of masculine and feminine. The strategy of deconstruction held the reading of texts produced by women-mothers seeking to prove the logic that underlies the phallogocentric attributes assigned to women and men as well as problematize binaries that support the pair feminine and masculine. The balance of forces acting on the unveiling of deconstruction and the effort barrier operated by the metaphysics of presence opens a route for the development of practices that shuffle the boundaries between what is to be in or outside the norm, expanding the possibilities of subjective experiences.

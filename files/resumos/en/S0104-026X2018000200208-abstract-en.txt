Abstract: Sharing the concept of advertising as a mediator in the formation process of subjectivities, this article seeks to reflect on the contributions of sanitary-pads advertisements in maintaining or shifting gender stereotypes. Therefore, our analysis is focused on three advertising campaigns produced in the last five years, whose repertoire differs from the traditional model of sanitary-pad ads: Break the Cycle, the Kotex brand; #Like a Girl, the Always; and Carefree. This analysis revealed that the ads cohabiting elements suggests both disruptions and continuities with the traditional gender stereotypes. From the category "Gender Places" and "Menstruation", this article discusses which are production possibilities of these new ads in generating other perspectives in those categories.

This paper seeks to explain the social and historical context in which conflicting interests regarding the question of water resources emerge in SÃ£o Paulo's metropolitan area. These conflicts have restricted or increased the available options of action to those involved in the process. We have pointed out some structural elements as well as the conditions built in a long term social process when the energy sector (Light & Power Company) commanded the use of metropolitan waters. The company limited the action of other sectors and motivated the emergence of new social actors. We have also pointed out how the emergence of environmental defense has happened at the same time of a change in the political pattern. New management styles entailed a tendency to the development of participating democracy - the river basin committees.

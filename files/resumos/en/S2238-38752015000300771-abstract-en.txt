Abstract The article analyses the reception of the work of Manuel Bonfim, circumscribing it in time and space. I follow the readings of Manuel Bonfim's works since his first book was published in 1905, and I seek to understand the periods in which his work was either forgotten or remembered. His nationalist posture, his analysis of Latin America, of Iberian parasitism, the defence of teaching national history - all of these are chapters in the career of Bonfim. In order to understand the success or neglect of an author or work, we must look beyond intrinsic value and pay attention to reception. The acceptance or recognition of an author thus depends not only on the quality of his or her ideas and of his texts, but also on variables related to the prevailing intellectual field in which the author is implicated.

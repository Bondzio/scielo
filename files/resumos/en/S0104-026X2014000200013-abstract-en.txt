This article explores an alternative genealogy to Western Occidental epistemologies by focusing on subaltern minority politics. We center on an analysis of the relationship between Lola Kiepja, considered as the "last Selk'nam" in Tierra del Fuego, and the anthropologist Anne Chapman. From a transdisciplinary approach, this work focuses on the domestic artistic productions - a feminine metaphor for the national - as a site of postcolonial resistance. From the perspective of a "Third Feminism", as presented by Bidaseca, we sought to reconstruct what Marta Sierra called the "mapa en ruinas" of such subaltern feminist epistemologies. Built on the gaps of a mestizo, hybrid feminism, in a state of "nepantlismo mental" made of "inherited, acquired, and imposed" elements, as stated by Gloria Anzald√∫a, we study different representations of this feminine (as the "minor", the "obscene" - that which is left out the social scene). Our ultimate goal is to reconstruct the genealogy of a transnational and postcolonial memory that crosses over different geographies and power maps.

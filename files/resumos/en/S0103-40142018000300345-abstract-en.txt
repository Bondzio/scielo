ABSTRACT This article describes the epistemological and methodological impasses that characterize the lack of interaction among historians of Science in the debate about their lines of research and affiliations. The enduring Positivist influence has precluded recognizing the value of scientific controversies, and the history of Science suffers this absence, which damages the perception of how science works.

This article analyzes the emergent trends that have been shaping economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region since 2004 resulting in the Trans-Pacific StrategicEconomicPartnership, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, the Free Trade Area Association of Southeast Asian Nations (China, Japan and South Korea), and the Pacific Alliance. This new configuration of strategic sub-regions has a double-sided dynamic: on one hand, a push for greater economic cooperation fostering regional free trade area in the Pacific Rim, and, second, the promotion of rivalries in these sub-regions according to the interests of the major powers in the region such as the United States and China. It also examines the participation of Latin American countries such as Peru, Chile, Mexico and Colombia in these agreements.

</front><body><![CDATA[ <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Editorial</b></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most of the texts in this edition deal with contemporary matters and situations, all of them burning issues that demand reflection and will to action. The opening dossier addresses the Neurosciences, but does so with eyes that heed not only pure research, but also their therapeutic applications. Problems - such as possible treatments for Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and epilepsy - are approached from an interdisciplinary perspective that is of great interest to modern readers and one of the goals of the Institute of Advanced Studies of the University of S&atilde;o Paulo (IEA-USP). The same is true for prescription drugs to control pain, this "phenomenon in the first person" that, nevertheless, is universal. Bringing this dossier to fruition was only made possible by the precious collaboration of professor Luiz Roberto Giorgetti de Britto, whom the editors warmly thank.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The risk of catastrophes and their eventual prediction is a powerful theme in this issue, and is dealt with both theoretically and empirically, e.g., in the study of the biological effects of radiation illustrated by the Goi&acirc;nia accident involving cesium-137, and in the dramatic photographs that reveal the vital damages caused by the Chernobyl accident. This brings us to the second dossier, which touches upon a recurring topic in this journal, namely, an appropriate energy portfolio for Brazil, from which energy produced by nuclear power plants should be excluded. This issue also carries articles on <i>wind energy</i>, that is emerging as one of the clean and sustainable alternatives for the next decades.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The more general principle of sustainability bestrides texts of an ethicalpolitical nature that examine the dimension of justice in the allocation of oil royalties, the rights of rural workers in sugarcane plantations, and the growing and perverse financialization of the Brazilian economy, still unable to overcome its foreign dependence.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Continuing with our series of interviews, we have the privilege of publishing the testimony of F&aacute;bio Konder Comparato, a tireless advocate for human rights. Lastly, the resilient oeuvre of Otto Maria Carpeaux and a reflection on the romanticism of Sarmiento lead us to horizons where, through various if not opposing pathways, culture embraces politics.</font></p>      ]]></body>

Argumentative disputes regarding the autonomy of the Judicial Power and its engagement with other political institutions mark the notion of judicial independence as a condition for judicial impartiality. It is also important to stress that a historical inquiry concerning the participation of legal experts and judges, in particular Brazilian Supreme Court magistrates, on the process of constructing their own political-institutional space, unfortunately, still occupies a mitigated importance in social scientist&#8217;s findings when dealing with the access to justice in Brazil. This paper seeks to combine the analysis of the influxes from the dictatorship period, concerning the Supreme Court&#8217;s functions under the Constitutional commands, and the magistrates' declarations about their own institutional role during the dictatorial regime. It also aims to bring some relevant historical aspects to a better understanding of the complex relationship between politics and law, in which disputes for the Supreme Court&#8217;s autonomy were drawn in the period of civil-military dictatorship in Brazil.

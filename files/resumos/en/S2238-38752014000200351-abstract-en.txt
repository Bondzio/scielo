Abstract In this paper, which focus on my own researches on the development of Anthropology in Argentina, two of the first works by Marcelo Bórmida that are openly ethnological and phenomenological will be analysed in order to explore certain relationships from the point of view of ethnology with Viveiros de Castro's work and from that of phenomenology with Tim Ingold's propositions. With this aim in view, the scope will be broadened so as to include other Argentinean anthropologists who are linked to Bórmida, as well as anthropologists and social scientists from the Anglo-Saxon and French academic field. The comparison seeks to find similarities and differences, but also to show the extent to which the perspectives of Viveiros de Castro or Ingold, as well as Bórmida's, are based on "residues of non-traditions".

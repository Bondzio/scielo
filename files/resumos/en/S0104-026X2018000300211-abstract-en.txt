Abstract: This paper intends to investigate the dialectical operation that Calypso elaborates (Part 5 of the Odyssey - Return), while told by the gods (Zeus), against her will, to let Odysseus follow his path to Ithaca. The analysis is conducted in the light of gender and feminist studies. The passage under analysis may be included as one of the major Western records of gender relations, especially among the other passages of the Odyssey as a whole. In a few words, this passage indicates the dialectic overcoming of non-hegemonic status of women from the gender intransigence.

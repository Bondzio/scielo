Abstract This article intends to offer a map of the academic studies of the Brazilian political thought within the Brazilian Political Science. In the first section, the paper explains the reasons for their terminological uncertainty and asks its conceptual meanings as object and subject. As an object in the broadest sense, Brazilian political thought refers to the set of ideologies that Brazil's political culture is made, presented in a "peripheral" writing style. From a strict point of view, that expression refers to the "classics" of our theory or political science, written before the university institutionalization in the 1970s In the last section, we consider the political thought as a university discipline devoted to the study of history of political ideas in Brazil, describing their development, their interpretations, their most notable researchers and their main research groups, according to their methodological approach based on Mannheim, Luk√°cs and Gramsci. The article concludes by suggesting a closer relationship between Brazilian political thought and general political theory.

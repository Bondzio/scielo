Abstract Abstract: The paper focuses attention on the historical development of sociology as a field that can be analyzed using the tools of historical sociology. First, the work highlights the historical process of nationalization of research and training in sociology, in an attempt to transcend methodological nationalism. This is accomplished by studying national events as if they occurred endogenously, without the interference of international factors. Next, the text highlights the process of internationalization of sociology that intensified in the post-war period, in which the existence of a structure of academic power relations between the sociologies of different nations is seen, due to the material and symbolic conditions within the different countries.

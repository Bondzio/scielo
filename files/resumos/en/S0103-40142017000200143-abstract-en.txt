ABSTRACT Governments, like many other large organizations, still work within a framework developed over a hundred years ago, with hierarchy, centralization, and expertise as its main features. This arrangement, which that has enabled remarkable advances in the productivity of manual labor throughout the twentieth century, progressively loses its effectiveness when confronted with a globalized and sophisticated economy, centered on knowledge, creativity, and the use of revolutionary technologies and materials in a plural, demanding and networked society. In this paper, we try to detail the main bottlenecks that prevent the public sector from giving effective answers to complex problems, and point out the changes needed for innovation to be captured by government &#8220;radars&#8221;, currently aimed at a society that no longer exists.

ABSTRACT This article identifies and discusses several cognitive movements that are fundamental to DADOS journal sociology collection. Employing ideas on the dynamic of functional differentiation in the sociology of Niklas Luhmann as a general means of reading the survey data reveals the central role played by political sociology in the collection, which is the most common field of specialization. The discipline leads a movement which both differentiates itself from the rest of the articles published while altering the sphere, due to the resonances it imprints on the other specialist fields within sociology. Such a reading also highlights the role played in the collection by the reflexive self-description practiced by social and political thought, which has served as the second most common field of specialization over the 50 years since the journal&#8217;s first publication.

This paper introduces a conceptual model which relates intra and extra school factors to elementary school students' achievement. Using this model as reference, the main evidences from the literature on how to improve student's achievement were reviewed. However, it should be noted that several of the results published in the international literature haven't been replicated with data collected in Brazil. The best Brazilian data to study these questions are those from Brazilian System for Evaluation of Basic Education - Saeb. Considering the low level attained today by the Brazilian students, there are several actions, which can be taken at the school level that, if applied, will impact positively on the student's achievement. At this point in time, it is strategic to emphasize school policies, considering, however, that they only will be viable with the implementation of school autonomy, idea already present in law, but not completely put into practice.

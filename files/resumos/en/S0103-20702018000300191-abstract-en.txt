Abstract The purpose of this article is to analyze the (re) definitions that occurred in the differential management of illegalities in Rio de Janeiro favelas since the Pacifying Police Units were launched. Based on an ethnographic fieldword carried out in the first two &#8220;pacified&#8221; favelas, I mapped out the UPP&#8217;s outcomes on the modalities of presence, modes of action, and interaction between police and youth engaged in the illegal drug trade. I defend the hypothesis that monitoring, negotiating and confronting are the main modalities for the management of illegalities in Rio de Janeiro favelas. And I suggest that analyzing variations and combinations of these modalities is fundamental to understand the force fields that are set in &#8220;pacified&#8221; favelas and, consequently, to analyze the process of rise and fall of the UPPs.

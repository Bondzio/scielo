Abstract The present work analyzes the theoretical contributions of Pierre Bourdieu and Bernard Lahire in the construction of a sociology of practice, highlighting their efforts to overcome the dichotomies that divide the main sociological theories - between objectivism and subjectivism, individual and society. In this sense, I will present the paths traced by them to think about human agency through a dispositional theory of action, emphasizing class habitus or individual dispositions. Last but not least, I discuss the progress and limits observed in these perspectives in grasping the central issues of contemporary social theory, such as the reflexive capacity of actors and their role in the reproduction /transformation of the social world. This analysis allows us to question to what extent the authors can overcome these dichotomies, because they emphasize, ultimately, the weight of the social on the individual conduct.

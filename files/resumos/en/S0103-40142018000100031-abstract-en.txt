Abstract The Portuguese colonization of Brazil had many congenital flaws, such as the predominance of private over public interest; the fact that Brazil was the main destination for criminal exiles during the Portuguese empire; the widespread corruption of civil servants and politicians; and a relationship of patronage between citizens and rulers. All the above characterize an oligarchic political system, formed by an alliance between private economic rulers and leading State agents, whereas the people remained always aside from the important decisions.

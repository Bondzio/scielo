This article proposes to discuss the so-called &#8220;territory effect&#8221; comprehended as the benefits or losses that affect some social groups in consequence of its localization in the urban space. In order to do so, it is analyzed how the place of residence interferes with the access and the incorporation in the labor market based on a research made in the third largest Brazilian capital, the city of Salvador. Firstly, this article directs itself to the previous literature about this phenomenon and, then, to the current discussions about the adverse impacts of segregation. It is also presented the specificities of the city of Salvador from the point of view of the occupation and the differentiation of its territory and of its occupational conditions. Finally, based on RAIS and Censo 2010 special tabulations properly spatialized, this study emphasizes how the &#8220;territory effect&#8221; operates adversely to the population that is concentrated in the poor periphery, more distant and less occupied, in addition to other factors. This fact also contributes to the occupational vulnerability of their residents and to the reproduction of social inequalities.

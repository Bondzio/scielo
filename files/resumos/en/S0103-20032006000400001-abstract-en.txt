This paper estimates the impact of an increase in Brazilian sugar and ethanol demand for exports upon the countries overall production and employment. The impacts were simulated considering each of the major cane producing areas of the country (Center-South and North-Northeast). An inter-regional input-output matrix for the Brazilian economy was used for that purpose. It was observed that a demand shock, resulting from an expansion of sugar exports presented an impact of greater magnitude upon the countries production and employment when compared to the impact from an increase in ethanol. In addition, the results indicated that when the impact is generated at the North-Northeastern Brazil, production and employment is more affected than when it begins at the Center-South region of the country. The result of how the economic benefits are propagated, is important to identify policies and establish targets for regional production.

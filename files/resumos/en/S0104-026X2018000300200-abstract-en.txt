Abstract: The article aims to examine how the traditions of classical Marxism and anarchist feminism of the nineteenth century to the early twentieth century understood the issue of prostitution, connecting it with specific views on gender relations, on sexual autonomy and on ways to overcome the oppression of women workers. Recognizing the diversity of perspectives and relative limits, the critique of the institution of prostitution will be developed based on the need to overcome the capitalist system of production, the dismantling of bourgeois institutions like family and marriage, the construction of egalitarian social relations, based on solidarity and as a form of female emancipation.

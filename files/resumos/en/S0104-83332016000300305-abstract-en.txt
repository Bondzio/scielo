Abstract In the line of research that studies science and gender relations, this article reflects on scientific research conducted by Marta Vannucci at the Oceanographic Institute of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IO-USP). Marta was a researcher recognized in her time, but has not received the attention she deserves, which has impeded the dissemination of her work. Her research was dedicated to the study of plankton and her field trips led to the publication of various articles in the IO-USP Bulletin. These articles demonstrate her commitment to the production of knowledge and active participation that allowed her to conquer space and recognition in the Brazilian university environment.

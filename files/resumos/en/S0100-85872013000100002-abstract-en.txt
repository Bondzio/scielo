Based on a recent ethnographic field-work among the Embera-Chami in the multi-ethnic region of the Cauca Valley (Colombia), the analysis of what occurs in interethnic meetings organized under the multicultural legislation will illuminate the paradoxical inerdependance between the institutionalized concept of "culture", a culturalist singular entity, and the political homogenization of ethnic groups. The state control of interethnic relations, along with the competition for visibility between groups of equal status under the national and international law appear as emerging dimensions of the interethnic field, while the performative role of ritualization of the circulation and appropriation of discourses and practices is confirmed. The sequence of events described, very common in other parts of Colombia, also demonstrate that the multi-directionnal appropriation and the contextual use of generic concepts issued in the academic milieu (national and international) such as "traditional physician", "ancestral rights", "cultural reinforcement", or "shamanism" construct a field of paradoxes. Thus, they allow the ethnic actors to build up and make visible an isolationist cultural singularity, conforming to the officialized notion of "culture", while forcing in the same time a broader opening of the interethnic "zones of contact", where a larger variety of practices and discourses circulate, much larger than before multiculturalism was instituted.

This article concerns the questioning of cultural values among farm families and specifically presents various representations that have been constructed by young people and women about the notion of marriage. To discuss the meaning, importance and the redefinitions currently being established about the category of marriage, an analysis was conducted of the statements of the sons and daughters of farm families collected during my doctoral research in western Santa Catarina state. Based on the analysis of the representations and actions of rural youth, an emergence of conflicts was identified concerning the choice of family models and marriage. This has influenced the life plans made by young men and women and gives importance to the factor of gender in the migratory movement of youth.

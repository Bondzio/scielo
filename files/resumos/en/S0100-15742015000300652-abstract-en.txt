This article discusses how early childhood education is shared between families and educators, in pre-schools. The investigation consisted of qualitative research, by means of an ethnographic case study, conducted in 2010 and 2011, in a Centro de Educação Infantil - CEI (Early Childhood Center-ECC), a public municipal school in São Paulo, which accepts children aged from 0 to 4 years. The methodological procedures combined participant observation, document analysis and semi-structured interviews with the CEI team and with the families. The results showed that the relationship between educators and families is permeated by conflicts and, for the establishment of a partnership, it is necessary to promote actions to ensure an ongoing dialogue about collective education of children.

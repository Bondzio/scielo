ABSTRACT In this article we show how Bourdieu&#8217;s epistemology is relevant for analyzing the problem of learning disabilities in mathematics, both from the theoretical and the methodological points of view. We looked at two different educational contexts that, nevertheless, share certain phenomena related to students with learning disabilities in France and in Quebec. The constitution of a social or school category and the creation of institutional arrangements ensuring continuity lead to a naturalization of the social and a psychologization of actors attributing explanatory individual characteristics to their &#8220;problems&#8221;.

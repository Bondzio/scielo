The purpose of this article is to show that the ecosocialist proposal is part of a set of concerns related to revolutionary romanticism and the critique of progress. It is, to use a notion so dear to Löwy, to find the elective affinities that exist between revolutionary romanticism, criticism of progress and ecosocialism. Therefore, in this exhibition, we always emphasize the ecological implications of the reflections of M. Löwy or that derive from the authors and problems that he has studied.

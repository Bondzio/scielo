Abstract The aim of this article is to prospectively review forms of symbolic demarcation based on the analytical category of derecognition. in Axel Honneth's theory of recognition but departs significantly from it. Thanks to this movement, it will be able to pay attention to the often overlooked dimension of negative relations of recognition, in which privileged groups or individuals manage to exert social power over other groups or individuals, whose social position is weaker, thus impeding these latter totake part on the symbolic spheres of recognition, which build up modern societies. Accordingly, such practices of symbolic demarcation of social barriers will be exposed as tendencies towards the undermining of the normative core of modernity (namely, its principles of equality and participation). Two cases will be exposed at length, in order to make the situation understandable: the problem of group stereotyping through group-focused animosity and the problem of second-class citizenship in Brazil.

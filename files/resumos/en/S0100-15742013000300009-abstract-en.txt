This article discusses the production and diffusion of representations of motherhood, based on social inclusion policies in contemporary Brazil. It is anchored in the notion of "politicization of women and motherhood", which refers to a discursive network that delineates pedagogies which, while educating women as mothers, place them alongside the State. Thus, they become co-responsible in coping with structural issues of poverty, since they are presented as strategic partners who must act decisively in resolving broader social problems. In this way, women-mothers are positioned in numerous social inclusion policies as key agents for solving social problems.

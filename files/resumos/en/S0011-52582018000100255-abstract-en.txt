ABSTRACT The following article analyzes 4,459 social sciences and humanities journals in Argentina and Brazil in order to detect segmentation in circulation associated with their disciplinary affiliation, accessibility-visibility and their political-institutional framework. The concept of publication circuits is proposed as a tool of analysis for advancing beyond the logic of indexing and to problematize references associating &#8220;excellence&#8221; with a particular scientific journal based on its inclusion in certain databases and repositories. The information processed indicates strong segmentation among local circuits, with most journals of scant visibility and published by traditional universities in paper format, a small number of limited access inserted in mainstream circuits, and finally, another large group characterized by easy access and regional circulation.

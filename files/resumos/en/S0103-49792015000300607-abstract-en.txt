The authors analyze the social-environmental conflicts played by the offshore platforms construction company Quip S/A and the fishermen of Santa Tereza neighborhood in the city of Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. Besides consulting secondary sources, the fishermen were interviewed. Além da consulta de fontes secundárias, se realizaram entrevistas com os pescadores da comunidade. From the Lefebvrian view on social space, it was possible to demonstrate that the so-called social-environmental conflicts express contradictions of the social space; many times, this character is hidden in the environmental discourse.

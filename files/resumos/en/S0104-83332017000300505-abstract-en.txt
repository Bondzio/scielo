Abstract Focusing on Kati Horna&#8217;s and Margaret Michaelis&#8217; photographs made in Spain, this paper intends to discuss some aspects of the gender issue in history of photography, as well as analyse some of the possible relations between the feminine participation and the political culture of that moment. They were born women and Jewish, and made themselves photographers and anarchists during the 1930s. They are part of a generation of women who found in photography a possibility of, at the same time, be financially independent, have an artistic and creative work, and take political action.

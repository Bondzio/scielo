It also analizes the labour expectation inside Italian families, as a scenario that allows its possibility. Furthermore, this investigation intends to demonstrate that mixed marriages reveal multiple subjective horizons, discrimination, ethnical social networks, cross-border integrations and family reconfigurations.

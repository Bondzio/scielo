Neotropical rivers suffer effects of human actions. Conservation measures are based on data from other regions because few studies in this region and limnology knowledge. But it's often inability to realize differences in the environmental variables answer at different scales about aquatic communities. This study aimed: to know aquatic insects richness in a neotropical microbasin to check the environmental variables influence on the distribution of aquatic insects families in four tributaries of this microbasin and to check the rate distribution pattern of aquatic insects families between different rivers orders and different microbasins, according to environmental and spatial variables influence. We found 9,135 individuals belonging to 26 macroinvertebrates families. The communities structure were differed between microbasins. The aquatic insects families were influenced by different spatial and environmental variables in each microbasin.

From studies of professional identity we propose to use gender as a category of analysis to know the main demands made to the teachers and how they affect, influence or determine their occupational performance as teachers. Conceiving the teaching professional identity as a construction at the same time individual and collective, the article describes the features that take these demands and analyzes tensions that, in terms of factors of occupational risk for health and well-being, have their origin in the design and implementation of the policy of evaluation of the performance of the teachers in Chile. In this regard, we consider that it is urgent to start an in-depth analysis of these policies in order to direct them towards a vision that includes inter-subjective and subjective aspects of women.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the Brazilian    participation in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission in 1946, Brazilian    foreign policy has given special consideration to nuclear issues. In the last    sixty years, with democratic and military governments, one of the country's    goals was the development of an autonomous nuclear industry through the acquisition    of technology for enriching the uranium found in the country. Brazil was a persistent    opponent of the unequal non-proliferation agreement that divided the world into    two groups of countries - those with and those without a nuclear military capability,    and which reflected the order established by the two Cold War superpowers. The    end of the bipolar system marked an important change in the Brazilian attitude.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the process    of democratization and the change in the international system, Brazil gradually    adhered to the regimes of nuclear non-proliferation, eventually signing the    Non-Treaty in 1998, and becoming one of the most significant supporters of global    disarmament and denuclearization.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the presidency    of Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva (2003-2010), the nuclear questions continued    to have crucial importance for an emerging country such as Brazil. Brazilian    diplomacy in fact had played a prominent role in the international negotiations    involving atomic issues. Indeed Itamaraty (the Brazilian Ministry for Foreign    Affairs) participated not only in the initiatives for strengthening the NPT,    with the 2005 and 2010 review conferences, but recently brokered a nuclear deal    between the nuclear weapon states (NWS), as well trying to revive the talks    with Iran, which has been accused of developing a clandestine nuclear military    program.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus nuclear diplomacy    has represented a fundamental part of President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula Da Silva's    strategy to make Brazil a central player in the international system, in addition    to the long-standing ambition of obtaining a permanent seat in the United Nations    Security Council. Functioning as a <i>bridge</i> between the North and the South    of the world, Brazil has maintained cordial relations with Washington, both    under the George W. Bush and the Barack Obama administrations, even if the Brazilian    President and his Foreign Minister Celso Amorim expressed national autonomy    in terms of US actions. Furthermore the President has implemented forms of strong    South-South cooperation through new forums search as the BRIC countries (Brazil-Russia-India-China),    the IBS countries (India-Brazil-South Africa) and other instruments of bilateral    and multilateral diplomacy in the global and regional context.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The object of the    present article is to analyze the Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's position    on nuclear issues through the analysis of the major actions of Brazilian diplomacy    during the last eight years and the implementation of a national nuclear program.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Aspects of continuity    in the Brazilian nuclear diplomacy from Cardoso to da Silva</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the years before    his election the President expressed a strong criticism of ex-President Fernando    Henrique Cardoso's decision of adhering to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. As    Presidential candidate of the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT - Workers' Party)    in 1998 and 2002 Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula Da Silva considered that policy to    represent adhesion to an alignment with the United States and with an unequal    international order represented by the treaty<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a>.    The action that the current President has taken during his administration has,    however, revealed a substantial weakness in those statements that represented    more electoral rhetoric than an actual plan for his international agenda, even    if prominent members of his cabinet and in Brazilian diplomacy released controversial    declarations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In fact the Minister    of Science and Technology, Roberto Amaral, resigned in 2004 after implying that    Brazil should not forgo the possibility of obtaining nuclear weapon technology<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>.    Some years later, in 2006, the Ministry of Foreign Relations issued a note in    order to deny any possible withdrawal from the NPT after the presumed statement    of Ambassador Samuel Pinheiro Guimar&atilde;es, then Secretary-General of Itamaraty,    about the future permanence of Brazil within the international agreement<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a>.    Finally, recent personal declarations of the Vice-President of Brazil, Jos&eacute;    Alencar, about the necessity of having an atomic bomb in order to join the club    of the great powers caused much international controversy that forced the Government    to distance itself from Alencar's position<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>.    Notwithstanding these personal positions the President has confirmed the Brazilian    commitment to the idea of nuclear non-proliferation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a long process    following the end of the Cold War and the establishment of a mutual trust with    Argentina, Brazil adhered to the main international nuclear non-proliferation    agreements. Between 1991 and 1994 Brazil created a bilateral nuclear non-proliferation    agreement with Argentina through the creation of a bi-national agency for accounting    for and controlling nuclear materials (ABACC-Ag&ecirc;ncia Brasileiro-Argentina    de Contabilidade e Controle de Materiais Nucleares). It became a model for other    regions and the 1994 IAEA-ABACC-Argentina-Brazil agreement imposed inspections    and a full system of safeguards on every nuclear activity in both countries.    It created an regime equivalent to the NPT for the two countries in a period    when they still opposed the global treaty.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The move toward    inclusion in international agreements continued in 1994 when Brazil became a    full member of the Latin American Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone, modifying the reservations    posed in 1967 to its participation. Brazil reiterated its formal renunciation    to its right to cause peaceful nuclear explosions and above all implemented    the Tlatelolco agreement<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil was the    last major country to adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),    when it ratified the treaty in 1998. This marked the end of the so-called <i>"golden    decade"</i> of the NPT that began in 1986 with the US-USSR Reykjavik agreements    and ended in 1998 with the Brazilian decision<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a>.    In those twelve years many nuclear powers became parties to the treaty or adhered    to it, renouncing all nuclear ambitions. France and China, the other two official    NWS (Nuclear Weapon States) recognized by the NPT, entered the agreement in    1991 and 1992, respectively. The end of the Cold War and the removal of any    nuclear external threat, along with the process of full democratization, led    South Africa, with an undeclared military nuclear program, to dismantle its    military arsenal and join the NPT in 1993<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a>.    President Menem of Argentina, took a similar decision in 1995 some months before    the beginning of the NPT Review and Extension Conference. The decision to extend    the treaty indefinitely, along with the US and Russian commitment toward general    nuclear disarmament, created a situation that in 1995 relegated Brazil to a    small club of opponents to the NPT whose main participants were India, Pakistan    and Israel, countries with a nuclear military capability not recognized as atomic    powers by the treaty.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although its criticism    concerning the unequal nature of the NPT remained valid, Brazil had to enter    it because both of the changed international context and the growing international    consensus around the treaty. As President Cardoso's Foreign Minister Lampreia    stated, adhesion to the treaty was a matter of concern for Brazil because it    represented, in a period when a possible reform of the Security Council appeared    close and Brazil was a possible candidate for permanent membership, a strong    lack of international credibility for a democratic government. The decision    taken by the couple Cardoso-Lampreia was shared by the majority of the Brazilian    diplomacy. As a consequence, in 1997 the Brazilian Government signed the Treaty    and ratified it in 1998.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new Brazilian    attitude towards non-proliferation appeared clear when the international regime    was seriously threatened, that is to say when the nuclear tests by India and    Pakistan took place in May 1998. Brazil joined a coalition of non-nuclear states    from the North and the South of the planet calling for an end of Indian and    Pakistani nuclear activities and for the full accordance with NPT objectives,    such as renouncing nuclear weapons and the immediate adhesion to the agreement.    The NAC (New Agenda Coalition) composed predominantly of medium-sized powers,    became the origin of many proposals for global denuclearization. The centrality    of Brazil in that context was evident by its active participation in discussions    about a world free from nuclear weapons, with a commitment that remained constant    in the passage between the administrations of Presidents Cardoso and da Silva.    Brazil, as an NAC member, was one of the main proponents of the 13-step grading    progress toward nuclear disarmament. The proposal represented the core of the    final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference and permitted the main nuclear    powers to escape political deadlock.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Continuing President    Cardoso's policy, Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva and his new Foreign Minister,    Celso Amorim, maintained nuclear non-proliferation as a central goal of Brazilian    foreign policy. In 2003, some days before the inauguration, Brasilia criticized    the North Korean decision of withdrawing from the NPT and requested its immediate    re-integration in the agreement<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The necessary conservation    of the agreement in all its aspects became a strong commitment on the part of    Itamaraty and it was confirmed by the election of Ambassador Sergio de Queiroz    Duarte as President of the 2005 NPT conference review. Despite Brazilian activism    for reaching a consensus as had happened in 2000, and despite several months    of preparatory works, the conference ended without a final document because    of an impasse connected to North Korean and Iranian issues, and to the negative    attitude of the United States and Russian governments towards effective disarmament<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The efforts in    this field of the da Silva administration were recognized in 2007 when the United    Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced the appointment of Ambassador    Duarte as the High Representative for Disarmament at the level of Under-Secretary-General.    The second term of the Brazilian President's administration coincided with more    incisive action on nuclear issues, as we will see later in the case of the Iran,    with the 2010 NPT Review Conference.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The goal of global    disarmament represented another point of agreement between Cardoso's and da    Silva's diplomatic action. Brazilian foreign policy was guided not only by Article    21 of the 1988 Brazilian Constitution, which bans any nuclear weapon from the    country, but above all by a demand from by the National Congress in 1998. At    the moment of the NPT ratification the Brazilian congress expressed to the government    a precise condition: the fulfillment of Article VI of the NPT that determines    the obligation for the nuclear states to dismantle their nuclear arsenals. Although    it could appear irrelevant to an understanding of the Brazilian foreign policy    over the last 12 years, the demand by Congress represents a point of convergence    between the different sides of the Brazilian political spectrum. If adhesion    to the NPT was a crucial question for the liberal elements in Brazilian politics,    the need to overcome the inequalities between Nuclear Weapon States (NWS) and    the Non-Nuclear Weapon States (NNWS) was the main matter of concern for a good    part of the nationalist and leftist wing of the Parliament<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent years    both administrations in Brazil have taken a critical attitude towards the failed    commitment of the United States of adhering to the CTBT (Comprehensive Test    Ban Treaty). Even though it was strongly supported by Washington during the    Clinton administration that signed it in 1996, the US Senate refused to ratify    it in 1999 because of the perceived weakness of the agreement for non-nuclear    proliferation after the 1998 Indo-Pakistani crisis. Brazilian disappointment,    throughout the George W. Bush administration, was caused by the resumption of    Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and the consequent lack of consensus    between the United States and the Russian Federation concerning the signing    of the START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) III for a substantial reduction    of nuclear arsenals.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If all the nuclear    powers were criticized for the paralysis in their commitment to NPT article    VI, a turning point can be considered, also from the Itamaraty perspective,    as being President Obama's 2009 speech in Prague. The new American President    demonstrated a substantial change of the US position in the nuclear field with    a three-part strategy: a) to propose measures to reduce and eventually eliminate    existing nuclear arsenals; b) to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty and    to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons to additional states; c) to prevent    non-nuclear states from acquiring nuclear weapons or materials<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">President Luiz    In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva and his Foreign Minister welcomed the new American    attitude, hoping for a positive development of this strategy. Although the Iranian    and North Korean cases increased US disillusion, and despite strong internal    opposition towards the full renunciation of the first nuclear strike capability    and of nuclear weapons in general, a concrete step toward the Prague objectives    was the signature of the new START in April 2010 between the two former superpowers.    This treaty, after the difficulties of the Clinton and Bush administrations,    marked the decisive resumption of the path towards the global nuclear disarmament<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a>.    The new course of US nuclear policy has been generally supported by the current    Brazilian administration. Notwithstanding some recent disagreements over the    Iranian nuclear program, that will be discussed later, a cordial and frank dialogue    has marked the US-Brazil relationship in the nuclear field.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 1996, however,    a controversial point has characterized Brazilian participation in the nuclear    non-proliferation regime. Although the 1994 Quadripartite Agreement imposes    a full range of safeguards concerning nuclear activities, Brazil refuses to    participate in an additional measure to the NPT, namely the IAEA Additional    Protocol to the Safeguards Agreement. The Additional Protocol is a legal document    granting the IAEA complementary inspection authority to that provided in underlying    safeguards agreements. One of its main aims is to enable the IAEA inspectorate    to provide assurance about both declared and possible undeclared activities.    Under the Protocol, the IAEA is granted expanded rights of access to information    and sites<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a>. Intense negotiations    for stricter safeguard measures took place between 1996 and 1998.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if the Brazilian    opposition began during the Cardoso presidency, it became a matter of international    concern during the years of Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva. A relevant part    of the international community, especially the United States, insisted on including    the Additional Protocol as a part of the NPT<a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14"><sup>14</sup></a>.    With an advanced nuclear program, the Brazilian position was deeply criticized    in 2004 after the inauguration of the enriching uranium plant in the nuclear    fuel factory of the INB (Brazilian Nuclear Industries) in Resende, in the state    of Rio de Janeiro. Between March and November 2004 negotiations took place between    the IAEA and Brazil about adjusting the international inspections to suit the    need of preserving national technology. Through an agreement with the IAEA the    Brazilian government agreed to protect the centrifuges from visual inspections    using panels, without prejudicing the verification of the nuclear material.    Notwithstanding this subsidiary agreement, the issue still remains central today    in the IAEA-Brazil relations, not only with regard to activities related to    the Resende plant, but also to the similar Navy plant in Aramar and the nuclear    reactor plant developing a submarine engine<a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides the IAEA    negotiations, the Brazilian refusal to adhere to the Additional Protocol was    a source of tensions between the Bush administration and the Brazilian government.    In June 2004 Brent Scowcroft, then chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence    Advisory Board, deeply Criticized The Brazilian Nuclear Program In An Article    In <i>The Washington Post</i><a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a>.    Comparing Brazil to Iran, in a period when the latter state had already ambitions    in the area of uranium enrichment, he wrote: "acquiescing in the Brazilian enrichment    program would have the effect of dividing nuclear power aspirants into good    guys and bad". In this context he did not see a legitimate ambition justified    by the NPT and guaranteed by IAEA inspections, but a threat for the whole nuclear    proliferation regime coming from an opponent to the Additional Protocol<a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a>.    The Scowcroft position was confirmed during the works of the Independent Panel    on a More Secure World and Strengthened United Nations, convoked in 2004 by    the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in order to strengthen the international    organization on its 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary. As reported by the Brazilian    delegate, Ambassador Baena Soares, Scowcroft proposed in the draft report of    the panel a moratorium on the construction of enrichment facilities because    of the risk connected to a possible proliferation of nuclear weapons. This proposal,    opposed by Baena Soares in a letter to Annan, directly involved the Brazilian    plant<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a>. Although a report    by the panel to the UN General Assembly was planned to be delivered in 2005,    the idea of moratorium was softened and all the negotiations about non-proliferation    failed after the unsuccessful 2005 NPT review<a name="top19"></a><a href="#back19"><sup>19</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Any doubt on the    part of the US government concerning the Brazilian position on the nuclear proliferation    agreement was made definitively clear in a bilateral meeting between Celso Amorim    and Secretary of State Colin Powell. In October 2004, during an official visit    to Brazil, Powell stated: "Brazil is not a potential proliferator.... In fact,    it reportedly has agreed to allow the UN atomic watchdog agency to see parts    of the centrifuges. Having renounced plans for nuclear weapons in 1990, Brazil    wants to keep its reputation as a peace advocate<a name="top20"></a><a href="#back20"><sup>20</sup></a>".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if an open    crisis between Brasilia and Washington was avoided on subject of the Additional    Protocol and its application to the Brazilian plants, the matter continued to    represent an important issue at the nuclear non-proliferation discussions. A    constant and growing number of signatories of this non-compulsory agreement    are giving more credibility to this agreement. In a recent interview Minister    Amorim, on the contrary, affirmed that the issue was not central to the reform    of the NPT and underlined the Brazilian right to preserve its industrial secrets.<a name="top21"></a><a href="#back21"><sup>21</sup></a>    In the future, however, it is possible that this position, which has remained    the same since the years of the Cardoso presidency, might be modified in the    face of stronger international pressure over the inclusion of the Additional    Protocol in the Non-Proliferation Treaty <a name="top22"></a><a href="#back22"><sup>22</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The central    role of Celso Amorim</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite all the    ideological differences and the different ideas that have emerged in the Brazilian    foreign policy, there is a central element that constantly marked Brazilian    diplomacy: the presence of Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's Foreign Minister    Celso Amorim. Amorim held this post between 1993 and 1995, during the Itamar    Franco administration, was Brazilian permanent representative at the United    Nations in New York in the Cardoso years, and played a central role in the whole    process of insertion of Brazil in the nuclear non-proliferation agreements.    It is worth recalling that he headed Itamaraty when the Tlatelolco treaty and    the Quadripartite Agreement were implemented and ratified. In 1995 he was an    observer of the quasi-universal consensus on the Non-Proliferation Treaty after    the review and extension conference that took place in New York that year. He    contributed to shaping Brazilian foreign policy in the form of renewing a strong    position in relation to denuclearization and disarmament.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The work he has    done from 1993 until 2010 can be compared to the Brazilian commitment to the    independent foreign policy of the years that preceded the military dictatorship.    This appears clear not only from the 1997 signature of the NPT, but above all    by the Brazilian participation in a coalition of middle-level and neutral powers    that, as in the 1960s, promoted the goal of full disarmament and denuclearization    or carried out the role of negotiators in the nuclear crisis, as was the case    of Brazil in Cuba in 1962<a name="top23"></a><a href="#back23"><sup>23</sup></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The clearest evidence    of this continuation and of the new course of the Brazilian policy may be identified    in the Amorim's participation in the Canberra Commission on the Elimination    of Nuclear Weapons. Established as an independent commission in November 1995    by the Australian Government, led by the then Prime Minister John Keating, its    report was issued in August 1996 and presented to the UNGA at the end of September.    The Canberra <i>Report,</i> after having highlighted the main points of the    nuclear debate, proposed the necessary steps to eliminate nuclear weapons<a name="top24"></a><a href="#back24"><sup>24</sup></a>.    The Canberra Commission was composed of key actors of both governmental and    non-governmental origin and became the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation    discussions of the following years. Hence all the requests for disarmament from    the middle-level powers relied on this report that, for the first time after    the end of the Cold War, represented a new position, overcoming the traditional    rivalry between the NWS and the NNWS. Former opponents to the Non-Proliferation    Treaty, such as South Africa and Brazil, neither their traditional attitude    in favour of proposing a new agenda. The importance of that experience, and    the need for accomplishing the still unfulfilled Canberra goals, was recalled    by Foreign Minister Amorim in February 2010 in Paris during the summit meeting    of the 'Global Zero' organization<a name="top25"></a><a href="#back25"><sup>25</sup></a>.    His action and, in general, the Brazilian attitude, continued to follow the    pro-disarmament spirit that Amorim had showed during his participation in the    UN meetings, in the Disarmament Commission, in the General Assembly, and above    all in the Security Council where Brazil has had a seat several times during    the last years.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most relevant    point to be considered was Amorim's action in promoting the success of the 2000    NPT Review Conference. Brazil, along with the other countries of the New Agenda    Coalition, had a central role in elaborating the 13 steps toward nuclear disarmament    that formed the core of the final declaration of the conference. Although the    Minister was a strong supporter of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, as were    many other key members of the da Silva administration, he did not change his    position concerning nuclear non-proliferation. In recent years he has insisted    on promoting Brazilian action in the NPT and in assuming an important role in    the negotiations concerning the current and future status of the non-proliferation    regime. Amorim has defended strenuously the Brazilian attitude in relation to    'soft power' for dealing with the recent crises in the international system.    Since the beginning of the da Silva administration he has succeeded in making    a synthesis between promoting the PT's traditional values in foreign policy,    search as the request for a fairer international and multilateral system, with    the position of the former government that was oriented toward full inclusion    in the Non Proliferation Treaty. He has consequently provided continuity, conciliating    the action of the two governments<a name="top26"></a><a href="#back26"><sup>26</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>New elements    of President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's diplomacy: mediation between    Teheran and the nuclear powers</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The continuing    presence of Amorim deeply influenced Brazilian foreign policy and allowed Brazil    to have a coherent attitude for many years. Nevertheless it is possible to find    many elements of discontinuity with the previous administration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During recent years    the Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's nuclear diplomacy has been dominated    by the attempt to play a central role in the negotiations between Teheran and    other nuclear powers, above all the United States and Russia, concerning the    Iranian nuclear program. The Government of Teheran, full member of the NPT,    in fact, is suspected of carrying out a clandestine military project for the    enrichment of uranium. Iran presents powerful reasons to justify its right to    enrich uranium, but the nuclear powers do not believe this rationale and consider    more likely the possibility that Iran is building nuclear weapons in order to    deter the threat coming from other countries in the area, particularly Israel.    It is important to remember that the belt of states from China to Israel is    almost completely equipped with nuclear weapons with the exception of Iran.    Security concerns could, consequently, give an explanation for a further proliferation    in the area for a state like Iran that is the object of threats from the United    States, Arab states, and above all Israel, whose secret service has been warning    the international community for more than ten years about possible nuclear devices    in Iran. The threat was, furthermore, perceived of an Iranian missile program    directed against the countries in the area and for uranium enrichment facilities    undeclared to the IAEA, that were announced only in September 2009<a name="top27"></a><a href="#back27"><sup>27</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On October 1<sup>st</sup>,    2009 however, the IAEA together with the so-called P5+1 (United States-China-France-United    Kingdom-Russia + Germany) reached a compromise with Iran over a possible swap    of uranium for low enriched uranium (at the rate of 3.5%) for medical uses.    Under the agreement, Iran would send about 1,200 kilograms of its Low Enriched    Uranium (LEU), 75% of the enriched uranium owned by Teheran, to Russia for further    enrichment. France would then turn that enriched uranium of Russian origin into    fuel for the Teheran Research Reactor. That reactor has been operating on Argentine    fuel since 1993 and it was expected to run out of fuel "in roughly the next    year, year and a half"<a name="top28"></a><a href="#back28"><sup>28</sup></a>.    The agreement reached "in principle" between Teheran and the P5+1 appeared a    necessary step for creating mutual trust for further negotiations, after the    announcement of the secret enrichment facility that isolated Iran also from    China and Russia.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After an initial    acceptance of the deal, Teheran refused to implement it due to the lack of the    necessary guarantees of the delivery of nuclear material and to the opposition    of the most conservative sectors of the Iranian regime. The beginning of the    Iranian procedure of uranium enrichment until 20% in February opened the path    to a new round of economic sanctions issued by the Security Council after a    US proposal<a name="top29"></a><a href="#back29"><sup>29</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The resolution    of the Iranian nuclear threat dominated the debate in the international community    during the whole period from December 2009, when US President Obama stated the    possibility of further negotiations with Iran by the end of the year, until    the decisions of the Security Council in June 2010.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil played a    central role in the whole negotiation of the final six months, coinciding with    its presence in the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the geographical    distance and the deep difference of the political regimes, bilateral relations    between Brazil and Iran have improved significantly over the years. With bilateral    trade of more than US$ 2 billion, the Iranian market has become important for    the growing Brazilian economy. Iran, another key-country in the emerging world,    fits in with President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's plan of developing    important relations with the main actors in 'the South'. The relationship with    Teheran is to be inserted in the South-South cooperation of Brazil with the    major countries of other continents as China, India, Russia, and South Africa<a name="top30"></a><a href="#back30"><sup>30</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Friendly relations    with the Islamic republic were confirmed by the important visit of the Iranian    President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to Brasilia in November 2009. During bilateral    meetings the Brazilian President renewed his support to the negotiations between    the parties and opposed the adoption of the sanctions by the UN Security Council    or the international community, even though he reaffirmed his full opposition    to an Iranian military nuclear project<a name="top31"></a><a href="#back31"><sup>31</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent years    Brazil has respected and defended Iran is right to enrich uranium for the peaceful    use of nuclear energy according to the concessions of the NPT. The position    Brazil has held was the same as it held concerning the Additional Protocol,    and could be considered similar to that of Iran. Pragmatically Brazil defended    the possibility for a Third World country acquiring a technology considered    important for its national economic development. The Brazilian President's defense    of this right appeared in line with traditional Brazilian support for the peaceful    use of the nuclear energy as an instrument for overcoming economic underdevelopment.    It is important to underline that more than thirty years ago both Brazil and    Iran, even if in different historical contexts and with different domestic regimes,    suffered analogue pressures from the international community to give up their    nuclear ambitions. Their solidarity can be consequently interpreted as the common    desire to have full access to this energy source. According to more recent declarations    Brazilian diplomacy, furthermore, has shown that it trusts the peaceful intentions    of the Iranian nuclear plans<a name="top32"></a><a href="#back32"><sup>32</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The different geographical    context, the democratic nature of the Brazilian government, and the absence    of security threats make the two cases deeply different, allowing Brazil not    to be perceived as a threat by the international community. Recent domestic    political problems, the contested election of June 2009 and Ahmadinejad's statements    against Israel have made the Islamic republic the object of even stronger international    suspicions. However Brazil has taken a favorable position toward Iran since    2006, receiving consequently domestic and international criticisms for its affinity    with a 'rogue' state where political and human rights are not respected.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last months    of 2009 after having supported the swap agreement of October, Brazil continued    to sustain the necessity of negotiating a solution to the diplomatic crisis<a name="top33"></a><a href="#back33"><sup>33</sup></a>.    The country's presence in the highest international forum, along with another    emerging non-nuclear country, Turkey, gave the two states the opportunity of    becoming the protagonists of the mediation between the nuclear powers and the    Iranian government.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The coincidence    with the 2010 NPT Review Conference and its preparatory work allowed Brazil    to discuss nuclear issues both bilaterally and multilaterally.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazilian-US relations    were central in the mediation. After the confirmation of the mutual commitment    to nuclear non-proliferation in the Amorim-Clinton meeting held in Brasilia    in March 2010, the two countries maintained radically different positions towards    Iran. If Brazil reiterated the Iranian right to enrich uranium for peaceful    uses, the United States proposed new sanctions towards Iran. The Washington    government and those of many other countries suspected that any prorogation    of the negotiation with Teheran was part of the Iranian strategy for gaining    time and enriching enough uranium to build an atomic weapon.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On April 13, 2010    during the Global Nuclear Security summit called in Washington by the United    States, President Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva and Turkish Prime Minister    Erdogan presented to President Obama a Turkish-Brazilian proposal for reviving    the failed deal between Teheran and the nuclear powers. Brazil sought to resolve    the diplomatic impasse by a preliminary visit of Foreign Minister Amorim to    Teheran at the beginning of April, and initiative that was approved by Iran.    Even if the United States welcomed the efforts toward the resumption of the    negotiations the policy maintained by Washington was to issue sanctions and    to begin new talks with Iran. Notwithstanding this situation President Luiz    In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva announced his attempt at negotiating the deal through    direct contacts with Ahmadinejad<a name="top34"></a><a href="#back34"><sup>34</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Washington two    positions clearly emerged. There was one side led by Brazil and other emerging    countries, which approved favoring negotiation with Iran, and there was another,    led by the United States and the rest of the official nuclear powers, that did    not trust Teheran's promises and proposed to impose economic sanctions through    the UN Security Council. The two positions appeared, consequently, irreconcilable.    In this context Amorim tried to obtain the Chinese and Indian endorsement for    the proposal during the BRIC meeting held in Brasilia. The Chinese President    Hu Jintao and the Indian Prime Minister Singh expressed their agreement with    the Brazilian position, thus strengthening the possible success of the negotiations<a name="top35"></a><a href="#back35"><sup>35</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A turning point    was reached on May 17, colleague some weeks after the beginning of the NPT review    conference. After a new series of visits to Teheran, Celso Amorim and his Turkish    homologue Davutoglu succeeded in achieving a formal declaration from the heads    of state of Turkey, Brazil, and Iran. As with the deal of October 2009, Iran    would allow the inspections of its nuclear plants as well the swap of the same    amount of 1200 kilograms of LEU to be transferred to Turkey. The Teheran declaration    had an impact on the international community because the governments of Ankara    and Brasilia seemed to have succeeded where the major powers had previously    failed<a name="top36"></a><a href="#back36"><sup>36</sup></a>. At the end of    the month Amorim and Davutoglu issued a public call for international support,    above all by the members of the Security Council, for the Teheran diplomatic    declaration<a name="top37"></a><a href="#back37"><sup>37</sup></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recent developments    of the Iranian nuclear issue do not make it clear whether the Brazilian-Turkish    effort was a diplomatic triumph. The United States and other nuclear powers    criticized the Brasilia-Ankara action and continued their tough policy towards    Iran. In mid-June 2010, in fact, the UN Security Council voted, with the opposition    of Brazil and Turkey and the Lebanese abstention, in favor of new sanctions    against Teheran.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides the fact    that it is not possible to assess its success, the Teheran declaration gave    a clear message to the international community: it showed Brazil moving closer    to the club of major powers. If Turkey, in fact, was moved by regional reasons,    Brazil played like a global actor. Notwithstanding many critics of the Luiz    In&aacute;cio da Silva's foreign policy, even his opponents had to recognize    that this action, although played in a theater far from the traditional one,    was a confirmation of the Brazil's increasing weight in the international system.    Although this action did not meet the favor of the permanent members of the    Security Council, Brazil, with the assumption of its global responsibilities,    confirmed his status as a full candidate for a permanent seat in the highest    UN institution.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Luiz In&aacute;cio    Lula da Silva's nuclear strategy and its international relevance</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last point    to be taken into consideration in assessing the foreign policy of an emerging    power in the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century is the implementation    of the historical goal of the national nuclear program that represented an important    aspect of the da Silva years.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even if the Cardoso    administration did not completely abandon the nuclear plans, ideological and    economic factors prevented the elaboration of a nuclear strategy that might    have been developed during the second government of Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula    da Silva.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important    to remember that the second Brazilian nuclear plant, Angra 2 in the state of    Rio de Janeiro came into operation in 2002, representing the first accomplishment    of the ambitious 1975 nuclear deal with West Germany<a name="top38"></a><a href="#back38"><sup>38</sup></a>.    During the years of Cardoso (1995-2002), and at the beginning of the first da    Silva Presidential term (2003-2006), the government and civil society expressed    many doubts about the completion of construction of a third nuclear plant, Angra    3, construction of which was suspended for financial and technical reasons although    the Brazilian State owned 60% of the material and equipment needed for its operation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Immediately after    the inauguration of the new administration, in January 2003, the new Minister    of Science and Technology, Roberto Amaral, announced one of the goals of the    new executive: revitalizing the Brazilian nuclear program in both industrial    uranium enrichment and in the activation of new plants. His words were guided    not only by traditional ambitions of becoming a civil nuclear power but also    by Brazil's energy needs. The blackout suffered in 2002 by the main Brazilian    cities, S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, demonstrated the low reliability    of the hydroelectric plants in periods of droughts. The new rise in oil prices    and global warming created an animated debate in Brazil and all around the world    about alternative and clean sources of energy. Interest in nuclear energy in    the first da Silva government caused the inauguration of the already mentioned    INB (Ind&uacute;strias Nucleares Brasileiras) uranium enrichment facility, based    on the autonomous technology developed in the last thirty years.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the accelerated    economic growth of the country in recent years, the second government of Luiz    In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva (2007-2010) drew up ambitious nuclear plans similar    to those of President Ernesto Geisel (1974-1979).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first point    of da Silva nuclear program is the civil and industrial use of low enriched    Brazilian uranium.

Besides having acquired national autonomy in the nuclear    fuel cycle, the main ambition of the government of Brasilia is to join the international    market of the nuclear suppliers. A member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)    since 1996 and with a prominent role in this organization, Brazil has gained    complete international credibility in relation to its nuclear activity<a name="top39"></a><a href="#back39"><sup>39</sup></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>

In the next twenty years the Brazilian government will    not only complete Angra 3 but will build new plants in the Northeast of the    country. In its civil aspects, consequently, the da Silva administration has    the ambition of becoming a future protagonist in the global nuclear industry.

The deal foresaw the export of the    French technology to Brazil in order to make the country completely autonomous    within twelve years (i.e. by 2020).

The progress of the efforts in non-proliferation    issues is a factor of important continuity in the foreign policy of the last    sixteen years. The passage from Cardoso to da Silva did not modify the position    of the country. As has been emphasized, Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva did    not implement a new policy in defending Brazilian nuclear technology but continued    along the path marked out by previous governments.

The traditional opposition towards the NPT was transformed    into an action to achieve the modification of an unequal international system    by working inside the regime. The da Silva Government, many of whose members    criticized the country's remaining in the NPT, worked towards the accomplishment    of the three pillars of the treaty: disarmament, non proliferation, denuclearization.    From the 2008 National Defense Strategy, it was in fact clear that the acceptance    of stricter rules from the treaty could derive only from the renunciation of    the nuclear arsenals by the nuclear powers<a name="top45"></a><a href="#back45"><sup>45</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One great difference    from the previous administration is seen in the strong cooperation with other    countries from the countries of the so-called 'South'. Brazil, as in other periods    of its diplomatic history, particularly the 1970s, played the role of negotiator    between the North and the South. Its participation in the summits of the major    powers, such as the G-20, in those of the emerging powers, such as the BRIC,    and its strong multilateral and bilateral activities with other developing countries,    make Brazil a central actor in the changing international system.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The joint Brazilian-Turkish    effort for the resolution of the international crisis concerning the Iranian    nuclear program showed the capability of Brazil, and of its President, of becoming    a credible conciliator thanks to the good relations with both the United States    and Iran. Successful or not in that action, the Brazilian diplomacy showed that    it was able to mediate in areas far from its traditional region.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's entrance into    the club of the nuclear civil states completed the picture of Brazil as a rising    power. The country is on the way to achieving two traditional goals: the national    industrial enrichment of uranium and the construction of a nuclear submarine.    Differently from the past, Brazil now has a democratic government with a nuclear    strategy compatible with its domestic, regional and international commitments    for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. In this case its role as an emerging    country, and an enlarging market, has allowed the country to build a strategic    partnership with a country in the 'North'. France, like Germany 30 years ago,    could help Brazil to join an elite club of the nuclear powers with advanced    industries on its territory and a fleet of nuclear submarines under its seas.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The open question    for Brazil is whether, with the characteristics of global negotiator and with    full dominion of the nuclear technology, its new role in the international system    will be recognized by means of permanent membership of the United Nations Security    Council.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Received August    16, 2010    <br>   Accepted November 18, 2010</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

The first was the unilateralism    promoted by the G.W. Bush administration that led a coalition of states to a    war against Iraq because of the supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction    by Saddam Hussein's regime. The second reason was the North Korean withdrawal    from the NPT in 2003 after having announced its status as a country with nuclear    weapons. It caused a three-year impasse in the negotiations in the Korean peninsula    and saw the end of the diplomatic efforts conducted by the governments of Pyongyang,    Seoul, Beijing, Washington, Tokyo and Moscow. The third factor was the Iranian    nuclear program that was suspected of developing the clandestine construction    of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the tension present in the Middle East did    not allow, in 2005 or in 2010, the achievement of the goal of establishing a    nuclear weapon free zone in the area.

<body><![CDATA[<br>   <a name="back10"></a><a href="#top10">10</a> The necessity of following the    Congressional demand was recently brought to mind by Foreign Minister Amorim.

After the agreement    between Russia and the United States, the negotiations will be opened up to    the rest of the states that own nuclear weapons for a broader agreement over    the effective dismantling of the nuclear arsenals. This action is to be implemented    along with the full admission of the unofficial nuclear states in the NPT after    their renunciation of their atomic devices.    <br>   <a name="back13"></a><a href="#top13">13</a> The need for more incisive inspections    emerged when the IAEA discovered that Iraq, a signatory to the NPT and with    a safeguard agreement with IAEA, had developed a clandestine nuclear program    between 1981 and 1991. The goal of the program, initiated after the Israeli    bombing of an Iraqi reactor in 1980, was to build atomic weapons. The revelations    about this project shocked the international agency since the research buildings    had been built near an official and declared research reactor.    <br>   <a name="back14"></a><a href="#top14">14</a> It is important to underline that    a growing number of States are ratifying the Additional Protocol. In 2003 Iran    signed the Additional Protocol but did not ratify it. See Flemes, Daniel &#91;2006&#93;.<i>"</i>Brazil's    Nuclear Policy From Technological Dependence to Civil Nuclear Power". Hamburg:    GIGA German Institute of Global and Area Studies. p. 7. Although the nuclear    powers are not obliged to adhere to full range of safeguards, one of the last    decisions of President G.W. Bush was to ratify the Additional Protocol on December    30, 2008. This decision may be considered a confidence-building measure by the    US government. See "The US ratifies the IAEA Additional Protocol", (January    6, 2009). Available at Arms Control. &#91;<u><a href="http://www.armscontrol.org/node/3489" target="_blank">http://www.armscontrol.org/node/3489</a></u>&#93;.    (Accessed on May 15, 2010). A total of 101 states have ratified additional protocols    and another 29 have signed them.

Nougayr&egrave;de, Natalie    (May 30, 2010), "Le programme nucl&eacute;aire du Br&eacute;sil suscite des    doutes". <i>Le Monde.    <br>   </i> <a name="back16"></a><a href="#top16">16</a> It is important to state that    the State Department did not oppose the Brazilian nuclear program. There was    a division within the former US administration. One faction constituted by the    non-proliferation specialists, who elaborated the G.W. Bush nuclear doctrine,    considered Brazil a threat to the nuclear agreement because the Latin American    country could represent a model for some 'proliferating' states such as Iran    or North Korea. As a matter of fact, immediately after the Brazilian announcement    of the inauguration of the Resende plant a State Department official called    on Brazil to implement all IAEA safeguards at its nuclear plants and to adopt    an additional protocol on non-proliferation. On the other side, the US position    was modified by the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere when    he told reporters: "We believe they (Brazil) are committed to meeting their    international obligations and this is a matter that is best handled by the IAEA    in a multilateral way. We do not want to make this a bilateral issue, because    quite frankly the US has confidence that Brazil is a responsible actor. See    US quite confident about Brazil's intentions over nuclear technology". <i>Agence    France Presse - English version.</i> Wednesday April 14, 2004.

It is interesting to notice the similarity    between the US strategy to 'freeze' the Brazilian nuclear program in the 1970s,    with the Carter administration, and under the G. W. Bush administration. In    both cases the United States had the aim of establishing an international 'bank'    for nuclear fuel under IAEA supervision limiting any national ambition of enriching    uranium.    <br>   <a name="back18"></a><a href="#top18">18</a> For the portuguese translation    of the letter sent to the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and to the IAEA    Director Mohammed El Baradei see Baena Soares, Jo&atilde;o Clemente (2005),    "Nossa responsabilidade comum", in <i>Pol&iacute;tica Externa</i>, Vol. 14,    N. 12, p. 52-54.    <br>   <a name="back19"></a><a href="#top19">19</a> United Nations.

In January the Tupi discovery    was followed by the announcement of the discovery of a second field, Jupiter,    estimated to be of a similar in size to Tupi. According to current Brazilian    Defense Minister Nelson Jobim, the discoveries increased the country's need    for a Brazilian nuclear-powered submarine to help discourage possible terrorist    attacks against the offshore oil platforms to be built there.    <br>   <a name="back44"></a><a href="#top44">44</a> See DALY, John K.C.(2008).

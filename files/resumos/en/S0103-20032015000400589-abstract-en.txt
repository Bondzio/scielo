Abstract: This paper examines the ways that the socioeconomic characteristics of family farmers influence the adoption process or construction of knowledge in Banco da Terra Settlement in Nova Xavantina, Mato Grosso State, Brazil. The focus of this qualitative study included, in addition to literature, field observations and the application of 25 questionnaires with settled producers. The results showed that 40% of surveyed farmers are between 41 and 50 years old and 24% are older than 60, most of them do not have the complete primary school (68%) and the gross monthly income level of 64% of households is up to two minimum wages per month. The main source of income presented was the partial renting; however, the resulting incomes from off-farm labor and from retirement/pensions are also important. Thus, it is concluded that these characteristics outlined serve as a warning to local extension, for promoting highly dependent - labor knowledge or more complex skills that present a high risk of rejection or failure. Thus, the most assertive way forward for the extension is from this economic reality to establish a dialogue with settled families.

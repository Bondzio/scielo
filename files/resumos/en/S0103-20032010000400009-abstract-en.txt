Mergers and acquisitions in Brazil had improved in the 90's, and the productive section of the sugarcane agroindustry was one of the highlights. Effects caused by these transactions in the market can be positive or negative for both companies directly involved and the society. The objective of this research is to analyze the market concentration of producing units, the agroindustry of sugarcane and the ethyl hydrous ethanol distributors in Brazil. We have used as methods the concentration rates C4, C8, C20, the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI), and researches in another studies, journals and newspapers. The productive units have been decreasing their concentration, caused mainly by the increased production scale of the small and medium companies, resulting, therefore, in still very distributive productive units. The agroindustry was also very distributive, in spite of the intense merger and acquisition process that happened among those companies over the last years. On the other hand, distributors of ethyl hydrous ethanol have improved their concentrations in the market. With all this, it can be said that the merger and acquisition process might step up among producing units and the agroindustry which process sugarcane in the domestic market.

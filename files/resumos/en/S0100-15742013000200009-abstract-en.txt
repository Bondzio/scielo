This article discusses the directions taken by the public policy of scholastic digital inclusion, based on the results of an investigation into the impact of and process employed by Project UCA-Total (One Computer Per Student), implemented in five municipalities over the period 2010-2011. Evaluation of the program's impact - conducted longitudinally - was carried out via a home survey, rolled out in two waves. The investigation of the program's process used a number of qualitative methodologies, such as focus groups, interviews, and trips to the field. This paper focuses on the results derived from the panels, revealing the project to be underperforming, with operating standards that vary considerably from site to site. The program's enormous potential has not yet been fully taken advantage of.

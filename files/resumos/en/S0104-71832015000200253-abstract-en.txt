AbstractThis text attempts to show, through various ethnographic situations, the learning process of a family practitioner in the specific context of the daily routine of a residency in family and community medicine. This requires a trajectory that will bring out the specific characteristics of this practice as a complement to the biomedical training residents get during their undergraduate course. My argument is based on two key concepts: Karin Knorr Cetina&#8217;s epistemic culture and Tim Ingold&#8217;s education of attention.

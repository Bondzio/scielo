The Marine Extractive Reserve of Corumbau is located in a region of rich biodiversity, in the south of Bahia, in Brazil. It was created on demand of the artisanal fishworkers in the area and as a means to promote sustainability of its fishing resources and local economy, besides protecting the area and imposing limits to the predatory industrial fishing. Through the Participative Appraisal with Gender Focus we have investigated how the work division takes place, as well as the use, access and control of resources and benefits, and also the conditions that limit women's participation and mobility. Inducing women participation in the Management Plan may contribute to the planning of social and environmental policies which take into account gender equity to guarantee conservation and sustainability.

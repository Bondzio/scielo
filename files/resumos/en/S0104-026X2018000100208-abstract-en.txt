Abstract: This research was aimed at the analysis of sterility / infertility in the second half of the Twentieth Century in Brazil, through a documentary analysis of the Revista Pais &amp; Filhos. The central themes debated were the narratives constructed by the magazine about the difficulty or impossibility of having a child. The interest was related to the articulation between the medical knowledge and the speeches presented in the Pais &amp; Filhos, when the subject of the infertility was approached. The reflections of Butler (2000; 2002), Braidotti (2001), Haraway, Kunzru and Tadeu (2000), among others, were used as theoretical bases. In general, one can observe that the magazine constructed narrative strategies that turned infertile women into sick people. Gestation and the exercise of motherhood were widely valued by the magazine.

Abstract: This paper aims to analyze comparatively the main factors involved in the coordination of the agro-industrial system of biodiesel (AIS of biodiesel) in Brazil and the European Union, from the perspective of the stakeholders of this system. For this, a questionnaire was developed and the comparison was done by factor analysis. The results showed that similar factors are related to taxation and international trade, labor unions and associations representing the biodiesel plants and diversification, acquisition of family farming/small producer and guaranteeing supply. The different factors are: (1) in Brazil: growth strategies, competitiveness of plants, differentiation of plants, incentives for biodiesel production, general policies on biofuels, biodiesel production technologies and specific national policies and (2) in the the European Union: differentiation in the production of biodiesel and support organizations. The results also showed the existence of a trade-off regarding to the technological advances on the AIS of biodiesel. If, on the one hand, the inclusion of family farmers and smallholders in the economy is one of the factors to be considered for the sustainability of the system, on the other hand, the development of this, seeking to resolve the conflict food versus biofuels, marginalizes these producers.

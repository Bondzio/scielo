Morse</b></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Evanescent Paradigms</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For a Latin Americanist who is getting    on in years the shifts of paradigm by which we construe our region of interest    have accelerated to a breathless pace. Yet academic solemnity is such that mounting    chaos is presented as linear advance toward more perfect knowledge. It is as    though university departments, guilty of drunken driving, were administering    their own sobriety tests.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Think of what we've been through. In    the 1940s and into the 1950s there was agreement in all the Americas, except    in cranky socialist or fascist corners, on some brand of liberal evolutionism.    It rested on sanguine assumptions about the generative forces of industrialization    and the stabilizing influence of a literate middle class having a stake in a    modern economic order. By the mid-5Os it appeared that international capitalism    was not wholly beneficent. One began to hear that it had sinister, imperialist    features and that to countervail them the client countries required centralized    planning and "structural" change to correct for cultural differences    and a built-in economic handicap. As the plot thickened, the horizons of the    early 60s clouded over. Secular determinisms came to the fore: entrenched elites    who were cooptative rather than self-renewing or circulatory; permanent disadvantage    in world markets; an international system that was predatory as well as asymmetrical;    internal colonialism that had persisted since the sixteenth century or perhaps,    in Mexico and Peru, the fourteenth. At this point the Cuban Revolution became    a fascinating example of (however one interprets it) charismatic extrication    or heterodoxy by external subsidy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the late 60s    and early 70s the worst fears were realized. Revolutionary impulses were stubbed    out. The military shed their disguise as modernizing technocrats and intervened    to erect a state apparatus that was, in the social-science euphemism, frankly    "exclusionary" with respect to popular strata. When the clips were    down the generals were not umpires but vampires. Because this calamity affected    countries with prestigious academic cadres, their "bureaucratic-authoritarian"    model, improvised overnight, became doctrine for the whole region save for the    shopworn but still bothersome case of Cuba, now left to specialized Cubanologists.    By the mid-70s it appeared that the soldiers had bitten off more than they could    chew, that popular suffering and indignation demanded redress, and that elites    were not sufficiently monolithic and deferential to pledge eternal allegiance    to regimes whose competence did not extend to economics. By now, what's more,    popular uprisings in small Caribbean nations were stealing the spotlight, laying    under question the diagnoses from privileged academic vantage points. Blue-ribbon    analysts promptly supplied fresh models for redemocratization in conference    papers, sometimes at the very moment when their bureaucratic-authoritarian treatises    were monumentalized as books.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Paradigm shifts    have clearly accelerated beyond the safety margin. For if the replacement frequency    has shrunk to quinquennial intervals, how can paradigms ever be substantiated?    Bear in mind that graduate students are the principal source of data for validating    theoretical flights of senior professors. But if dissertations take eight years    from conception to divulgation, they will forever be documenting threadbare    propositions. The planned obsolescence of capitalism triumphs in the academic    marketplace, and scholarship pours into a perpetual black hole.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Latin America    as a Civilization</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now it may be that experience outruns    our capacity to interpret it. But much depends on what we mean by experience.    If we mean the familiar dilemmas posed by sudden deficits or military confrontations,    then "policy" is ipso facto reactive and improvised. Outcomes depend    on the skill, and above all wisdom of those who devise it. If we mean a large    sea change in our spiritual condition, there may be the occasional Kierkegaard    or Nietzsche who will detect it, but we common mortals must live out the experience    before we can, generations later, make out their Delphic meanings. My concern    here lies between these extremes. I look for understandings that can set manageable    context for quotidian events without invoking spiritual absolutes.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My middle ground has Latin America for    its arena. Here the level of "policy" concern presents dramatic contrasts    among Brazil, Cuba, and Chile while the level of Nietzschean "spiritual"    concern tranquilly assimilates all of Latin America to the Rest of the West.    For the present argument we simply assume Latin America to be a civilization    unto itself with its own political culture. To identify this culture would clarify    the logics of political action in the region along with many conceptual confusions    of the past fifty (or two hundred) years. What's more, if there's a chance that    Latin America may soon represent a world and not simply a Third World condition,    there is added reason to think toward political discourse of more fixity and    universality. We do not seek, that is, to hone local definitions of state, person,    and society in Brazil or Mexico. We propose instead that Brazilians and Mexicans    drop the prepositional phrase from such terms, as Vitoria and Hobbes did.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This universalist    aspiration was dear to Latin American neo-Hegelians and phenomenologists of    the 1940s and early 50s. Leopoldo Zea and his Mexican colleagues sought in Mexican-ness    (<i>lo mexicano</i>)<i> </i>a concrete form of <i>lo humano, </i>valid for any    person in this situation: <i>"Always concrete awareness of a determined    reality. Yesterday awareness of European man, today of the (hemispheric) American,    in the future awareness of every man in whatever circumstance or situation."    </i>(MIRÓ QUESADA, 1974, p. 222.) The ecumenical impulse soon collided with    functionalist and Marxist orientations in the 1950s and 60s, when a new generation    of social scientists like Florestan Fernandes believed that <i>"sociologists    of underdeveloped and dependent regions should not compete with those from research    centers in the central nations. Whe should focus our efforts on systematic empirical    research into the fundamental problems of those regions (...); and as for formal    or systematic sociology, we should limit ourselves to consuming, wherever and    whenever necessary, the results of the work of those centers" </i>(FERNANDES,    1977, p. 195-6).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zea, at this stage of his career, spoke    from a generous, highly eclectic Heglian perspective and Fernandes from a less    generous but still eclectic Marxian one. They in effect resurrected a grand    confrontation from nineteenth-century Europe. If, however, Latin America is    a black sheep within the "Western" family of nations, a dispute cast    in such terms illumines only fitfully the implicit themes of its civilization.    I suspected something of the sort when, as part of my self-education in the    1950s, I speculated that a pre-Enlightenment Ibero-Catholic heritage may broadly    condition the Latin American political agenda. The academic establishment consigns    this <i>approach, </i>however, to a pigeonhole discreetly labeled <i>"the    distinct tradition" </i>(WIARDA, 1982). North American scholars shy away    from so-called historico-cultural explanations because they elude empirical    demonstration, while Latin Americans, although more hospitable to flights of    fancy, understandably chafe under what seems the "dead hand" of an    authoritarian and archaic political culture.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The muddle arises because polemics over    Latin America's relation to the Modern West are resolved by reference to intellectual    canons of the Modern West itself,.whereas the case requires a global perspective    that allows us to see Western "sciences" as culturally embedded. Louis    Dumont stretches our grasp when he lumps world civilizations into those of <b>Homo    Hierarchicus</b> and <b>Homo Aequalis</b> (DUMONT, 1977 and 1980)<a name="1not"></a><a href="#not1"><sup>1</sup></a>.    Like most globalizer he makes no reference, so far as I know, to Latin America.    I therefore venture to include it in the Hierarchicus category, for it fits    Dumont's broadest generalizations about civilizations that failed to share the    "revolutions of values" as it accelerated in seventeenth-century Europe.    Why the Ibero Atlantic world desisted I try to explain elsewhere. (MORSE, 1988)    But we can dispense with historical pedigrees if we are game to accept Latin    American civilization <i>tout court.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impediment to historical reconstruction    is that Latin America is not Japan, where a Dore or a Bellah elegantly traces    how Shinto, Confucian, and other traditions are woven into patterns favorable    to the industrial ethic. The successful outcome legitimates the traditions.    To elicit serious discussion of Latin America's neoscholastic legacy is more    ticklish. One is politely suspected of clerical or authoritarian sympathies.    Perhaps Liberation Theology will liberate academic minds along with disinherited    peasants. But meanwhile Leopoldo Zea's old complaint that Latin American ideologists    suffer historical myopia still holds.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Non-Western ingredients    of the Latin American heritage of course yield supplementary identifications    with Dumont's "hierarchical" civilizations. But when these como to    the fore as <i>indigenismo </i>and <i>négritude, </i>they are plucked from context    and inserted into alien Western categories of etnicity and identity. To trace    how the Amerindian and African presence is in fact interwoven with "creole"    culture strengthens our argument, as I will later suggest. But for the moment    let us dispense with regional history and eat what's on our plate.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Western    Revolution of Values</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dumont comes to his study of the , revolution    of values in the Christian Occident from a scholarly career devoted to the caste    society of India. He now turns the Indian "mirror" around to look    from a fresh angle at the mental furnishings of the West<a name="2not"></a><a href="#not2"><sup>2</sup></a>. India    he recognizes to be an extreme case and wholly different from China or ancient    Greece. He also acknowledges Western variations between, say, France and Germany    with respect to nationalism and individualism. His trick is to define the Western    <i>"revolution" </i>so as to yield a principle of discrimination    for the West and the Rest.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two antitheses that support Dumont's    taxonomy are hierarchy-egalitarianism and holism-individualism. Hierarchy and    holism characterize most of the societies the world has known. The modern West    is an aberrant case. Dumont freely admits that his constructs fall in the shadow    of Maine and Tunnies. His reinterpretation, however, differs in key respects.    First, he pluralizes both poles of the dichotomy. Second, he implies no developmental    sequence; the "modern" pole is a civilizational option, not an evolutionary    outcome. Third, he uses mirrors to interpret the "modern" pole in    terms of the "traditional" rather than vice versa, and he warmly invites    complementary versions of <b>Homo Aequalis</b> from hierarchical cultures other    than the South Asian. Finally, the <i>implications </i>he draws from the revolution    of values are not at all those of Maine, Tunnies, or even Durkheim; and since    implications concern us, we may borrow taxonomy as merely heuristic.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Briefly, Dumont    contrasts society seen as a whole <i>(universitas) </i>with society seen as    an association <i>(societas). </i>In one case the norm is <i>"order, tradition,    orientation of each particular human being to the ends prescribed for the society".    </i>Man here is a social being, deriving his humanity from society as a whole.    In the other emphasis falls on <i>"the attributes, claims or welfare of    each individual human being irrespective of his place in society"</i> The    <i>"individual" </i>exists by and for himself; society is at    best a partnership, at worst a burden or non-human fact (DUMONT, 1971, p. 32).    With the ascendancy of individualism the link between immovable wealth and power    over men is broken as movable wealth becomes more coveted. "Wealth"    attains autonomous status with the momentus consequence that relations between    men and things now overshadow those between men and men. This made it logical    for the English to abolish slavery in their colonies (long before the Spanish)    at the same time that they invited "free" workers to sell their labor,    and shorten their lives, in the coal mines.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The transition    from holism to individualism is marked in the ideological realm by the factoring    out of politics and economics from the complex: politics-economics-religion-society.    <i>"This separation of disciplines tended to hinder the mind from noticing    the faulty presuppositions of any particular discipline and to prevent it from    adverting to the lack of any coherent intellectual synthesis of the philosophical    and theological disciplines." </i>(MIDGLEY, 1983, p. 26.) Dumont follows    this development through five emblematic figures: Quesnay, Locke, Mandeville,    Adam Smith, and Marx<a name="3not"></a><a href="#not3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Here are some highlights. With Locke individualism,    authenticated by property, displaces the hierarchical ideal. Subordination recedes    as a social principle in favor of moral obligation. With Mandeville even morals,    insofar as they prescribe altruistic action, forfeit their claim on conduct.    Because private interests are deemed naturally harmonious, the public good is    to be realized through actions not consciously oriented toward it. Private vices    may be criminal, to be sure, but this becomes a matter of law, not morality.    Mandeville takes us from a post-hierarchical society, wherein persons internalize    social order in the form of moral rules, to an economic system wherein each    member defines his conduct by self-interest or hedonism, with society serving    as a mere harmonizing mechanism or invisible hand. Kant acknowledges the divorce    of norm from fact with his categorical imperative, while Bentham reduces morality    to utilitarian calculus. Meanwhile Adam Smith has anointed economics in its    acession as queen of the sciences. All this, by the early nineteenth century,    leaves the western fringe of Europe and the eastern fringe of North America    with a highly eccentric construction of social life.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marxism is the    apparent refutation of this revolution of values. If it failed to catch fire    in the Anglo Atlantic world and swept Western Europe in largely revisionist    form, it nonetheless became the lodestar of the Russian Revolution, and it continues    to bewitch the Third World. But why did Russians need to Russify and orientalize    Marxism? (BERDYAEV, 1960, p. 107). And why was Peru's Mariátegui impelled to    mythicize the Marxian message, infusing its scientism with the vitalist accents    of Sorel and Croce?<a name="4not"></a><a href="#not4"><sup>4</sup></a> The answer    lies in Dumont's exegesis of Marx's sociological texts that weighs their contradictions    against the premises to which he was ineluctably drawn. We cannot reproduce    the nuanced argument. To simplify, we summarize three conclusions. First, Marx    celebrates the triumph <i>of economism, </i>apotheosizing it from a privileged    discipline to a throne from which it cannibalizes sociology, history, and politics.    It has passed from the status of humble domestic to that of umbrageous rival    to that of abusive mother. Second, Marx ultimately espouses <i>individualism.    </i>Revolution is to emancipate man as an abstract, self-sufficient creature.    Although the <i>possessive individualism </i>of classical liberals is of course    pilloried, in a future society social man will yield to the release of individual    interest and capacity. Sociology recedes before the primacy that Marx accords    to the relation of man and nature over that between man and man. Third, Marx    boldly accepted to demythicize the foundations of social life. If his writing    drew forensic power from suppressed Promethean and Judeo-Christian eschatology,    he refused to follow British empiricists in their mythic assumptions about <i>"natural    man"</i> and <i>"social contracts"</i><a name="5not"></a><a href="#not5"><sup>5</sup></a>.    He claimed to have erected his argument on <i>scientific </i>bases, to have    unmasked social reality, and to have demonstrated that nothing is what it (ideologically)    seems. Economic theory is pressed to demonstrate what was hitherto an ethical    norm.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This interpretation, emphasizing Marx's    economism, individualism, and scientism, gives substance to Foucault's opinion    that Ricardo achieved a sharper <i>"epistemic break" </i>than Marx,    Marxism, he claims, introduced no real discontinuity at a deep level of knowledge.    It fell heir to a hospitable epistemology; it took to nineteenth-century thought    like a fish to water. Its conflict with <i>"bourgeois" </i>economics    implied not a schismatic recasting of history but mere angry coexistence (SHERIDAN,    1980, p. 70-1). If we accept for the moment that Latin American societies show    strong traces of holism, and even if we favor Dumont's judicious argument over    Foucault's flamboyant one, we can appreciate why Marxism took so long to strike    roots in Latin America, why Mariátegui performed such acrobatics to devise an    <i>indigenous </i>Marxism, and why, when neo-Marxisms took the region by storm    in the 1960s, the storm was transient even though, like any strong tempest,    it changed the mindscape.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What, then, had happened in Western    Europe? Economics (as queen) and politics (as hand-maiden) were extracted from    the holistic complex leaving religion and society, it appeared, impotent and    anecdotal. The pecking order that any community requires was no longer inferred    from religion or natural law but furnished by a calculus of naked power. Hierarchy,    now unthinkable, fades into bleak, statistically determined social    stratification. The new human sciences are ranged on a scale from hard to soft    that runs approximately: economics-political science-sociology-anthropology-history-philosophy-literature    and the <i>arts. Humanities, </i>or the study of things human, brings up the    rear. Geography, perhaps made obsolete by jet travel, instant communication,    and martial delivery systems, plays a spectral role. Psychology, depending on    its practice, falls anywhere along the scale. If it rips the veil from raw instinct    it can dethrone economics, and threatens to do so in both totalitarian and consumerist    societies; if it contents itself with the idle play of imagery it lapses back    into the humanities. Dumont is worth quoting at length:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"More generally, political theory    stubbornly persists in identifying itself with a theory of power, that is, mistaking    a minor problem for the basic one, which lies in the relation between power    and values, or ideology. The moment hierarchy is eliminated, subordination has    to be explained as the mechanical result of interaction between individuals,    and authority degrades itself into power, power into influence, and so on. It    is forgotten that this sort of question appears only on a definite ideological    basis, namely, individualism: political speculation has enclosed itself unawares    within the walls of modern ideology. Yet recent history has afforded us an imposing    demonstration of the vacuity of mere power </i><i> I mean the vain, if devastating,    attempt of the Nazis to base power on itself alone." </i>(DUMONT, 1977,    p. 10.)</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If one examines    the social-science course offerings, or impositions, of an elite North American    university, one quickly spots the bias toward power instead of context, toward    what is reductive, instrumental, and systemic instead of nuanced, relational,    and culturally responsive. A leading economics department may <i>offer </i>only    <i>one </i>one-quarter course on European economic history having the chronological    scope to disclose how the discipline itself won primacy in the revolution of    values and how a <i>cost-benefit </i>analysis of the feat might turn out. The    bulk of courses assume only benefits as they briskly demonstrate the nuts and    bolts of control and management through such topics and techniques as: accounting,    econometrics, commodity futures markets, money and banking, financial decisions,    science and techonology, development, population interactions, marketing, linear    programming, public finance, fiscal policy, agricultural policy, tax policy,    trade policy, human resources, business firms seen as a cooperative <i>"game",    </i>economics of medical care, mass media, power and conflict in social systems    (treated as game theory), price and allocation, monetary theory, labor economics,    energy modeling, equilibrium analysis, and, to cover all bases, the <i>"economics    of uncertainty'' </i>(STANFORD, 1983, p. 339-58).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How would we translate this menu for    a Mexican or Brazilian peasant? Clearly the curriculum magnetizes its apprentices    toward careers as programmers and manipulators. It crowds out consideration    of Lockean <i>"morality", </i>not to mention pre-Lockean holism. Not    a single course title includes even the word <i>"democracy".</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much the same can be expected of offerings    in political science, with the term <i>"policy" </i>again coming to    the fore (Ibid., p. 507-18). Students receive few hints that what are passed    off as diagnostic tools are flying buttresses for an ideological cathedral.    Mastering the secrets of sheer power presupposes severe contraction of the field    of vision and, accordingly, proliferation of more courses. The more that proteges    specialize in the arcana of control, the sharper their alienation from the human    condition. The fate of Dickens' perplexed proletarian Stephen Blackpool in <b>Hard    Times</b> (1854), for whom economics was <i>"aw a muddle", </i>has    gradually become that of society at large:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Deed we are in a muddle, sir    (...). Look how we live, an' wheer we live, an' in what numbers, an' by what    chances, and wi' what sameness; and look how the mills is awlus agoin', and    how they never works us no nigher to onny dis 'ant object </i><i> 'ceptin awlus    Death."</i></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Question    of Ideology</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this point we    grope for clues to the nature of <i>ideology</i>; for if we assume that Lockean    or Marxian versions thereof answer the special needs of <b>Homo Aequalis</b>,    it stands to reason that the term requires overhaul if it is to mark boundaries    for common discourse between the West and the Rest. In the last century ideology    was renovated from conflict and compromise between elites and <i>dangerous classes    </i>within the bosom of the West. This dialogue echoed throughout the world    but could not easily take root, for it made eccentric assumptions about state    and society that were coming to be shared by modernizing elites, political economists,    and factory hands of the industrializing countries. Elsewhere I address this    issue of ideological translatability by analyzing why we associate a <i>"school    of economics'' </i>with industrial Manchester of the last century and a <i>"school    of sociology" </i>with industrial São Paulo of our own (MORSE, 1978, p.    7-34). In the first case, consensual recognition of a national community supported    <i>scientific </i>diagnosis and therapy. In the second, the very existence of    a national community was questionable; diagnosis would require a sociologically    recognizable patient.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ea/v2n2/2a05f1.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In what follows I apply the term <i>ideology    </i>to the beliefs and moral sentiments of a community having a shared history    and not to an instrumental set of precepts and policy norms that disguise partisan    interests. A hegemonic ideology may be said to be the second type successfully    masquerading as the first. Those who disparage ideology often do so by pitting    it against philosophy or science. Midgley warns of a gulf between the thinker    in search of fundamental truth and the one who chooses or imposes <i>"values"    </i>irrespective of their truth or falsity. The inadvertence of ideology to    philosophic truth he attributes to the <i>"intellectual amnesia" </i>of    the post-Renaissance and Reformation era. Abandonment of the medieval philosophic    synthesis in favor of modernist and atheistic presuppositions, he holds, has    produced ideological bondage in the moral, intellectual, and spiritual domain    from which the only deliverance lies in <i>"rejection of the entire ideological    enterprise as such" </i>(MIDGLEY, 1983, p. 159).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the neo-Marxist committed to science,    ideology poses a more complex if less overwhelming challenge. He must acknowledge    three versions of ideology: first, a set of beliefs that justify the interests    of a group or class; second, a set of illusory beliefs, or <i>"false consciousness",    </i>and third, <i>"the general process of the production of meanings and    ideas"</i>. The third and more neutral version, necessary of course for    validating <i>"socialist ideology"</i>, undercuts the first two (WILLIAMS,    1977, p. 55-71). The addition <i>oí hegemony </i>to neo-Marxist vocabulary provided    a kind of<i> false synthesis </i>by associating ideology with the production    of ideas while suggesting that class interest and false consciousness might    become hypostasized as a civilizational commitment. The latter occurs when the    citizen's compliance is experienced as participation under systems wherein counterideologies    and interpellations are <i>democratically </i>yetted and then run off to ground     thus permitting, for example, a <i>silent majority </i>to imagine itself to    be a prepotent plutocracy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After I had composed a draft of these    thoughts I learned of Luis Villoro's book on <i>the concept of ideology </i>(VILLORO,    1985). I awaited it with certain trepidation, for I knew that this accomplished    Mexican philosopher, with his analytic skills and sensitivity to historical    process, might make my own reflections superfluous. If, having now read his    adroit and lucid book, I find this to be only partly so, it is also clear that    his argument is a necessary antecedent and accompaniment to mine. Villoro patiently    defines the slippery terms <i>statement, attitude, belief, </i>and <i>ideology.    </i>Applying both gnosiological and sociological analysis, he retraces the treatment    of ideology by Marx &amp; Co. and mourns the paradoxical ideologization of Marxism    itself. Thinkers who unmasked ideology so as to foster rationality and liberation    only codified, he finds, a new instrument of domination. <i>"Between science    and ideology", </i>Villoro asks, <i>"is space left for philosophy?".</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am in admiring accord with Villoro's    mission to demystify received clusters of philosophic thought and their subservience    to vested interest. I applaud his distinction between the searching propositions    of philosophy that liberates and philosophic    codification that obscures and dominates. I agree, as Marx in enlightened moments    insisted, that disruptive or liberating thought is impotent if unlinked to social    transformation. What I resist accepting is the lugubrious procession that Villoro    stages from philosophic speculation to codified doctrine to political manipulation    to ideological control. <i>"Unauthentic culture", </i>he concludes,    <i>"is ideological culture".</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As I see it, the    accent of my argument differs on two counts. First, I want to rescue ideology,    science, and philosophy from each other without severing them. The term <i>"ideology"</i>    proposed by Destutt de Tracy in 1801, is less venerable than philosophy and    science. Its ultimate meaning, however, underlies theirs since it has to do    with cultural premises for belief and praxis. <i>Ideology </i>is a neologism    that implies the commodification of moral sentiments in our industrial age just    as <i>entertainment </i>implies commodification of the arts, even though art,    as such, still endures. (Were there no precedent for my neutral use <i>of ideology,    </i>I might have echoed Adam Smith and called this chapter <i>"Notes toward    a Theory of Moral Sentiments".) </i>Villoro assumes that codified philosophy    is doctrinal, an arsenal of muskets and not a cupboard of passkeys. He smoothly    demonstrates (or alleges) that <i>"democracy", "Mexican Revolution",    </i>and <i>"socialism" </i>are in the service, respectively, of capitalism,    dependent underdevelopment, and Soviet bureaucracy, that they became ideologies    of domination and not, as initially promised, levers for libertation. For me,    philosophy and ideology may overlap or interfuse but are not sequential phases.    In my usage they have different origins, legitimations, and constituencies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our second difference,    then, is that Villoro treats ideology as an artifact or artifice of intellectuals    and publicists that should pass through the needle's eye of logic and evidence.    I on the other hand accept ideology as a societal product or historical emanation    where, given its diverse sources, the challenge is not validation but interpretation.    At the outset Villoro criticizes Mannheim's capacious and "vague"    treatment of ideology as <i>panideologism </i>that collapses into the sociology    of knowledge, whereas I take Mannheim as a transitional prophet between Marx's    era and our own for whom analytic energies were yielding to historical empathy    that was, at the time he wrote, necessarily more <i>vague </i>than Marxism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mannheim reexamined the question of    ideology between the World Wars. Rejecting a Eurocentric viewpoint and avoiding    distractive analogies with philosophy and science, he set out a series of illuminating    clues on how to reconceive ideology for a pluralistic world (MANNHEIM, 1929).    The anthropologist Geertz cautions against a supposed <i>Mannheim's Paradox    </i> to wit, that in striving toward a <i>"nonevaluative concept    of ideology"</i> Mannheim resorted to normative postulates and thence to    <i>"an ethical and epistemological relativism" </i>he found uncomfortable    (GEERTZ, 1973, p. 193-233)<a name="6not"></a><a href="#not6"><sup>6</sup></a>. Geertz himself, from his ahistorical,    functionalist position, sees ideology and science as serving culture in two    neatly complementary roles, ideology as its apologetic dimension and science    as its diagnostic one. He consigns ideology to a justificatory, rhetorical function    and science to an executive one that connects to <i>"reality". </i>My    own view, more consonant with Mannheim's, is that ideology has its own executive    force when it comes to <i>human "reality"</i>. Science can in fact    be considered to <i>depend on </i>ideology for its imagery and its agenda (although    once ideology canonizes science, it risks converting it to scientism).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dumont, whom I    think of as Mannheim's more self-assured sucessor, is categorical on this point.    He refuses to demote ideology form the company of science, philosophy, and other    <i>"reputable" </i>domains: <i>"there is already too much of    a dovecote here". </i>He locates the dilemma in the primal segregation    of politics and economics from religion and society. For him ideology is not    a residual category that absorbs left-overs from scientific and rational thought.    It is not a mask or opiate, nor is it, even in the classic sense of the adjective,    the rhetorical mobilization of Geertz. It delves to tacit premises, to the <i>"grid    of consciousness", </i>to <i>"implicit coordinates of common thought".    </i>Rationality and science clarify linkages between means and ends but cannot    hierarchize the ends. Even in a <i>scientific </i>society science is not a referee    but a team player in the ideological world series who breaks his collarbone    like anyone else. Scarcely any modern citizen can demonstrate the heliocentric    theory and none is even aware of it when watching a <i>sunset. </i>Neoscholastic    Spaniards were quite candid; they fended off the Toledo blade of science simply    by calling heliocentrism a fiction useful for maritime navigation. In our own    day we expect the most progressive teachers and students to boo a Nobel laureate    off the stage if he dares adduce <i>"hard" </i>somatic evidence for    racial inequality. In the industrial West society and religion (belief) wait    patiently on the sidelines, hoping for interstitial entry into what Chauí calls    the <i>"lacunar" </i>or self-censored discourse of formal ideology    (CHAUÍ, 1982, p. 3-13). During the Viet Nam War they waited well nigh interminably    for the <i>policy </i>resolution of scientism (domino theory), individualism    (massacre of innocents), and economism (tax burden and inflation). As we now    see, Viet Nam imparted no moral lesson to the perpetrators.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mannheim readdressed where Marx had    left it the discontinuity between ideology as self-interest or false consciousness    and as a process of rendering meanings. The former version had appeared with    individualization and rationalization. The eighteenth-century businessman or    intellectual required grounds for rational decision and freedom to think through    issues affecting his private interests.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was not the case for peasants or    subordinate white-collar workers who had little bent for initiative or speculative    foresight. As the religious world view disintegrated, although without vanishing, the absolute state asserted its political    conception of the world as a weapon, based now on science rather than on articles    of faith. With democratization, the task of fashioning a credo was relegated    to liberals, then to conservatives, finally to socialists. All brands of politics    took a scientific tinge while scientific attitudes assumed political coloration.    Unlike academic discussion, political debate is not resolved on theoretical    grounds. It strains to lay bare the motives of opponents, irrespective of the    theoretical plausibility of their positions. Politicians aim to talk past each    other, thinkers to engage.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mannheim's<i> Paradox </i>is not then,    as Geertz would have it, the stand-off between science and subjectivism  for    the two are interfused  but a tension between the particular and the general    which, as we will later see, were the terms that Rousseau had used at his own    critical moment. Every moment in modern times is of course <i>critical. </i>The    minds that interest us are those that experience theirs as so being. Mannheim    first published <b>Ideology and Utopia</b> in 1929, a critical year to be sure;    yet he found his <i>"era of transition" </i>laden with <i>"antiquated    traditions and forms". </i>He had to revert to Hegel's acceptance of the    Kantian dissolution of the world existing independently of mind and to the assumption    that the world's unity requires a knowing subject. Mannheim, that is, shouldered    the burden of German historicism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mannheim's pathology of nineteenth-century    Europe subtended a world arena. He was troubled by the transition from historical    <i>consciousness as such </i>to <i>Volksgeist </i>(still "too inconclusive")    to the doctrine of class idelogy. If this search was for the center of an infinitely    variable world, it must fight shy of mechanistic synthesis. The fictional unity    of <i>"consciousness as such" </i>must accommodate the outlooks of    epochs, nations, and classes. Here Mannheim moved toward a global calculus once    he had defined <i>"particular" </i>ideologies as a disguise for real    situations and <i>"total" </i>ideologies as historic thought-systems    grounded in noological coordinates. The latter contained yard-sticks to expose    the deceits of the former. Mannheim saw    around him a world in upheaval where beliefs and attitudes and even their intellectual    foundations were under question. He commended Marxist theory for having fused    particular and total ideology, using class and economic analysis to probe past    a <i>"psychological" </i>to the philosophic level. Yet even this stage    had passed, for socialists had lost their exclusive franchise for decoding bourgeois    thought. Others could turn the new weaponry against Marxism itself. Weber, Sombart,    and Troeltsch had pioneered the more agile strategy, and Mannheim quotes Weber's    dictum that the materialist view of history is not a cab that one enters or    alights from at will.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reconciling particular and total ideology    led Mannheim to posit a new phase, namely, the transition form the theory of    ideology to the sociology of knowledge. Here the observer relaxes his grasp    on absolutes in an era of <i>"intellectual twilight" </i>and recognizes    that the meanings of our world are historically determined and continuously    developing. In discarding fixed ideological <i>values, </i>a term redolent of    the capitalist commodities market, we enter a realm of uncertainty that is closer    to reality than were the absolutes of earlier faiths. As in the exact sciences,    the uncertainty principle offers firmer anchorage than does <i>certainty. </i>The    absolute, once a means of communing with the divine, now camouflages meanings    of the present. We can read history only through patterns rising from flux Hence    the anachronism of fixed <i>values. </i>The content of thought matters less    than its categorical structure. A modern theory of knowledge entails not surrender    to anarchic subjectivism, or <i>relativism</i>, but a search for historical    understanding that is <i>relational </i>among spheres of thought, given that    absolutes do not exist beyond incommensurable human contexts<a name="7not"></a><a href="#not7"><sup>7</sup></a>. The    danger <i>of false consciousness </i>is no longer that it fails to grasp a given    state of affairs but that it lacks dialectical attunement to the ceaseless reordering of mental processes    which compose our worlds.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While Mannheim derived his viewpoint    from history, he was aware that in his <i>"world of upheaval" </i>it    applied to contemporary cultures not less than to past epochs of his own tradition.    From this threshold between Eurocentrism and pluricentrism he offered many clues,    often allusive to be sure, for the challenge of ideological renewal in contemporary    Latin America.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two classic studies    of race relations in the United States and Brazil help to exemplify ideological    issues thus far raised (HEATH, 1974, p. 490-1/DA MATTA, 1979, p. 176)<a name="8not"></a><a href="#not8"><sup>8</sup></a>.    When Gunnar Myrdal and his associates presented their studies on the <i>dilemma    </i>of blacks in the United States, they introduced the central volume with    a statement of the <i>American Creed </i>against which treatment of blacks might    be measured (MYRDAL, 1944, chap.l). This Creed, they found, had sources in,    first, the ideology of the Protestant sects which envisaged democracy in prepolitical,    ecclesiastical terms; second, the tradition of English law that laid bases for    liberty, equality, and a government of laws rather than of men; and third, the    humanistic liberalism of the Enlightenment and its principles of the dignity    and perfectibility of man, a shared common weal, respect for consent of the    governed, and a notion of liberty that was aggressively if loosely defined and    assumed to derive form equality. This was perhaps the most explicit set of social    ideals of any Western nation and the one most widely understood and appreciated    by its citizenry. So compelling were its tenets that even blacks were <i>"under    the spell of the great national suggestion. With one part of themselves they    actually believe, as do the whites, that the Creed is ruling America".    </i>One could scarcely find a clearer instance of ideological hegemony, or conditioned    acquiescence in the precepts of a legitimized political order. Myrdal's challenge    was to explain racial discrimination, both legal and behavioral, given the <i>spell    </i>of the American Creed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1950s another European, Roger    Bastide, directed a set of comparable studies on race relations in Brazil (BASTIDE    e FERNANDES, 1955)<a name="9not"></a><a href="#not9"><sup>9</sup></a>. In this case no attempt was made to summarize    a <i>"Brazilian Creed" </i>as a yardstick for social behavior. This    could have been for several reasons. Perhaps in Brazil discrimination against    blacks was not at a quantum jump from that against other disinherited groups.    Or perhaps the researchers were being <i>"realistic" in </i>discounting    formal ideology. Or perhaps they simply assumed the norms of a generalized Western    ethic (the study had UNESCO sponsorship). Or perhaps, and <i>this </i>is what    my argument supposes, there is no Brazilian Creed in the unitary sense of Myrdal.    In the United States the imputation that a person or group is <i>un-American    </i>carries a clear set of meanings, while in Brazil the term <i>un-Brazilian    </i>would be something of a puzzle. If the term were coined, one might imagine    it signifying <i>"patriotic" </i>respect for an authoritarian public    order or else <i>"patriotic" </i>disrespect for that order; it might    be applied to those who undermine legal norms of equality or to those who <i>fail</i>    to exhibit the Brazilian kanck, <i>or jeito, </i>or circumventing formal codes.    In short, the norm for being <i>Brazilian </i>might be derived from an exogenous    constitutional criterion or from an endogenous cultural one.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazilian society, Da Matta has said,    is one of multiple ethics. Here the liberal, individualist Western ethic is    an official creed of legal equality that has no popular recognition as a prevalent    or enforceable ideal. Private codes at all social levels and informal cult groups,    sodalities, and festivals offer alternative constructions of society, methods    of coping, assurances of community, and therapeutic release. Here then, an oppressive    institutional order whitewashed by individualist, egalitarian ideology is complemented    by a family of subcommunities aspiring to an egalitarianism that is personalist    rather than individualist and therefore consistent    with holism. The realm of popular religiosity, in particular, represents <i>"a    subsidiary system that is gradualist, hierarchical, and compensatory: a system    possessing an enormous and clear multiplicity of spheres, motivations, and ideologies"    </i>(DA MATTA, 1981, p. 245). Such a society classifies the single person relationally    in the shifting context of his affiliations rather than atomistically by precepts    of a common <i>Creed. </i>In the American case the Creed and the culture are    seen as conjoined; Brazilians see them as unyoked.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How and when might <i>ideology </i>take    form in a society which is, in a radical sense, more pluralist than a Western    industrial democracy? Must it await a moment favorable for technocrats and charismatic    leaders to devise a self-legitimizing regime? Does it require explosive and    consensual redifinition of the rules of the game? Or is the society to fluctuate    indefinitely, as Da Matta suggests, between quiescent periods when a logic of    social complementarity allows a vision of the totality and episodes of crisis    when this logic collapses and the cosmic leader is called in?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addressing such    questions, let us brashly assume that the time is ripe to start articulating    ideology <i>not for </i>but <i>in </i>Latin America. It is not to be cut from    whole cloth, nor cater to vested interests, nor preempt an arc on the left-to-right    spectrum, nor address immediate policy matters. It will reflect inexpugnable    historical contradictions whence it issues and the contemporary world that it    faces. It will hierarchize aspirations in conformance to demonstrable circumstance    and shared belief. We are not talking of totalitarianism, a ludicrous pretension    to holism in egalitarian societies that corrupts science and manipulates history.    (Cf. Thomas Mann's <b>Mario the Magician</b>). Nor do we mean populism (promises,    promises, promises...). We commence, as ideological reconstruction must, with    commonsensical renewal of lexicon. From the domain of society-and-religion (or    experience-belief or anthropology-philosophy or history-literature) we fumigate,    item by item, the whole mystificatory terminology perpetrated by economics and    political science: state, society, bureaucracy, class, interest group, hegemony,    power, control, influence, management, decision-making, policy, plans, programs,    resources, organization, allocation, distribution, development, theory, models,    education, consensus, science, evidence, system, equilibrium, causality, rationality,    and many more. Communities are not machines, and privileged actors'are not omnipotent    nor even very competent engineers. To conceive of societies as systems of power    that is rationally exercisable without cultural or moral constraint produces    a world of confrontation, terrorism, bulging penitentiaries, and <i>defense    </i>budgets of a quarter of a trillion dollars. When <i>expertise </i>governs,    violence is the last resort, or alas, sometimes the first. Machiavelli was right    to warn of the hand of fortune in human affairs and Rousseau to insist on the    therapeutic force of a (perhaps inconstant) general will. As was Foucault to    invoke an <i>"insurrection" </i>of minor historical knowledges <i>"against    the institutions and against effects of the knowledge and power that invest    scientific discourses" </i>(FOUCAULT, 1980, p, 87).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>A Promising    Conjuncture</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before surveying    some possible contours of fresh ideology, let me show why this is a juncture    for doing so. There are three considerations. First, the domestic situation.    Ever since 1760, when a cautious meshing of ancient understandings to Enlightenment    discourse began occurring in Latin America, large fissures have appeared in    national platforms for ideological renewal. A horizontal fissure opens between    the cosmopolitan discourse of cities that envisions a systemic construction    of society and an accommodative, architectonic political culture that prevails    at grass roots and in the psychology of every-day life. Vertical fissures open    among groups of ideological innovators because for many reasons no <i>system    </i>seems to fit an architectonic society. Hence the characteristically <i>politicist    </i>form of Latin American political culture, where manifestoes, plans, pronunciamientos,    <i>and garantías </i>rally support for charismatic leadership and, as an afterthought,    append standard promises of<i> social reform </i>across the political spectrum.    The Mexican Revolution is a familiar case. It was not that revolutionary messages    were improvised and compromised, as happens in any upheaval, but that there    were no common understandings with respect to an elemental vocabulary and grammar    for ideology (FROST, 1972, p. 143-95). These, as will later appear, are still    lacking in Mexico.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ea/v2n2/2a05f2.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two centuries of random crises and arbitrary    regimes never precluded meliorist hopes pinned to evolution, enlightenment,    development, or simply a lucky cast of the revolutionary dice. Today, however,    the future seems menacing and turbulent, at worst apocalyptic and at best inscrutable.    Hence, the frenzied acceleration of paradigm shifts reviewed at the outset:    kaleidoscopic nightmares of the academic mind that too often become waking dreams,    as in Chile since the 1950s. Intellect becomes a loose cannon on the deck. It    has gained mass and critical capacity. It is no longer a patronized establishment    content to offer muted or encoded messages in lieu of sketching bold alternatives.    Conversely, those who wield political power, often less competent than their    predecessors, are losing authority to pacify intellect. The new universities,    conceived for cooptation and technocratic recruitment, are a Frankenstein's    monster. They command generous resources for reimagining the polity and for    reconceiving history to yield a usable past.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet the new intellectual    cadres cannot aspire to <i>impose </i>ideology as the <i>pensadores </i>once    did. We no longer require armchair conjectures about <i>natural men </i>and    <i>social contracts. People </i>are now <i>part </i>of society, despite sadistic    protestations by social pathologists that they are, by computerized indices,    at its margin. Glued to transistor radios, the people know what's at stake.    They are in quotidian, dialectical confrontation with authority. They discover    that their improvised sodalities for accommodation and solace harbor assertive,    renovative force. If life is an opera, which the Brazilian writer Machado de    Assis suggested it to be in chapter nine of <b>Dom Casmurro</b>, they are no    longer supernumeraries but sing their own arias, now audible over the familiar    score from the orchestra pit. (Note that Machado's God composed the libretto,    Satan the music. <i>"Indeed in some places the words go to the right and    the music to the left. (...). There are obscure passages; the maestro makes    too much use of the choral masses, which often drown out the words with their    confused harmony."</i>)</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second conjunctural factor has to    do with dilemmas of the industrial world. The metropolotian countries, alleged    to control Latin American destinies, are internally threatened by economic uncertainty    and exhaustion of cultural possibilities. Their life, hyperrationalized and    disenchanted, spouts symptoms of paranoia and blind adventurism. Their ideological    arsenal fails to yield an articulated polycentric scheme of the world. If such    is the plight of <i>hegemonic </i>powers, Latin America is no longer an ideological    consumer but has messages for the world. It requires its own ideological delivery    system.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That the old sureties    are crumbling and the future is murky makes the moment ripe for an ambitious    ideological project. If one gets static on the TV tube, one extends the antenna    for distant stations. The transmitters we might pick up are the great European    ideologists who wrote at a time when ancient verities were in collapse, new    bases for conceiving society were imperative, and to promulgate a viable future    was an act of sheer intellectual fortitude. Yet we are not simply to select    a new configuration of <i>influences </i>from <i>great minds </i>of the past.    Rather, we must attempt imaginative reenactment of situations in which such    minds  Vitoria, Hobbes, Rousseau (to whom we shall return), Hegel, <i>et al.    </i> were thrown back on epistemological and axiological foundations to reconceive    the <i>polis. </i>We quest not for propositions and formulae but for Aristotle's    <i>imitation of action. </i>How does one revisualize society at an existential    moment? The grand ideologists did so by looking to ancient and medieval exemplars    and by cultivating an intuitive, anthropological sense of immediate circumstance.    The <i>ancients </i>whom we look to are those very Europeans who attended the    birth of the Western nations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A third conjunctural    factor deserves lengthier consideration. One does not invent ideology <i>ex    nihilo. </i>Besides tuning in distant stations and having rapport with immediate    social circumstance, one must join a domestic conversation that has been framing    the issues. An Englishman in 1650 or a German in 1800 did not reach out blindly    to yoke Aristotle, Plato, Aquinas, and Machiavelli. He was immersed in contemporary    dialogue. In Latin America such dialogue was desultory for a century after independence    and often collapsed into soliloquies. Different explanations exist. Leopoldo    Zea has claimed that New World <i>"pensadores" </i>were victims of    <i>futurism </i>and failed to acknowledge and assimilate their own history.    A Gramscian might propose that the artificiality and social fragmentation of    the new nations precluded <i>hegemonic </i>ideologies. Florestan Fernandes contrasts    the original bourgeoisie that created its own world with the <i>"peripheral"    </i>one that accepts that world submissively and by diffusion. Dumont might    contend that Latin America, if one accepts it as one of the world's large family    of holistic societies, could never digest the individualist ideologies of industrial    Europe that had become its principal diet. Whatever one's mix of explanations,    one may plausibly suppose that the period was a <i>lost century </i>for ideological    reconstruction when one compares outcomes in such divergent cases as Russia    and Japan.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 1920s Latin American artists    and intellectuals have been more successful in establishing cumulative dialogue.    To evoke this ongoing process let us review several moments in the career of    Latin American mind and sensibility in our century as reflected in such realms    as literature, the essay, philosophy, and social science. This is no definitive    mapping but a personal reconnaisance of openings toward what are frequently    called national <i>reality </i>and cultural <i>identity</i><a name="10not"></a><a href="#not10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our first moment is the key to the rest,    for it demonstrates engagement with the industrial West without mimicry. I refer    to Spanish American Vanguardism, known in Brazil and Europe as Modernism. In    Europe Modernism had early antecedents as an attitude both critical and celebratory of<i> modernization.    </i>One might call it a cognitive assault on the contradicions of modernity.    Not until its golden age of 1910-30, however, did Modernism, from its Parisian    arena, make its impact on Latin America. At this point Europe experienced the    crisis of nerve associated with technification, commodification, alienation,    and rampant violence, as these found expression in neo-Marxian contradictions,    Spenglerian decadence, and Freudian invasions of the subconscious. The Latin    American <i>prise de conscience </i>required precisely this dissolution of evolutionary    and meliorist rationales. Europe now offered pathologies and not simply models.    Disenchantment at the center gave grounds for rehabilitation at the rim.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">São Paulo was a predestined Modernist    center. Once the impoverished homeland of Brazil's half-breed pathfinders <i>(bandeirantes),    </i>it had exploded as the industrial capital of the continent. Here young intellectuals    were well positioned to adopt Modernist technique and, in their <i>Brazilwood    </i>and <i>Anthropophagy </i>manifestoes, to use it for encoding messages directed    to the metropolitan countries. Having filled the pockets of the capitalist West    for centuries with exports of brazilwood, gold, and coffee, the time had come    for Brazil to export poetry, to enrich and pluralize Western mind and sensibility.    <i>Anthropophagy </i>recalled the cannibalism of Brazil's first <i>natives,    </i>who neither rejected nor mimicked European culture but consumed its bearers    to ingest their <i>magic </i>powers. José Carlos Mariátegui, a Peruvian contemporary    of the Brazilian Modernists and famous for his essays interpreting his nation's    <i>"reality"</i>, is not primarily remembered as a vanguardist. Yet    he was in fact a devotee of surrealism which, by decomposing the solid bourgeois    world into absurd fragments, showed him how to extract Marxism from its positivist    armature to give its message mythic beyond merely scientific force (NUNEZ, 1978,    p. 69-87).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mariátegui's <b>Seven Essays</b> (1928),    like Paulo Prado's <b>Portrait of Brazil</b> of the same year, linked Modernism to the national-character    essayists of the 1930s. Here was a genre that paid heed to history, culture,    philosophy, and psychology and less to economics and government, despite the    world depression and its political crises. Ezequiel Martinez Estrada published    his <b>X-Ray of the Pampas</b> in 1933, at the threshold of Argentina's <i>infamous    decade. </i>Yet his X-ray was not of sociogeographic <i>reality </i>in Mariátegui's    sense but of the Argentine mind. The quest leads to cultural and spiritual biography    and, as it enters the domain of psychoanalysis, suspends historical time. The    Argentine is an orphan of tradition, condemned to solitude, engrossed in a private    self. Only when the specters of the past are brought to consciousness can they    be exorcised to allow Argentines to live together in health. Germans from Schopenhauer    and Nietzsche to Scheler and Spengler marked the cast of Martínez-Estrada's    thought, as did Ortega and Freud. In this he was akin to Samuel Ramos, whose    <b>Profile of Man and Culture in Mexico</b> appeared in 1934. Both men saw collective    psychology as the key to national therapy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the invertebrate    subcontinent of Brazil came a trio of books offering quite divergent diagnoses<a name="11not"></a><a href="#not11"><sup>11</sup></a>.    In <b>The Masters and the Slaves </b>(1933) Gilberto Freyre became a Freudian    by private invention in his search for archetypes that govern behavior and institutions;    his fascination with ethnicity, sex, and authority; and his inertial view of    historical process. Much as Freud labored to normalize the idea of sexuality,    so Freyre sought to legitimize Iberian culture in the tropics. In stark contrast,    <b>The Colonial Background of Modern Brazil</b> of Caio Prado Júnior in 1942    (preceded by an essay of 1933 giving a materialist interpretation of Brazil's    political evolution) dismissed any nostalgia for cultural roots in rendering    Brazil's past as a function of production, distribution, and consumption. Adopting    a propulsive rather than Freyre's entropic view of history, Caio Prado explained    change as a resultant of the international division of labor and the role played    therein by stronger countries. Prado's pioneer work would bolster the economistic    argument twenty years later but, for the moment, offered little help for the    <i>identity </i>quest because he disregarded cultural destinies and world outlooks.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the third book, <b>Roots of Brazil</b>    (1936), Sérgio Buarque de Holanda proposed a dialectical version of Brazilian    history rooted in dyadic constructs of Weberian inspiration. His master split    emerged as that between the affective and diffuse ties among persons in Brazil    and the juridical assumptions of Western liberalism with its amoral balancing    of private egotisms (Cf. Da Matta's analysis referred to above). While affect,    or <i>cordiality, </i>is therapy for rationalization and depersonalization,    it loses force beyond a small human circle; it cannot cement extended forms    of social organization, nor is it a reliable source of normative principles.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For all their differences, the writers    considered thus far addressed national <i>reality </i>by assuming a relation    of tension between the Iberian legacy and the West at large. From this traffic    between localism and universalim, new <i>identities </i>were to be forged. In    the exchange, however, Latin America suffers handicaps: first, the mother countries    could not endow their colonies with <i>modern </i>institutions and ideologies;    second, contemporary Latin America remains traumatized (except in Freyre's view)    by the predatory violence of European conquest and settlement. Yet to achieve    <i>identity </i>would seem to require assuming at the outset that one finds    oneself to be at a viable center.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In<b> Cuban Counterpoint:    Tobacco and Sugar</b> (1940), Fernando Ortiz dispenses, except by implication,    with history conceived as political and cultural invasion of an exotic periphery.    Instead, he features two agricultural crops that define the native landscape    of every Cuban. He starts with Cuban <i>reality </i>rather than working his    way toward it. In this he is close to the lesson of São Paulo's Brazilwood and    Anthropophagy manifestoes. He    deduces his story from the biotic requirements of two forms of vegetation. Tobacco    and sugar are defined not as currency in capitalist exchange but as products    of Cuban soil that <i>in themselves </i>dictate institutional arrangements and    ways of life. Ortiz starts with the land and its fruits (as did the early Marx    and Engels in <b>The German Ideology</b>), not with human contrivances, and    adopts the ludic and poetic attitude of the Modernists. Only after he personifies    his two crops does he smuggle in the instrumental concerns of history (markets,    economic organization, production systems), now subordinated to preexisting    Cuban <i>identity </i>that Ortiz, the ethnologist, accepts with humor, assurance,    and an eye to common-sense therapy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next step beyond    the experimentalism and expressive release of the Modernists and the reconnoitering    of the essayists was toward precision, consistency, and hemispheric generalization.    A promising locus by the 1940s was Mexico, whose Revolution had sunk roots,    matured, and, it seemed, translated the disparate hopes of the 1920s into a    program of domestic cultural inspiration. Political and economic developments    that have cast doubt on whether a <i>revolution </i>did in fact occur still    lay ahead. Two further factors enhanced the Mexican position. First, the Revolution    was premature for true Modernists to have become guides. Older hands retained    intellectual mentorship (Alfonso Reyes, Antonio Caso, José Vasconcelos) and    could adapt to new situations within the large philosophic perspectives of an    earlier period. Second was the exodus of Spanish intellectuals to Mexico in    the 1930s<a name="12not"></a><a href="#not12"><sup>12</sup></a>. They came with professional, international-level competence    in the arts, letters, and sciences. Their anti-dictatorial politics placed them    to re-legitimize the central Iberian component of Spanish American culture that    had been so problematical since independence. As Europeans, moreover, they could    expand the question of New World <i>identity </i>to its hemispheric dimension.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ea/v2n2/2a05f3.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This moment of the twentieth-century    <i>prise </i>was marked by the ascendancy of existentialism and phenomenology,    diffused directly from France and Germany or via Ortega y Gasset and the <b>Revista    de Occidente</b>. Although Spanish emigres in Mexico gave anchorage and inspiration    for what Miró Quesada calls the awakening of the Latin American philosophic    "<i>project", </i>the movement was polycentric (MIRÓ QUESADA, 1974)<a name="13not"></a><a href="#not13"><sup>13</sup></a>.    In Argentina, for example, Francisco Romero was the complement to José Gaos    in Mexico. Latin American philosophers, no longer <i>mere </i>"pensadores",    were now less hostage to circumstance and more confident in managing generality.    Even Ortega's homily <i>"l am my self and my circumstance" </i>leads,    epistemologically, from the general to the particular, not vice versa. Phenomenology    echoed the pretensions of Catholic thought to universalism and self-legitimation.    It could also claim the scientific rigor of positivism without relegating Latin    America to an inferior stage of <i>evolution. </i>Finally, as Mannheim recognized,    its historicism was congenial to the search for collective identity; it therefore    provided a level of generalization appropriate for the vague but persistent    notion of a Latin America civilization (MANNHEIM, 1929, p. 296-300).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the late 1950s our story line splits    into two halves, scientific and literary, under pressures both domestic and    external. The professional schools that for generations had validated the status    and careers of upper-class sons were ill-suited nurseries for the cadres needed    to expand bureaucracies and private enterprise at a time when <i>economic development    </i>was being internalized. The remedy was to create faculties of administration    and social science on an emergency schedule. Earlier, a few institutions (University    of São Paulo, El Colegio de México) had attempted to adapt curricula to domestic    society and culture. But the perceived need to apply <i>science </i>to human    affairs was now so urgent and the funding for academic infrastructure so abundant    that there was little time for judicious redesigning    of foreign curricular models, much less for creative innovation <i>in situ.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The apparent paradox was that the North    Americanization of universities (with generous European and domestic accents,    to be sure) occurred precisely when large sectors of the new academic establishment    were drawn to one or another brand of activist or intellectual Marxism  or    else simply to the idea of Marxism. After its transplantation in the revisionist    version of Juan B. Justo and the "indigenous" version of Mariátegui,    Marxism had fallen into eclipse as a result of disenchantment with Stalinism    in the 1930s, the Allied war against fascism in the 40s, and the developmentalist    hopes of the 50s. Apart from the party apparatus, only a few intellectual stalwarts    like Caio Prado Júnior and Animal Ponce, along with the Cuban journal <b>Dialéctica</b>,    kept alive its intellectual promise. Suddenly, with the economic polarization    of national societies, the collapse of developmentalism, the loss of faith in    the "benevolence" of international capitalism, and the stirring example    of a "fresh start" in Cuba, Marxism regained    its initiative.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The joint hegemony of North American    methods and Marxist interpretations in the social sciences was paradoxical but    not illogical. For, as we have suggested, Marxism did not represent an <i>epistemic    break </i>with Ricardian economics but was its logical culmination. Both Anglo    American empiricism and Marxian scientism strive to unmask a social reality    that is more concrete and definitive than the <i>realidad </i>evoked by the    <i>pensadores, </i>which had a Hegelian promissory cast to it. Both array branches    of inquiry on a hard-to-soft scale, or from infrastructure to superstructure.    Because the <i>pensadores </i>had implicity upended this hierarchy, the new    <i>scientists </i>found them <i>soft </i>and <i>subjective. </i>There is no    mystery, then, to the fluent academic traffic between empiricists and Marxists,    for while their politics are poles apart, their ideologies, in Dumont's comprehensive    meaning, are similar. However much their therapies    differ, both accept the vision of a Latin America that is host to implacable    capitalist structures reaching to the taproots of society, and both fix upon    highly instrumental goals.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For an <i>ideological    </i>alternative to scientism we look to a fifth moment of the ongoing <i>prise    </i>that is concurrent with the fourth. I refer to literary and artistic creation,    although to retain focus I limit myself to the marvelous realism of the novelists.    We must accept the fact that since the 1960s Carpentier and Garcia Márquez have    become more recognized in the West at large than have Pablo González Casanova    and Fernando Henrique Cardoso. One therefore assumes their messages to be of    comparable significance. The challenge is to imagine what transaction might    occur between novelists and scientists.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the last century    the debt that Marx and Engels owed to Balzac and Dickens was self-confessed;    without the novelists' sweeping social panoramas, the scientists' understanding    of commodification and reification in bourgeois, consumerist Europe would have    been greatly impoverished. But what has the Latin American scientist made of    <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude, </i>beyond cherishing it as a monument to    domestic imagination? The fact is that even a Marxist finds more useful <i>evidence    </i>in treatises of the Chicago Boys than in the literary creations of his compatriots.    Let me venture an explanation. The ideological split that has characterized    Latin American intellectual endeavor since <i>ca. </i>1760 has finally become    public. The keenest sensibilities of the past were quite aware of it as were,    for example, Machado de Assis and Mariátegui in their different fashions. But    now, at the present impasse, bifocality has become pathological and requires    optometrical correction.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Simply stated,    the issue is this. The scientists, whatever the provisos and nuances of their    analyses, <i>rationally </i>perceive Latin America as <i>inserted into </i>explicable    schemes of metropolitan domination, manipulation, and desacralization<a name="14not"></a><a href="#not14"><sup>14</sup></a>.    The <i>marvelous realists </i>on the other hand, however <i>leftist </i>their    political sympathies, <i>instinctively "marvel at</i>" the intransigent    resistance of their societies to the imperatives of Western rationalism, capitalism,    and political management. How do we bridge these two apparently antithetical    visions? The very fact that the dialectic has become simultaneous rather than,    as in our version of it since the 1920s, linear suggests finally the possibility,    the multiple possibilities, for historical engagement  if not, in any simple    sense, for <i>synthesis.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is not he    place for an exegesis of marvelous realism, for book-length treatments of the    term are already in place<a name="15not"></a><a href="#not15"><sup>15</sup></a>.    Suffice it to distinguish between magic realism  which blends magic into the    world and creates ambivalence for causal interpretation  and marvelous realism     which blends the unaccustomed (<i>lo insólito</i>) into the workaday    world, making the marvelous conterminous with <i>reality </i>without eliciting    dread or portentous mystery and without necessarily laying causal process under    direct question.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How then do we connect the marvelous/magic    realism of the literati with the neopositivism of empiricists, Marxists, and    dependency theorists? And how do we explain that the novelists are more compelling    than even the most agile and innovative of the scientists? Foucault gives us    clues if we are at home in the rarefied air of French post-structuralism. But    if we wish to pluck the fruit of understanding from our own garden, we consult    those who are placed to make transactions at mid-point on the priapic scale    of hard-to-soft <i>specialists, </i>namely anthropologists and historians.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Historians, alas,    have temporarily disqualified themselves as they fight the taint of humanism,    deluging us with more charts and tables than even economists need. But the anthropologist,    more secure in his scientific standing, risks speculative ventures.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian anthropologist, we saw,    finds his society to be one of multiple ethics. His culture confronts the scientific    premises of Western thought with a <i>seduced truth </i>of African inspiration    which, because it is symbolic, is also reversible. Thus the Western axiom that    exchange creates surplus, and from it linear accumulation, may yield to the    presumption that exchange is reciprocal and therefore requires restitution.    Afro-derived culture is not grounded in universal truth but in a seductive truth    that toys with appearances and suspends universais as it seeks emancipation    from sense and logic. The solemn <i>resurrexit sicut dixit </i>of the colonial    prayer has become for the people <i>Reco-Reco Chico disse. </i>Once it is ritualized    truth is relativized, purged of univocal, doctrinal meaning. Brazil's <i>terreiros,    </i>or ritual arenas, become radiating centers that expose reversibilities of    the global society (SODRÉ, 1983). Similarly in Spanish America, Colombian peasants    and Bolivian tin miners, instead of surrendering abjectly to the commodity fetishism    and human degradation of capitalism, resist the <i>laws </i>of economics by    anthropomorphizing their domination in the form of contracts with the devil.    In so doing, they reenact the first historical moment of subjection or enslavement    to ressurrect a demonic figure who will thwart rationalization and dehumanization    (TAUSSIG, 1980).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the boundary between rationalization    and <i>enchantment </i>were to coincide with a horizontal split between privileged    and desinherited classes, we might assume that rationalization will continue    a <i>downward </i>invasion through the social levels to produce a society that    is available for massage or cooptation by a <i>hegemonic </i>ideology. But such    is not the case. The Brazilian studies show that Umbanda cult organization,    far from respecting class divisions, cuts athwart them and extends informal    structures to the highest political and military levels    (BROWN, 1979, p. 270-304). We have also the evidence of the novelists of the    1970s who pursued to <i>insólito </i>not in the domain of the populace but in    the careers of the caudillos who governed them and who confronted, in <i>marvelous    </i>ways, the intrusions of Western imperialism (ECHEVARRÍA, 1980, p. 205-28/MARTIN,    1982, p. 207-27).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The intellectual moments just sketched,    while far from exhaustive, suffice to indicate, first, why and how the hard-soft    construction of experience might bend toward one that lends philosophy, arts,    letters, and religion a contextual role for scientific and policy-specific endeavor;    and second, that the unfolding of sensibility has not been a linear but a multicyclical    process to be apprehended simultaneously. The interactions, whether actual or    imaginable, are endless. Because the last two of our moments, science and marvelous    realism, both became public moments in the 1960s, strategic roles were created    for minds of ambidextrous vocation such as pholosophers, anthropologists, a    <i>poet-pensador </i>(Octavio Paz), a poet-economist (Gabriel Zaid), or a literary    critic-sociologist (Antonio Cândido). For being more closely engaged, the dialectic    now carries us forward more swiftly while allowing, indeed requiring, recovery    of Modernism, the <i>identity </i>essay, and Orteguian perspectivism. The respective    authors are recovered, however, not as precursors but as participants. Their    messages enter a forum for cumulative discourse.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Rediscovering    the People</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We seem to have floated to an ionosphere    of words, images, and conjecture. But as recent centuries have increasingly    distanced thought from its object (Cf. Cassirer's <b>An Essay on Man</b>), the    acrobatics it performs to achieve rapprochement need not alarm us. In Latin    America, where the organizational mind has not managed to impose itself on the    general will, we must welcome a few verbal and conceptual calisthenics if we    are to recover a <i>reality </i>that empiricism and Marxism do as much to    disguise as to disclose.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What I have merely hinted at thus far    is that Latin America's intellectual efforts since the 1920s (plot them as you    will) aim toward discovering the <i>people. </i>Earlier Europeans knew this    to be the starting point; but since people were not yet <i>visible </i>(history    written <i>from the bottom </i>has come three centuries too late) they had to    conjure up a presocial condition and then restage a presumed social contract     unless, like More and Montaigne, they started with the Tupi Indians. In this    case they found that men are by nature <i>natural, </i>which Oswald de Andrade    maliciously rediscovered with Anthropophagy. Locke was lucky enough to stumble    on a definiton of people that <i>seemed </i>to recognize <i>natural </i>propensities    yet afforded Western history a new point of traction. For Latin America such    a definition is more challenging, first because the <i>people </i>are culturally    diverse and socially segmented; second because the founding principles of Ibero-Catholic    governance were shrewdly oriented to accommodate heterogeneity; and third because    the motif of politics has for five centuries been social control rather than    participation. Hence the obstacles to a <i>hegemonic </i>ideology that requires    uncoerced assent to <i>self-evident </i>principles rather than evasive acquiescence    in structures of authority.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us probe further into our ideological    puzzle. One might make the case that the lot of the Latin American common man    has scarcely improved since colonial times, perhaps even worsened. Without devising    economic or psychic indices to prove the presumption, let us review the public    agenda of the region which after two centuries remains largely unfulfilled:    abolition of "servitude"; minimum welfare standards; republican institutions;    universal political participation; intemalization of technological innovation;    domestic capital accumulation; safeguards against foreign manipulation and intervention.    Latin America might seem to be in permanent stasis were it not that the new    historiography discovers, for every century since the sixteenth, unceasing transition from caste to class, from    personal to commercialized human relations. This neo-evolutionary view suggests    that fresh ideology should be forged in reaction toand therefore on terms dictated    byimpinging capitalism. But if an already "Western" agenda is so    largely unachieved, why does the ideology from which it sprang seem eternally    appropriate? Need we interpret Latin America "stasis" to represent    sheer ineptitude for modernization, or does it betoken an intransigent historical    identity with psychic resources more durable than even those of "hegemonic"    nations? Is there a tacit ideology of resistance or, in a term that has regained    currency, primal <i>liberation </i>that should be set against the Manchester    agenda of peace, prosperity, and private indulgence? Is ideology inevitably    <i>"surppressive and lacunar," </i>as in Chaui's description, or might    it be premissive and pluralist? Can we, that is, start with a matrix or <i>"grid    of consciousness" </i>as Dumont counsels, or must we accept only the modular    units for a prefab house  the "agenda" outlined above - whose design    was lost in shipment?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To imply, as 1 earlier have, that ideology    in Latin America is in search of a <i>social contract </i>is a way of saying    that it needs a temporal benchmark, whether historical or mythical. To constitute    a polity is to enter history, and it is appropriation of history that bedevils    the proto-ideologists whom we have considered. Brazilian Modernists prescribed    symbolic reenactment of the Indians' anthropophagy, a ritual ingestion of foreigners    and their powers. Essayists and neo-naturalist novelists found that noncumulative    history is immersed in prehistoric geography. Ontologists asked whether Europeans    truly <i>discovered </i>the New World or whether America is still being <i>invented.    </i>Marvelous realists imagine a circular time that merges myth with present    circumstance. All this makes one suppose that <i>natural, </i>precontractarian    man still inhabits Latin America. Where can he be found?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Far be it from me to reinvent a creature    who frequents the pages of Guimarães Rosa, García Márquez, and Roa Bastos. Instead    with the help of the poet-economist Gabriel Zaid, let us    make clear that he is not <i>homo aequalis </i>or <i>economicus </i>who arose    with the Western revolution of values (ZAID, 1979). I choose Zaid simply because    he can manage statistics while looking past them. He takes us to Mexico, but    with queries that make the case emblematic.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zaid's theme is    <i>"unproductive progress</i>", and his master construct is a <i>"pyramided"    </i>society that offers one third of the population shelter under the pyramids.    Like Octavio Paz, Zaid evokes Aztec imagery, in search not of historical continuities    but of Foucaldian recurrent discourse. His emphasis seems apt for segmented    Indo-American societies from Mexico to Bolivia. Comparable treatment of the    Afro-American tier of societies from the Antilles to Brazil might give more    play to an informal ethic of accommodation between common folk and the public    powers. (The Euro-American societies of the southern cone, which entered <i>blockaded    </i>situations in the twentieth century, lack the ethno-ideological pluralism    of Indo  and Afro-America. It may be significant that the latter societies    have been receptive to the praxis of Liberation <i>Theology, </i>while Argentine    intellectuals were driven in the early 1970s to the more fully conceptualized    premises of Liberation <i>Philosophy</i>.)</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zaid takes Mexico    as a society unto itself. After all, if a nation of seventy-five million souls    has, during a century and a half, been painfully <i>forged </i>so that nearly    all its people have at least a sense of belonging  if not of incorporation    or participation - it would be cynical to insist that sovereignty is <i>passe    and </i>that a <i>"peripheral" </i>nation is merely a puppet of external    commercial and financial manipulations that even a Harvard or Sorbonne graduate    student can scarcely unravel. A large national unit is still sovereign, and    it can at any moment stop importing whiskey or Stanford educational advisors.    More important, if it is a country with a limited home market, it can resolve    not to satisfy insatiable needs <i>à la </i>Ricardo (production) but to provide    would-be consumers with inexpensive means to satisfy their own modest and immediate    wants. That is, ideology  whatever its universal attunements may be  is here    to spring from an ancient community, cast in an idiom of self-recognition as    well as norms and aspirations. It should not primarily react to systemic domination,    for the society itself is not systemic but architechtonic (or pyramided). A    people who make no consistent political contribution and provide a marginal    and erratic market for products that the state incurs huge debts for producing    is systemic in only a Pickwickian sense.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The canonical explanation that dominant    classes control the pyramid of the state and the semi-autonomous pyramids of    business, labor unions, universities, <i>et al. </i>collapses into the tautology    that groups of wealth and power tend to be <i>dominateurs </i>and not <i>domines.    </i>Hegel's analysis of the master-slave relation was more subtle, but Marx    slyly stood Hegel on his head precisely to give his own argument an evolutionary,    systemic outcome. Zaid attributes less to the feral instincts of <i>dominateurs    </i>or the greed of international capitalism and more to blind acceptance of    a systemic economics purveyed by progressive consultants. In the years 1970-76,    when the caloric consumption of Mexicans decreased by 5%, the budget of the    National University rose by 600% and those of the provincial universities by    1,400%. One implication of this phenomenon is that the mere presence of the    non-pyramided population feeds the growth of the pyramids. That is, a destitute    village, simply by existing, creates a <i>need </i>for anthropologists, bankers,    contractors, <i>et al. </i>The notion of distributing tax revenues directly    to the people is ridiculed in light of the <i>rural idiocy </i>of folk who assume    debts at 100% interest to buy plows and fertilizer which they know they must    slave to repay. The pyramidal norm is an <i>8% </i>loan, arranged through <i>connections,    </i>for a trip to Miami or an extra car or a house which is endlessly <i>pyramided    </i>through further <i>connections. </i>In this fashion the iron rationality    of the dismal science is transmogrified into the euphoric credo of triumphalism.    The pharaonic persuasion of course requires elaborate casuistry in the form    of such axioms as:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) that constructing      an immense urban cloverleaf to save bureaucrats ten minutes' commuting to      non-productive jobs is a better investment that fifty thousand bicycles for      rural villagers; or</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) that chronic      shortages of domestic food staples are less significant than the permanent      availability of J&amp;B whiskey, LP's (Vivaldi and rock), color TV. VW's,      and vernacular translations of Lenin and Milton Friedman; or</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) that direct      family remittances from migrants in Tucson and Los Angeles are less effectively      spent than inter-governmental grants filtered through two national bureaucracies;      or</font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4) that the target      consumers for an industrializing country in Latin America should be the elites      off Guatemala and Bolivia and not its own impoverished citizens. Merely to      authenticate such propositions requires substantial overhead in fees to consultants      from prestigious foreign universities.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Had Zaid composed    his book in the economist's usual fashion  a text cluttered with statistics    occasionally relieved by an anecdotal footnote  his would have been another    dismissable exercise in pathology. Instead he relegates statistics to a formidable    appendix and raises anecedotes to the main text, where they assume biblical    force.The "illustration" that compares the indigent potter's six sons,    who work hard from childhood and marry only when they can afford it. with the    economist's six sons, who marry and acquire children's tuition bills and mortgaged    cars and houses long before parasitic jobs in the pyramids are created for them,    becomes a parable. Parables that illuminate moral dilemmas of time and place    are or should be the essence of ideology, which we refuse to define as a grand    blueprint, a mass opiate, a brave new truth of science, or verbal fetishism.    The poverty of ideology in official Latin America is revealed when we contrast    the economist, who preaches high-tech production of consumer durables (e.g.,    robots for São Paulo's Ford factories) that will substitute scarce capital for    abundant labor, with the politician, who dreams of coopting the potentially    articulate population into laddered, non-productive employment with the promise    of cars, university education, and bypass surgery. Small wonder that the <i>hard    </i>end of the knowledge spectrum has become hard like a gallstone, not like    a cutting diamond.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>A Rogue Philosopher    Lands a Hand</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly the game    of blindman's buff is ending. Deep change lies close ahead: not the arbitrary    <i>structural </i>change promised by technocrats or revolutionaries in the 1960s    nor a grand turnover in values but simple recognition of the long-term facts    of the case. For guidance, we might stretch our antenna toward those distant    transmitters. Three obvious sources of ideological inspiration are the Iberians    from Vitoria to Suárez, the British from Hobbes to Smith and beyond, and the    Germans from Fichte to Hegel to Marx. The Iberian tradition is the native one.    Its formal principle that political norms are anterior and external to the society    has become archaic, and therefore its informal and still vital principle of    <i>populism </i>(in the historian's sense, not the sociologist's) needs restatement    in fresh context. The British principle (with its French Enlightenment corollary)    represents precisely the Western <i>revolution of values </i>that, we finally    recognize after two centuries, Latin American submits to in highly eclectic    fashion. The central issue is no longer to internalize rationalization but to    acknowledge permanent antibodies. The German principle is more congenial than    the Anglo-French, for it arose in a recognized context of <i>underdevelopment    </i>and directly challenged Enliglitened tenets of Panglossian rationalism and    oligarchic meliorism. As it matured, however, its apodictic universalism proved    inhospitable to a plural ethic.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For various reasons we may be dissatisfied    with these clusters of discourse. Despite their internal contradictions and    points of dispute, they are general outlooks that accommodate to <i>situations    crees; </i>they coast on premises that gradually escape surveillance. Our preferred    guide would be an outcast, a <i>rogue philosopher</i> who challenges    vocabulary and premises and not merely evidence, arguments, and prescriptions     a thinker who escapes the dead hand <i>of a system </i>by imposing private    experience in its complexity. We surely have a choice of such <i>rogues. </i>Merely    for demonstration let us try Rousseau. As a<i> youthful pícaro </i>in Italy,    Rousseau was exposed to the autumnal season of a patrimonial, Catholic society.    In early maturity he collided with Paris and the smug pansophism of the <i>philosophes.    </i>After he died, his alone of French Enlightenment texts caught the German    imagination. Rousseau lived out a <i>Latin American </i>experience and, because    all his writings are autobiographical, they presumably yield navigation markers.    His points of reference were picaresque Italy, the <i>philosophes' </i>Paris    that would soon deify Reason, and an (idealized) Genevan polis: all appropriate    to our case<a name="16not"></a><a href="#not16"><sup>16</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the outset we    dismiss the classroom questions of whether Rousseau was Jacobin or totalitarian    (or both) or whether the <i>Social Contract </i>is internally self- consistent    or whether the general will is compatible with representative government. We    look for a grammar of ideology, not formulae. As Peter Gay has said, one should    take Rousseau's political theory as a critical instrument, not a constructive    device. Or: he is the theorist of democratic movements, not of the democratic    state (CASSIRER, 1963, p. 27). However on interprets the <i>Social Contract,    </i>one is left with the fact that when Rousseau addressed casesGeneva, Poland,    Corsicahe suspended <i>a priori </i>judgments and weighed the historico-cultural    facts of the situation. Throughout his life he held to the ideal of the polis    as a self-styled <i>citizen of Geneva; </i>yet he never suppressed memory of    his Catholic years in Italy as a <i>periquillo sarmento</i><a name="17not"></a><a href="#not17"><sup>17</sup></a>    when he lived by his wits and learned that one must judge the self-given human    being, that the fault of society is its guilt and not its organizational defects,    and that a social contract is needed not to create a community but to give form    to an existing one. One need not recover an archaic state of nature if society    is everywhere present. To capture that society requires self-awareness, not    sociology; if, then, it is rooted in persons, social thought should not, cannot,    be systematic. Rousseau's professed metier in this period, and throughout his    life, was that of musician, or one who deals in themes and orchestration, not    propositions and systems. (Note the importance of Brazilian popular music for    ideology in the 1960s and 70s.) (SANT'ANNA, 1978, p. 97-111, 223-42).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us group a    few Rousseauian reflections to bring out three themes: the critique of liberalism,    the principle of non-individualism, and the general will Rousseau's argument    cut athwart the liberal presumption of society as an aggregation of self-made    men divided into colliding interest groups. This put the stress on private liberties    rather than on liberty. It created false dichotomies between minority rights    and majority rule liberty and order, liberty and equality, self-reliance and    paternalism. Freedom begins with self and not with laws, Rousseau believed,    and the self should submit not to laws devised by philosophers but to the idea    of law as such. Where general interest is a calculus by experts, <i>common good    </i>becomes a misnomer, for people no longer share a common life. Shared experience    reduces to the capacity for private response to an alien environment. In Paris    Rousseau was struck by the evanescence of the old Roman and Christian disposition    for friendship, <i>amicitia. </i>In the <i>Nouvelle Héloise </i>Saint-Preux    observes that a man may be an instant <i>"friend" on </i>first meeting,    yet years later may become an instant stranger if one asks of him a favor. A    Parisian    shows tender interest in so many persons that he can have no real interest in    any of them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike the <i>philosophes, </i>Rousseau    refused to consider the state as an improvable utilitarian machine for increasing    happiness and enhancing welfare. This helps explain his attack on sciences and    arts in the first <b>Discourse </b>("(. ..) tell us what we must think    of that crowd of obscure writers and idle men of letters who uselessly consume    the substance of the State") and allows us to presume how he might have    judged the academic Gradgrinds and policy pundits who thrive on our own public    coffers. Personal liberty was for Rousseau not a mathematical but an ethical    matter. One had, fatalistically, to accept inequalites, but not situations of    control and dependency. Transformation of the social order required participation,    not techniques of management, consent to law and not obedience to laws.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In denying that individualism was the    foremost social principle Rousseau did not revert to Aristotelian and neoscholastic    <i>political </i>man, a creature whose humanity pressupposed and was defined    by sociability. Once society is constituted, however, men are, Rousseau believed,    indebted to one another and to the state. Such indebtedness is not dependence    but describes a relational community <i>of artificial </i>persons who are not    by nature sociable<a name="18not"></a><a href="#not18"><sup>18</sup></a>. Freedom does not therefore imply private spheres    of non-interference, which lead to competitive disunity that causes one to depend    on another's will. The rights of man cannot <i>per se </i>abolish coercion in    society, for, in Ellenburg's examples, liberals are forever dispersing crowds,    busting trusts, and splintering mass opinion. Moreover, to limit the quantity    of power is futile if the source of power is tainted. If competition leads to    slavery, so too does hedonism, since giving free rein to appetite is a form    of personal self-enslavement. The political whole must be non-aggregative and    greater than the sum of its parts if it is to make possible the foresight and    judgment that the presocial condition denies. From this assumption the question    is not how to articulate parts into a systemic whole but how to respect the    principle of diffuseness in the body politic.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From all this it follows that Rousseau    distrusted the distinction between public and private, for when liberty is relegated    to a private sphere, it is subject to public encroachment. His master split    is between the general and the particular. All groupings (family, occupation,    class, magistracy, and the like) are public but <i>particular </i>associations    that fall within the <i>general </i>circumference of the state, defined as a    society of citizens. Instead of the boundaries drawn (though often preferentially    suspended) in both liberal and corporatist polities between conflictive private    and public entities or sectors, we have here a hierarchical set of loyalties    that runs from the particular to the general good, with the latter taking precedence.    This social ideal lessens the importance of individualism, whether seen as a    cult of Romantic genius and charismatic heroes or as a broad pedagogical program    for cultivating latent abilities of single citizens. The alternative, however,    is not dreary leveling and regimentation. It is simply recognition that genius    or mere self-improvement is not a private matter but the corollary to unfolding,    communally patterned social life. Genius depends for its definiton on a shared    history.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contemporary society    was, in Rousseau's view, a legalized state of war declared by a powerful minority    against the defenseless poor. For him, then, the central concern was not social    engineering but the moral choice between liberty and slavery. Of Marx he might    have said that he tried to eat his cake and have it too, and of Bentham that    he ate a cake that wasn't his to eat. As for Erich Fromm, Rousseau was willing    to dispense with the caviar of freedom <i>to </i>if one had the rice and beans    of freedom <i>from. </i>Rousseau envisioned a radically egalitarian society    with <i>negative </i>liberty for all, that is, with each being free of the will    of another. Inequality of possessions is to be expected as long as it is not    so exaggerated as to allow sale and purchase of persons. The more the gap widens    between rich and poor, however, the more the rich abdicate responsibility and    weave the chains of oppresion with garlands of art, literature, and science.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The much debated<i>    general will </i>requires recognition of society as mutual and not devised or    imposed association. For example, what Taussig's Colombian peasants demand is    not fictitious equal pay for equal work that feeds capitalist expoliation but    acknowledgment of the intrinsic worth of all persons. Chauí criticizes <i>"release"    </i>of women from home-making to the competitive labor market because they continue    to sustain an exploitative system (CHAUÍ, 1983, p. 112). Maria Hermínia de Almeida    generalizes the point in implying that the primordial assignment for people    in a non-participatory polity is to <i>"bear witness", </i>not to    plead for an advantaged mechanism of incorporation (ALMEIDA, 1983). Ultimately    general will requires bonded fellowship and reciprocal conditions of social    life. In this, it <i>"forces people to be free". </i>For liberal pundits    the phrase smacks of totalitarianism. Ellenburg advises us to reexamine the    French, <i>"forcer d'etre libre", </i>and to ask whether this means    to <i>force </i>or to <i>strengthen, </i>in Rousseau's sense of virtue as a    strengthening of the soul. If the latter, we are left with modern conscientization    that resists internalized domination, or hegemonic ideology. Such resistance,    one presumes, is more easily mobilized in a society of personalized status ascription    (where confrontations provoke Da Matta's intimidating question <i>"Do you    know whom you're speaking to?"</i>) than in one where authority wields    the scepter of egalitarian rationality (Chaui's principle of Organization) with    its intimidating "<i>who d'ya think you are?"</i></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ea/v2n2/2a05f4.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us now place Rousseau in the context    created by our having reviewed Latin America's <i>prise de conscience </i>since    the 1920s and having taken Zaid's Mexico as emblematic, though not descriptive,    of contemporary Latin America. In so doing we look to Rousseau not for prescriptions    but for perspectives. We even create our Rousseau as Suárez created an Aristotle    or British liberals created their Magna Charta <i>ex post facto. </i>That is,    modern Latin America might discover him to be a founding father in the sense    of Borges that a writer creates his own precursors. Had Kafka not lived, we    could not read Browning as we do. Did Latin America not exist, Rousseau's meanings    would be more obscure.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we assume that Zaid's image of Mexico    has held for half a millennium and that it won't be unfamiliar to our great-grandchildren,    we wonder whether a program of economic development, abolishing poverty <i>à    la </i>Lyndon Johnson, creating formal mechanisms for increased political participation    (and cooptation), and schooling for selective release (and cooptation) of individual    talentwhether such an agenda, rooted as it is in heavily skewed political and    economic infrastructure, responds to the situation. It would seem that we should    start from an integral vision of a somewhat passive society rather than with    a set of urgent assurances of technocratic redemption and dialectic movement.    Rousseau was not a Utopian, nor did he claim to have discovered evolutionary    process, natural or man-made. He might, however, have started with the premise    that the total population of a Latin American society is already <i>in </i>the    polity, that it needn't await a signal from Milton Friedman or the Marxists,    nor the outcome of an academic debate over <i>marginality</i>, to determine    who, by socio-politico-economic indices, is in and who is out. Mexico and Brazil    and Paraguay and Guatemala already <i>belong to </i>their inhabitants. This    assumption shifts the focus from a Ricardo-Marxian emphasis on mechanisms of    change and instruments of power to an acceptance of <i>fait accompli. </i>This issue    is not how to change but how to acknowledge what exists.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we are to rescue the future from    politicians, vested interests, scientists, and technocrats, we come up against    Rousseau's threatening general will. Does this general will, we may ask, not    open the gate to totalitarianism, <i>guided </i>populism, or, in the classic    terms of Madison's tenth <i>Federalist </i>paper, a majoritarian <i>"impulse    of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens?" </i>But    these are manipulated phenomena. Rousseau's general will emanated from the people,    not from self-appointed managers and curators. To be sure, the general will    is inconstant, because it depends neither on verifiable principles of calculation    nor on hoary precepts of natural law. Yet, if it is a direct emanation from    the people, we have less to fear from it in pluralist societies such as the    Latin American than in a factionalized Western society whose pluralism consists    in multiple interests that rest on shared philosophic assumptions. Rousseau    urges us toward non-systemic situations, where the task is to make the whole    diffuse, not vice versa as in the mimetic centralist-federalist construction    of Latin American politics. Why, if multiple <i>realities </i>are entertained,    should political discourse not reflect them? Rousseau says nothing, as far as    I know, that precludes diverse interpretations of the universe or that attributes    universality to Weberian disenchantment or that denies the possibility of marvelous    realism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Admittedly, Rousseau preferred small    societies to large ones. To the Cuba of 1959 or the Nicaragua of 1979 he might    have wished to apply his Corsican recipe for small nations of social youthfulness    adaptable for small farming and amenable to moral in lieu of commercial imperatives.    Brazil or Mexico more nearly answer his Polish case: a large nation of soldiers    and academies that cultivates arts and sciences, commerce and industry, where    money is made to circulate swiftly so as to keep citizens in great dependence.    This was the perfect formula for a scheming, avid, ambitious, servile, and knavish    people given to extremes of opulence and misery, license and slavery. Rousseau's    advice for such a nation was to revive the autonomy of provincial and smaller    territorial units. Lacking the ideal small polity, one aims to segment the larger    whole in defiance of systemic articulation. The <i>representation </i>one cultivates    is not delegated power that may enslave those who delegate it but a direct and    continuing <i>representing </i>of the political claims and world views of heterogeneous    constituencies in search of liberation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In contemporary    Latin America the Christian base communities and Liberation Theology are an    obvious analogue to the Rousseauian prescription. Here religion assumes the    public, civic character that Rousseau advocated. By assembling in primary groups    the people <i>become </i>the church, inverting and decentralizing authority,    eliminating the paternal funcion of clerical <i>"shepherds", </i>acquiring    the right to speak directly to the highest authorities. The constant dialogue    that sustains and justifies the communities is a critical reflection on self    and society, a search for causes of poverty and oppression that points toward    collective understanding and ideology. Sin no longer means heterodox beliet    but any form of oppression. To eliminate <i>sin </i>requires not a canvassing    of received doctrines but alertness to signs of the times and a communal effort    to devise fresh language, ideas, projects. Such a process seems closer to Rousseau's    notion of a general will in gestation than -to Anglo-American suppositions about    opinion formation in a liberal society.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>A Footnote on    Multiple Ethics</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This chapter has been concerned not    with immediate issues and practical strategies but with the implications of    a long-term existential interlude that is starting to witness, on many fronts,    a deep-cutting reconceptualization of Latin American societies, institutions,    and their cultural premises. As I reached .these final paragraphs, a letter    arrived from an accomplished Peruvian social scientist and planner who writes:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"At this moment something more    than a preoccupation is apparent in the Latin American region. I would call it    anguish sprung from the sensation that our distance from the industrial world    and leading-edge technologies is increasing at biometric rhythms. On the other    hand there is a sense of loss of identity, of dissolution of one's own,    that doesn 't mean transformation into an </i><b>'other'</b> <i>but into a vacuum    marked by frustration where the only conceivable salvation is in the hands of    economists and financiers."</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet it is precisely such an existential    moment  marked by <i>anguish, vacuum, frustration  </i>that invites and compels    a surveying of native grounds and cultural roots. And it now comes at a time    when the venerable Ibero Catholic tradition can be remembered not as exclusively    clerical and authoritarian but, like any long-lived tradition, as carrying its    own therapeutic potential. This is not to say that the Christian base communities    just mentioned are in themselves <i>the </i>answer (who knows what forms of    cooptation they lend themselves to?), any more than the guerrillas, squatters'    invasions, and non-Catholic cult groups that opened our eyes in the 1960s were    <i>the </i>answer. (And who, after all, can predict what burdens and ironies    are subsequent to<i> any </i>"liberation"?) The point is that in the    long run the formation of radically egalitarian <i>sects </i>against a pyramided    <i>church </i>(à la Troeltsch and Weber) offers a better sociological example    for Latin America than the disquisitions of Madison, Mill, Marx, and Gramsci.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This leads me to    question Chauí's nimble essay <i>"Popular Culture and Religion", </i>which    repudiates any and all religious sects because they are cooptable by institutionalized    authority (CHAUÍ, 1982, p. 71-83). My own inclination is to keep religion right    where Kierkegaard placed it along with ethics, art, and science. Chauí does,    I admit, end up where I would like to, with the Frankfurt School admonition    that science (not religion) is the opiate of the people. But despite this turn    of the screw, her analysis is embedded in received Western philosophy; she urges    use of its resources to replace the suppressive, lacunar discourse of <i>"ideology"    </i>with an antidiscourse, or critical discourse, that will unmask ideology    (CHAUÍ, 1980, p.22-3). The objective at this exploratory, formative moment,    however, is not to calibrate Western ideology against Western science but to    canvas coexistent modes of discourse from wherever they may arise. Rousseau,    unlike his Enlightened confreres, encouraged such an enterprise.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here indeed is    a central point. Latin American societies are societies of multiple ethics,    whereas the ideology of the industrial West presumes a unitary ethic or, as    Americans like to put it, uniform <i>rules of the game. </i>Such <i>rules </i>characterize    egalitarian societies and are conducive to dissemination of <i>hegemonic </i>ideology.    In Latin America heterodox world views, notably (but not exclusively) Amerindian    and African ones in their creolized form, still persist, And they do so for    two reasons. First, the action of church and state for three colonial centuries    worked to orchestrate and hierarchize diverse world views, not to suppress or    standardize them. Second, in societies where large masses could never realistically    aspire to incorporation within <i>bourgeois </i>society, it is natural that    heterodox outlooks and strategies for reconceptualizing the social universe    have retained their force, How then can ideology in the sense of universal political    ground rules flourish in societies that are truly plural and not merely factionalized?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us take a elue from Chemoff's contrast    between Western and African music, whole implications are conspicuous for the    Afro Caribbean countries and Brazil (CHERNOFF, 1979). For the moment, or perhaps    for any moment in our existential future, we cannot expect clear, practical    alternatives. What we do require is sensitivity to simultaneous constructions    and rhythms. This we find in Chernoff's comparison between the    Western <i>"metronome sense", </i>which construes time as moving inexorably    toward a distant moment, and African music, which imposes on musician and spectator    alike the need to maintain a personal rhythm that gives coherence to an ensemble    of conflicting rhythms and accents. Western music harmonizes different tones    into chords but has no name for rhythms; its terminology (accelerando, rubato,    syncopation, and so on) refers to speed, meter, and accentuation. In Africa,    beats have names and variations, and the beat of music comes from a relation    among rhythms rather than from a dominant pattern. Alternatives remain alive.    Translated into sociopolitical terms, <i>this </i>is the metaphor that illuminates    our case. The fact that the establishment may coopt religious cult groups is    of no more consequence than that New York and Paris night clubs convert African    rhythms to metronomic linearity for the amusement of bored bourgeois patrons.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This aftherthought    is by way of underscoring what democratization must mean in lands of cultural    diversity where economic <i>"solutions"</i>, by norms of the industrial    West, are unattainable in a foreseeable future. Here ideology must evolve from    the continuous representing of the people's claims, not from imposition via    structures conceived on high. Democracy must here be thought of as a process    that refers not simply to the everlasting clash of passions, interests, and    opinions but also to the premises from which they spring and the arenas wherein    they are voiced. The path <i>o</i>f <i>liberation </i>that Latin Americans are    adopting betokens a processual goal and not the static condition of Anglo-French    <i>liberty.</i></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALMEIDA, M.

I refer to literary and artistic creation, although    to retain focus I limit myself to the marvelous realism of the novelists.</font>    <br>   <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Iberian tradition    is the native one. Its formal principle that political norms are anterior and    external to the society has become archaic, and therefore its informal and still    vital principle of <i>populism </i>(in the historian's sense, not the sociologist's)    needs restatement in fresh context.</font>    <br>   <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Latin America societies    are societies of multiple ethics, whereas the ideology of the industrial West    presumes a unitary ethic or as Americans like to put it, uniform <i>rules of    the game.</i></font>    <br>       <br>   <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="not1"></a><a href="#1not"><sup>1</sup></a>    The "aequalis" studies are an ongoing series, some now available as    articles.    <br>   <a name="not2"></a><a href="#2not"><sup>2</sup></a> Before reading Dumont's    "aequalis" studies I had hit upon the same strategy in <b>El espejo    de Próspero.</b>    <br>   <a name="not3"></a><a href="#3not"><sup>3</sup></a> The compartmentalization    of knowledge in the interest of pedagogical "clarity" some trace to    the logician Peter Ramus (1515-72).    <br>   <a name="not4"></a><a href="#4not"><sup>4</sup></a> See Diego Memeguer Illán,<b>    José Carlos Mariátegui y su pensamiento revolucionario </b>(1974).    <br>   <a name="not5"></a><a href="#5not"><sup>5</sup></a> Cf.

"Any    unit has existence only in reference to a given ego. For every ego in the community    the set of people with whom he maintains patterned interaction is different.    Consequently, there is no basis for friendship. Allegiances and alliances are    crosscutting (...). The total society, like the family, is arranged into a series    of separate, divided social roles hierarchically arranged." Yet this is    not "capitalist" individualism, for the innovator or social climber    is a laughable rather than a respected figure. In Catholic societies, as Weber    observed, the <b>virtuoso </b>is under suspicion. May N.

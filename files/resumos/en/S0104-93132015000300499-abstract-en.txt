Abstract Tupi-Guarani speaking groups were spread over vast regions of South America when the Europeans arrived. Speculation about the process of dispersion of these groups has been ongoing for decades. In this paper we point out that studying the history of the Tupi-Guarani groups from Eastern Amazonia, producers of pottery related to the Amazonian Tupinamb√° Subtradition, is fundamental to the comprehension of the mobility and internal complexity of the Tupi-Guarani.

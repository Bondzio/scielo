Abstract This article aims at exploring the effects of feminist movement in the Federal Legislative. Therefore, the study focuses on a feminist NGO Consortium that has acted in the National Congress to approve Maria da Penha Law. The repertoire mobilized by the Consortium in the case is described from the logic of the legislative process both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Federal Senate. From the results found, it is possible to state that the Consortium acted during the billÂ´s proceedings within the Parliamentary Committees in, at least, two key moments: a) formulation of the rapporteurs&#8217; decision and b) definition of the Committee&#8217;s position. In a broader context, the research results indicate that the movement&#8217;s action occurred in the processes of agenda setting and definition of the Maria da Penha Law content.

This paper investigates Durkheim's idea that Law should be understood by means of the study of a more basic reality: moral and social reality. The article approaches Durkheim's conception of Law and the diverse aspects of this more basic reality, especially the aspects treated by authors inspired by Durkheim. The final part of this paper is devoted to the problem that restitutive Law presents for Durkheim's thesis about the ties between the juridical world and the social and moral reality.

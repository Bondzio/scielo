Abstract In the studies on trans-people, transvestites, black population, women, among others, the state appears as a fundamental agent that distributes in a non-egalitarian way the recognition of humanity. There is a core bibliographical reference shared by this field of research. Michael Foucault&#8217;s concept of biopower, as a government technique that aims to &#8220;to make live, to let die&#8221;, is recurrent. When the research refers to state violence, it usually triggers the notion of &#8220;sovereignty&#8221;, also by Foucault's, as opposed to governability (a set of techniques that are life-oriented). More recently Achille Mbembe&#8217;s concept of necropower has become part of this conceptual corpus. This article suggests another concept: necrobiopower. Necropower and biopower are inseparable terms for one to think about the relation of the State with the human groups that inhabited and inhabit the marks of the Nation-State. Livable life and killable life, to use the terms of Giorgio Agamben, are forms of population management and cannot be put in a chronological perspective, where the necropower (or sovereign power) would have been surpassed by biopower.

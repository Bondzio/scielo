ABSTRACT  Introduction The ministerial composition of the New Republic is analyzed through five factors: sex, ethnicity, age, regional origin and education.  Methods The poll was performed through empirical and qualitative work about the profile of the ministers of the New Republic. Interviews, questionnaires and online information from many official websites were used.  Results The timid democratization of the ministry is shown, in terms of gender and ethnicity, the advanced average age of the ministers throughout the whole period, the priority recruitment in the wealthiest and most populous regions, but contemplating all regions of the country. Finally, it is noteworthy the astounding schooling of this group. On the other hand, it is stated that in the economic area, the professional academic qualification of the ministers is superior to the others&#8217;, and that this aspect has been constant in all governments.  Discussion Not taking into account the political-partisan alliances, inherent in the coalition presidentialism, it is shown that in regional terms, the cabinet affirms the validity of one of the principles of this model, which is the principle of the federative balance. Furthermore, highly educated ministers who have long careers do not necessarily have specific skills to the functions they occupy. They are people over the age of 50, male, recruited in the wealthiest states, who studied in the best schools. The recruitment of the ministry reflects the political arrangement of Brasil (the &#8220;coalition presidentialism&#8221;) and the structural inequality of the country.

Although the ECERS has been widely used to guide program improvement, relatively little has been reported about this practical application. This paper explores the qualities that have made ECERS useful in the USA and other countries in programs serving children from different cultures and socio/economic backgrounds. The ECERS includes indicators to assess the three basic needs common to all children: protection of health and safety, support and guidance for social/emotional development and stimulation of language and cognitive development. It is used in different countries, cultures, and languages, using different curricula, with only minor adjustments. Training materials, protocols for field practice and requirements for translations to assure comparability are available. Use of the scales in the Quality Rating and Improvement Systems in the USA, as well as widespread international use are described.

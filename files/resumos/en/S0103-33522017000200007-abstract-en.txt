Abstract The literature concerning political journalism indicates that those agents in higher hierarchy positions tend to receive more visibility in news. Aiming to enlighten relations between the office held by a political agent or the fact it is an institution and the amount of visibility they receive, the article seeks to understand the parameters to editorial production. We identify agents and institutions mentioned by 185 editorials of two Brazilian newspapers, O Estado de S. Paulo e Folha de S. Paulo. The article has three hypotheses: H1 - there is a positive correlation between being an institution and the amount of mentions received in editorials; H2 - there is a positive correlation between holding an office and the amount of mentions received in editorials; and H3 - once editorials integrating the corpus deal with Brazilian Congress, both Houses (House of Representatives and Senate) and political agents belonging to Legislative Power are the most mentioned by the pieces. We used descriptive statistics to test the hypotheses. We have also applied a t-test, multiple regressions and examined the p-value of data. Only the first hypothesis was confirmed. The second one was denied and the third was partially confirmed. Only very powerful political agents, such as the president, have visibility in editorials. The priority was mentions to institutions. Political journalism practiced in editorials is addressed to political agents that have the power of executing things or to important institutions to democracies. So, the access to public sphere is even more restricted in those texts.

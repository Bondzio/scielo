The beginning of this new century brings us serious questions, forcing us to rethink the kind of society we want to build. The space for liberty is being reduced to a mere act of consumption and democracy is threatened by extreme individualism and by the dissolution of political and civil societies. Post-modernity has created a new caste structure the included and the excluded imposed by a technocratic and functional view on political and economic orientations. Fragmentation has increased, tribalism has reemerged, and the loss of the legitimate monopoly on violence by the State has been accelerated. The application of neo-liberal ideas was accompanied by increasing international turbulence and by a succession of economic crises and local wars as had never been seen. Information technology tries to replace human judgment and the new universal language is that of impatience and arbitrariness. The "other" is transformed into an enemy. Large corporations take possession of public space, transforming it into one of advertising. Traditional political institutions are increasingly unable to provide safety to citizens, leading, consequentially, to social polarization and to uncertain environments that do not favor the articulation of collective actions, what promotes the disappearance of the egalitarian space for citizens around public institutions.

Abstract: This study aims at reflecting on cultural models related to abortion and its connection with the Allegation of Violation of a Fundamental Precept No. 54 (ADPF 54) process, in which the Supreme Court authorized the interruption of pregnancy in cases of anencephaly. It seeks an approximation between the notion of cultural model, the concept of semantic frame and the process of profiling. The assay reflects on the dynamics of the cultural models called Action, Responsibility and Punishment, within the context of ADPF 54, showing how the positioning of the jurists consolidates the scenario of pregnancy in cases of anencephaly as unjust punishment for pregnant women.

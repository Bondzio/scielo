Abstract Based on data collected through questionnaires applied between 2006 and 2009 to the audience of eight concert houses dedicated to Choro and Samba (and its subgenres) in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, this paper argues that the culturally recognized hierarchy of these genres and subgenres corresponds to the social hierarchy of their consumers. Despite the prevailing assumption of cultural eclecticism and "cultural omnivores", unequal probability of access to these different musical goods means we can still postulate that the space of production and propagation of Samba and Choro in these two Brazilian capitals maintains a relationship of homology with the social space in which are recruited the listeners of this type of music.

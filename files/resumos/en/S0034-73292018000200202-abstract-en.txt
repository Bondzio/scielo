Abstract This article analyzes a crucial but still neglected episode in Latin America&#8217;s Cold War: the mobilization of regional anti-Communist governments to oppose Cuba&#8217;s attempt to join the Latin American Free Trade Area (LAFTA) in August 1962. We focus particularly on the forces that shaped Brazil&#8217;s position, which initially supported Cuba, but eventually changed course.

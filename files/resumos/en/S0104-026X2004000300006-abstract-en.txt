This article presents the main theoretical and political perspectives, as well as the herstory, of the oldest french-speaking scientific feminist review, Nouvelles Questions Féministes, which has been created 22 years ago by Simone de Beauvoir and others. One of the main distinctive point of this review, is its will to unite theoretical quality and an activist, political position, embedded in a very firm radical, materialist and anti-essentialist perspective. In the last 22 years, Nouvelles Questions Féministes published articles which have been critical for the feminist movement. In the midst of the "backlash 90ies", the review started facing hard times, with no institucional backing, and almost had to close down. But it started a new life in 2001 - with the same political perspective - , in the hands of a dynamic group based at the Lausanne University.

Based on the Critical Theory of Society, this paper analyzes how the discourse in favor of training for autonomy is embodied in proposals for pedagogical practice concerning the early years of elementary school were analyzed. Five books, from different areas, for the fifth grade of elementary school. It was observed that the proposals in order to form autonomous subjects, paradoxically, dilute the teacher's authority as well as the obligation of knowledge transmission. Group work is prioritized to develop peaceful coexistence and, to prepare participatory citizens, pupils must offer solutions to community problems. Such proposals lead to false independence and false critical sense, and are the expression of the pseudo-preparation to which we are all subjected in today's society.

Stern contends that "climate change is   global in its causes and consequences, and international collective action will   be critical in driving an effective, efficient and equitable response on the   scale required," which means deeper international cooperation in many areas &#150;   creating price signals and markets for carbon, spurring technology research,   development and deployment, and promoting adaptation, particularly for   developing countries (Stern 2009, n.p.). Governance of climate change is part   of a multilayered process, that encompasses modern forms of steering that are   often decentralized, open to self-organization and less hierarchical than   traditional governmental policymaking (Biermann et al. 2009). As such it   involves multiple actors, scales and dynamics from global to local levels,   whose actions combine to respond to climate change. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amazonian municipalities of Brazil are involved in   global climate governance. This article identifies two different dynamics,   which are complementary, and have some areas of intertwinement. The first   dynamic is linked to the national policy to control deforestation. The federal   government started to publish lists of the municipalities with highest   deforestation rates, a "name and shame" strategy that has forced many of them   to react. As a result many multilevel arrangements evolved with municipalities,   the federal government, international cooperation agencies, and NGOs to help   the municipal governments to meet the conditions to be out of the list. The   second dynamic can be characterized by the initiatives taken by municipalities   to get involved in the international negotiation processes focusing on the   United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Reducing   Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanisms<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a>,   they have strengthened subnational, national, regional and transnational   networks, as well as have made commitments to mitigate and to find ways to   adapt to global climate change. Local governments of the Amazon have taken part   in global climate change politics.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the debate about the governance of climate change,   the Amazon region should be considered because of its role in driving the   change and also because the area is very vulnerable to global climate change.   Deforestation<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> has played a significant role in this   context. For Stern, halting deforestation falls into the three broad categories   of actions that must be taken to cut emissions<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a>. The Brazilian   government has recognized the relations between forest and climate change. In   December 2009, the National Policy on Climate Change was sanctioned as a   national law. Among its main instruments is the Action Plan to Prevent and   Control Deforestation in the Amazon. According to Nobre (1991, apud Nobre   et al. 2007), the ecosystems of Amazonia are subjected to a combination of   environmental drivers like land use change, fires, global climate change and   climate extremes. Those drivers interact and can result in the "savannization"   of parts of the Amazonian region, severe species depletion, and potential loss   of environmental services, as, for instance, carbon stocking, in a scenario   without governance (Nobre et al. 2007). The local population<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> will mostly feel these impacts.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The challenges of governance of climate change are   related to the fact that even though the region will be impacted, drivers of   deforestation are linked to economic activities like logging, cattle ranching,   soy harvesting, and mining, as well as to public investments in infrastructure   like roads and hydropower plants (Margulis 2003, Smeraldi 2008), all of which   have played a significant role in the economic growth of the region and of Brazil. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The aim of this article is to discuss how some   Amazonian municipalities of Brazil have been taking part of processes of   climate governance. Two concepts will be used to frame the discussion: one is   the concept of "governors" (Avant et al. 2010): authorities who exercise   power across the border for purposes of affecting policy. The other is "agent"   (Schroeder 2010, Dellas et al. 2011): actors who have the ability to   prescribe behavior. Based on these concepts, the article will analyze to what   extent it is possible to view these actors as agents in the process of climate   governance and how they interact to create issues, set agendas, and establish   and implement rules.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The article is divided in three parts. In the first,   it discusses the concepts of climate governance, agency and scale, which   provide a framework for understanding how local governments can exert agency in   climate governance and possible limitations for that because of scale politics.   In the second section, it describes examples of how Amazonian municipalities of   Brazil have been acting on climate governance. In the final concluding part, it   discusses these examples and draws some preliminary conclusions about the role   of Amazonian municipalities in climate governance. It argues that these municipalities   still have to face many challenges to be agents in climate change governance.   However, some seem to be trying to scale up and to participate in climate   governance. More research must be carried out in order to fully access the   possibilities and limitations for the Amazonian municipalities of Brazil to be   agents in this process.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Climate governance, agency and scale</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Avant et al. (2010, 14), global governance   describes the different, policymaking activities that produce coordinated   action in the absence of world government. Climate change has been seen as a   global problem. However, according to Bulkeley and Newell (2010, 2&#150;3), it is   important to discuss the "global" character of the problem. They argue that how   "global" is interpreted can lead to different understandings of where, and with   whom, the challenge of addressing climate change lies. Most of the time, global   refers to the physical nature of climate change, which leads to an   understanding of being an international problem. While this is true, Bulkeley   and Newell (2010, 2&#150;3) consider alternative means through which the global   nature of climate change could be understood. For instance, they consider the   global processes through which emissions of GHG are generated, or the other   scales of decision-making, which shape the trajectories of GHG emissions and   the potential to adapt to climate change. Thus, they remind that many scholars   suggest that climate change needs to be considered a multilevel problem that   encompasses different levels of decision-making &#150; local, regional, national,   and international &#150; and new spheres and arenas of governance that cut across   such boundaries. All of these are involved in creating and addressing climate   change.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bulkeley and Newell (2010, 2) state that governing   climate change is a complex process because of the multiple scales of political   decision-making involved, the fragmented and blurred roles of the state and   non-state actors, and the deeply embedded nature of many processes that lead to   emissions of GHG. As a multilayered process, climate governance goes beyond the   international regime built around the UNFCCC (Okereke et al. 2009).   Okereke et al. (2009) argue that the concept of climate governance focuses   on how governing as a process takes place, acknowledges the multiple and   relational nature of power and considers that state and society are   intertwined. As such, the concept recognizes a wide range of actors that have   participated in the process of governing climate change and points to the   emergence of novel governance arrangements.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Avant et al.   (2010) raise the question about the agents or governors in the processes of   global governance. The authors define global governors as authorities that   exercise power across borders for purposes of affecting policy. They also   examine the various sources of authority that agents draw upon and identify   five broad bases of authority for global governors &#150; institutional, delegated,   expert, principled, and capacity-based authority (Avant et al. 2010, 10).   Dellas et al. (2011), however, question who are the ones that actually   perform the tasks involved in governing, and indicate that consent is not the   only source of authority and legitimacy. For them, agency is defined by the   capacity of individual and collective actors to change the course of events or   the outcome of processes once this capacity is based on authority and not force   (Pattberg and Stripple 2008, 273&#150;274 apud Dellas et al. 2011, 87).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a study about indigenous peoples and avoided   deforestation, Schroeder (2010) analyzes to what extent indigenous peoples can   be seen as agents in designing REDD mechanisms under the UNFCCC. The author   makes the distinction between actors and agents. The former can be individuals,   organizations and networks that just participate in decision-making related to   the earth system; the latter is an actor who is able to prescribe behavior and   to obtain the consent of the governed, thus he/she is an authoritative actor &#150;   as such, an agent can directly shape outcomes (Schroeder 2010, 319&#150;320).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Schroeder proposes a typology of agency that is also   useful to analyze local governments' role in climate change governance. She   highlights that agency may arise from the purposeful steering by constituents   either directly by making steering decisions, or indirectly by influencing the   decisions of other actors (Schroeder 2010, 322). Below, there is a table for   Schroeder's typology of agency just to make it easier to relate the type of   involvement and to the degree of agency she attributes.</font></p>       <p><a name="tab01" id="tab01"></a></p>       <p>&nbsp;</p>       <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rbpi/v55nspe/a10tab01.jpg" width="552" height="193"></p>       <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this sense, actors can exercise different degrees   of agency depending on the type of involvement in policymaking. Moreover,   governance comprehends different tasks or policymaking activities (Avant   et al. 2010, 14&#150;16). There are four tasks or activities implicit in the   governance process: setting agendas and creating issues, making rules,   implementation and enforcement, and evaluating, monitoring, and adjudicating   outcomes. Thus, global governors perform the combination of this set of   policymaking activities that produce coordinated action in the absence of world   government. While the view of Schroeder (2010) is useful to indicate different   degrees of agency. The perspective of Avant et al. (2010) gives us a   broader range of activities which actors can carry out to "govern," or to exert   agency. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Climate change is a global phenomenon. For Bierman   (2006), spatial and social interdependencies are functions of the global system   that can transform local environmental degradation into transregional, or   global social, economic and political crises (Biermann 2006). That is why the   governance process of climate change is multilevel. Schroeder (2010, 321)   states that a global problem manifests nationally, regionally and locally. The   responses to this kind of problems happen in the same way. The author points to   a plethora of examples of engagement at the local level, like parallel   initiatives, transnational networks and private-public partnerships that have   emerged, many of which are governing earth system transformation in their own   right.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a process, governance can be built from top-down,   from bottom-up, or as a mix of both. Gupta (2007) underlines that by framing   problems along specific levels on different scales, the contours of the problem   change and, hence, the solutions that are relevant. Accordingly, Bulkeley   (2005) calls the attention to processes of scaling and rescaling and the ways   in which they are intertwined with struggle for dominance and control. Thus,   the socially and politically constructed nature of scale should also be   considered (Bulkeley 2005, Lebel et al. 2005, Cash et al. 2006, Gupta   2007).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Amazonian municipalities and the governance of climate   change</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amazonian municipalities are part of the politics of   global environmental change and climate governance. We should be aware of how   interactions from global to local occur, and how they can drive the way   governance arrangements are built enabling, fostering, constraining or   hindering actor's ability of prescribing behavior and participating in decision-making.   Amazonian municipalities of Brazil can exert different degrees of agency,   depending on their type of involvement in global climate policymaking   (Schroeder 2010). Moreover, these municipalities can perform several tasks in   climate governance besides rule making, like setting agendas and creating   issues, implementation and enforcement, and evaluating, monitoring, and   adjudicating outcomes (Avant et al. 2010). As mentioned, we consider two   dynamics of climate governance. Below we discuss both of them.</font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The national policy to   combat deforestation and global multilevel arrangements involving   municipalities</font></h5>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Brazilian government sees control of deforestation   as a goal that is broader than climate change mitigation, but it recognized the   relationship in the national climate change law (Law no. 12,187, dated December   29, 2009). It was sanctioned right after the UNFCCC Conference of the Parts   (COP) 15, when Brazil accepted to have voluntary emission reduction targets.   Thus, deforestation control is a pillar of the national policy on climate   change, and it is essential for Brazil to honor its emission reduction target   (from 36.1% to 38.9% of emissions projected until 2020).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Ministry of the Environment (MMA) stated that from   2004 to 2007, deforestation had decreased around 59% consecutively.

Such municipalities should be identified by their   records of deforestation rates measured by the National Institute of Spatial   Research (INPE) in a time range of at least five years. The measures should be:   total deforested area; total deforested area in the last three years; and an   increase in the deforestation rates in at least three out of the last five   years (Decree no. 6,321, December 21, 2007). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main instruments of such policy were: the   geo-referencing and registration &#150; Rural Environmental Register (CAR) &#150; on the   state environmental organs (OEMA), the establishment of limits for   deforestation in areas above 5 ha, and the restrictions of access to   official credits (Resolution CMN/BACEN no. 3,545/2008). The decree was based on   the idea of shared responsibility among the governments of the three levels of   jurisdiction (federal, state and municipal), and also the agricultural business   sector, considering the whole production chain (MMA 2008). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To be excluded from the list the municipalities would   have to demonstrate that they control and monitor deforestation in 80% of their   territories, without considering protected areas. For that purpose, most of the   rural properties would have to obtain a CAR.

Thirty-six municipalities   were included in that list.

Acrel&acirc;ndia, Senador Guiomar and Pl&aacute;cido Castro in Acre state,   Marcel&acirc;ndia in Mato Grosso state, and Dom Eliseu and Ulian&oacute;polis in Par&aacute; state   have received support to obtain the CAR for the properties in their   territories.

Their counterpart has been the   provision of their human resources and local transportation. They have   participated in planning the actions locally, but it does not seem that they   have taken part in the decision-making in other levels. Their main role has   been the mobilization of local actors like landowners and rural unions.

The increase of its   GDP is the result of the concentration of many industries in its industrial   area, due to tax exemption policies in its free zone, but also of royalties   received for natural gas coming from Urucu. The distance from Manaus to other   big cities in Brazil is considerable, which makes it quite isolated from the   rest of the country.

The Charter highlighted   the importance of the local governments in the management of the territory and   committed to adopt voluntary targets of reduction of deforestation and forest   degradation and to present their initiatives to the national governments of   Amazon countries and to the international community (Carta de Manaus 2009).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Summit and the   Charter can be taken as evidence that the local governments of the Amazon have   initiated a process of raising awareness about their own role in the governance   of climate change. The local governments of the Amazon seemed to have   increasingly become more conscious of role in the process of climate   governance, so wanted to demonstrate their commitment to reduce deforestation,   as well as their unique position that allows a direct relationship with the   local communities but also a relationship with the "international community."   Moreover, the local governments, on one hand, had the clear intention to show   their position concerning REDD and forests through the Summit and the Charter,   a position that differed from the initial proposal of the Brazilian federal   government for the COP 15. On the other hand, they recognized that they were   represented by the federal government in the international arena when they recommended   them to support the inclusion of REDD and REDD+ in the climate negotiations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another result of the Summit was the creation of the   Local Governments of the Amazon Permanent Forum for Climate Change and   Sustainable Development (<i>F&oacute;rum     Permanente de Governos Locais da Amaz&ocirc;nia para Mudan&ccedil;as Clim&aacute;ticas e     Desenvolvimento Sustent&aacute;vel</i>). The intention was to have a focal   point for the exchange of experiences and to promote solidarity among the local   governments. In September 2011, Manaus hosted the I Latin American Forum of   Local Governments for the Environment and Sustainability, which was considered   a follow-up of the 2009 Summit. It gathered representatives of local   governments from several Latin American and Caribbean countries. The objective   was to resume the discussions about the role of municipalities and local   governments in the negotiations of climate change and about the biodiversity   potential that exists in the cities (urban biodiversity). UCLG considered it as   an official event to prepare for Rio +20. Themes like climate change, forests,   river basins and biodiversity are related to the reality of hundreds of   municipalities located in the Amazon region. Moreover, the importance of urban   areas was highlighted for nations to reach their targets of emissions   reduction.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The recognition of the forests' role, and of the   importance of positive incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation and   degraded forests and to conserve the forest is considered a gain for the   Amazonian municipalities in COP 15. At Canc&uacute;n, COP-16's major achievement was   the recognition that cities and municipalities should be considered strategic   governmental entities to fight climate change. This gain was attributed to the   work of the UCLG group and to the Mexico City   Pact/World Mayors Summit. There are issues that the local governments consider   important to still fight for as the Clean Development Mechanism, and the   Adaptation Fund<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>25</sup></a>. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Amazonian   municipalities of Brazil: agents of climate governance?</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It must be noticed   that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has decreased significantly since   2005. In December 2011, the lowest mark of deforestation was announced:   6,238 km&sup2;/year<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>26</sup></a>. As deforestation   rates declined from 2005 to 2009, Brazilian emissions decreased considerably as   well (Viola 2010). Carvalho (2010) states that such reduction represents an   important contribution for the mitigation of climate change, around 1.2 billion   to 1.4 billion tons of avoided GHG emissions. This amount is equivalent to 20%   of the Brazilian commitment of emission reduction. Part of this reduction can   be related to the involvement of the municipalities in the national policy to   control deforestation, or more specifically to Decree no. 6,321/2007 (Assun&ccedil;&atilde;o   et al. 2012).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The municipalities   have come to the process later than other actors. The national policy to combat   deforestation involved the municipalities in the end of 2007, and the list of   the ones with highest deforestation rates was published in 2008. It was a   naming and shaming strategy that seemed to have forced the municipalities to   get involved. The Summit that gathered local governments of the Amazon region   only took place in 2009. All these events were relatively recent to enable   comprehensive analyses, comparisons and definite conclusions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Municipalities of   the Amazon have institutional-based authority (Avant et al. 2010), which   has been exerted locally. However, climate change is a global phenomenon and   its governance is as a multilevel process. Climate change mitigation and   adaptation depend on actions that must be taken at the local level. According   to the Brazilian federal constitution, municipalities enjoy degrees of   autonomy. As entities of the federation, they have jurisdiction at the local   level, a kind of "local sovereignty." They can, to a certain extent, conduct   its own foreign affairs (<i>paradiplomacy</i>),   and govern some issues that are related to climate change. We will indicate   some tasks that have been carried out by Amazonian municipalities (Avant   et al. 2012).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Setting agendas,   creating issues and making rules</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The initiatives   taken by transnational networks are mainly focused on setting agenda and   creating issues. Amazonian municipalities like Manaus, and the other ICLEI   members, have been trying to set agendas. Manaus government has an   international agenda, and has specific positions related to forests,   biodiversity, water, and climate change. Concerning the latter, Manaus   demonstrated that its position on forests differed from the initial one adopted   by the federal government. The municipality has stated its position on the   clean development mechanism, REDD+ and the adaptation fund. However, other   municipalities of the Amazon have not been so active in stating their views and   positions, or participating in transnational networks. They have only reacted   when they were called into action. The main difficulty has been lack of   material and human resources. Political culture is also a factor, as many   municipalities do not seem to perceive themselves as autonomous entities of the   federation. The majority of the Amazonian municipalities still act as if the   central government were the only actor in global issues.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the UNFCCC   arena, most of Amazonian municipalities of Brazil have only been informed of   facts and outcomes in international negotiations; thus, they have not been able   to prescribe behavior. Such fact indicates that most municipalities have had no   agency (Schroeder 2010). Manaus, and other municipalities that are members of   transnational networks, have been consulted and invited to provide input or   feedback, which is considered a weak type of agency (Schroeder 2010). However,   municipalities go beyond the international climate negotiations among nation   states, when they set their own agendas, and sign they own pacts and charters.   The Mexico Pact seems to be an attempt to make rules or to establish   commitments among municipalities. Manaus is the only Amazonian municipality   that has signed the Pact so far. Other municipalities were invited to join the   Pact during the I Latin American Forum of Local Governments on the Environment   and Sustainability.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Implementing and   enforcing rules</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 43   municipalities that were listed by the Ministry of the Environment were forced   to act. When Decree no. 6,321/2007 was sanctioned the objectives were to tackle   the sources of deforestation more precisely, identifying where it was   occurring, and also to "share responsibilities." The decree had also the side   effect of bringing not only the local government, but also "the society in the   debate about causes and consequences of deforestation" (Lima et al. 2009).   As a consequence, greater social mobilization and the presence of international   actors have been observed in these municipalities.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The multilevel cooperative arrangements that were   described above can be seen as a response to the naming and shaming strategy.   All the cooperative arrangements that were established can be considered   instances of the larger process of global climate governance. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As seen, some projects that have been implemented on   the ground were framed as ODA received by Brazil, and should be placed in the   framework of international cooperation received for development. The Ministry   of External Relations (MRE) is in charge of it. Thus, there has not been much   room for municipalities to participate in project design, planning, and   coordination. However, the national and international actors (federal   government, international organizations, and NGOs) seem to be conscious that it   would not be possible to carry out the projects without involvement from local   governments. As a policymaker has stated, municipalities are the local   facilitators in the process of climate governance<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>27</sup></a>.   Local governments know the municipal territory, landowners, leaders, and other   actors; they have contributed to raise awareness and mobilize them. Without   local knowledge and society mobilization, these projects would not be   implemented. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Avant et al. (2010, 15),   implementation should be seen a contested process, because "many rules that   high level government actors make are vague, even platitudinous, requiring   other actors to exercise a great deal of discretion and autonomy to translate   them into action on the ground." So far, the data cannot tell much about how   much discretion and autonomy was required to translate the national   deforestation policy into action on the ground. This translation becomes even   harder if we frame deforestation control as a dimension of the governance of   climate change. More actors and issues come into scene, as REDD schemes,   international NGOs, and so on. Thus, implementation on the ground is a complex   phenomenon that should be taken into consideration to analyze the governance of   climate change.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Avant et al. (2010, 15) also highlight that no   case fits the rules perfectly. Thus, it would be important to identify "the   exceptions, modifications, and improvisations by implementing agents."   Considering that on the ground implementation of policies for deforestation   reduction and climate change mitigation has been through multilevel governance   arrangements, as the ones described in Brazilian Amazonia, we need to   understand that "even if all actors agree on what the rules require, acting on   those requirements demands resources, information, and coordination, all of   which are notoriously complicated and even contentious in many transnational   settings" (Avant et al. 2010, 15). In this sense, field research would be   necessary to fully understand this process. So far, it seems that even though   Amazonian municipalities are crucial for combating deforestation and climate   change, they have not been heard when policies and projects are designed and   planned, neither in broader coordination with other actors. However, as Avant   et al. (2010) argue, implementation is a contested process, and   exceptions, modifications, and improvisations do happen on the ground.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Comparisons and preliminary conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Comparing the two kinds of dynamics of Amazonian   municipalities in climate governance, preliminary conclusions can be drawn. The   first dynamic is vertical and top-down, although it has generated many   cooperative multilevel arrangements, which comprise several municipalities, the   federal government, NGOs, donor countries and inter-governmental organizations.   Amazonian municipalities apparently have not been able to shape outcomes.   However, as they are crucial actors for implementation on the ground, more research   must be done in order to fully access to what extent they are able to govern   the process. The second dynamic is horizontal, bottom-up, and linked to   transitional networks. It has allowed some actors like Manaus to scale up and   contribute to shape outcomes like the inclusion of forests and REDD or the   recognition that municipalities and cities are governmental strategic partners   in climate negotiations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The multilevel cooperative arrangements that have   emerged, and in which several actors from global to local take part, can be   considered examples of how international, national and local actors interact to   control deforestation and reduce GHG emissions on the ground. Even if the   municipalities have not taken the initial moves, they have been gradually taking   more active roles, as it was evidenced, for instance, by their initiatives to   bid for financial resources from the Amazonian Fund. Paragominas and Quer&ecirc;ncia   are also examples of a more proactive role within multilevel arrangements. All   these arrangements have been set through a formal agreement between municipal   and federal governments, and as such the former must not only agree, but also   take several responsibilities and commitments &#150; which reinforces the   municipalities' participation and possibilities to shape governance outcomes.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not possible to   claim that Amazonian municipalities have fully exerted agency in any of the   described dynamics. Climate change is a multilevel process, but the global   scale can still limit participation in decision making. Acting globally demands   resources that sometimes are not available to local governments. The rules of   participation in international negotiations also limit their participation in   most arenas. As Schroeder (2010, 321&#150;322) argues, scaling a problem up or down   the governance scale is a critical instrument for framing environmental   problems because it places them in a specific institutional and socioeconomic   context. So several actors and multiple scales should be taken into   consideration so as to understand the process of climate governance. We   conclude that the municipalities of the Amazon are part of this process and   more research is needed in order to fully assess how and to what extent take   place the power relations and implications for mitigation of and adaptation to   climate change.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bibliographic references</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ASSUN&Ccedil;&Atilde;O, Juliano, Gandour, Clarissa C.

Lima et al. (2009) analyzed the effects of the decree   and found evidences of its effectiveness. There have been relevant reductions   on deforestation in 36 municipalities of the list since 2005, but the lowest   rate was registered in 2008 after the decree. The numbers indicated that their   participation in the total deforestation rate for the region was reduced from   49.1% in 2007 to 41.7% in 2008. Another evidence is that while there was a   deforestation increase of almost 4% in the whole region in the first semester   of 2008, there was a reduction in the 36 municipalities of the MMA list (Lima   et al. 2009). <br />   <a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11" title="">11</a>&nbsp; Interview with Nazar&eacute; Lima Soares,   MMA.

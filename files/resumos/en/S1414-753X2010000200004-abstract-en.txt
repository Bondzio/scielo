The State of Mato Grosso (Brazil) has a rich ecological diversity added to the cultural mosaic of interacting identities in the territories. However, many social groups are "invisible"or poorly known. This research aims at mapping and registering the identities of the social groups that carry knowledge and environmental practices relevant for the building of sustainable societies. In this article we present the register of 42 social groups added to 45 indigenous ethnic groups totalizing a prognosis of 87 mato-grossense identities. The results presented here contribute for the ecological protection of the ecosystems and reinforce the recognition of the collective identities that defend different territorialities and deserve specific public policies for the autonomy of their identities and their territories.

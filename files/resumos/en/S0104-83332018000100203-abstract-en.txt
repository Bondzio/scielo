Abstract Large Scale Projects, such as hydroelectric dams, have a number of consequences, one of the most important of which is compulsory population relocation. Over the course of more than 30 years we have investigated the relocation process of the city of Federación (Argentina), as a consequence of the construction of the Argentine-Uruguayan bi-national dam of Salto Grande. In this article, we analyze the unequal way in which the women of Federación were affected during this relocation process, focusing on the gender-social class and the gender-age relationships.

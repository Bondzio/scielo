This article offers an analysis of the perception of Pentecostal leaders on Brazilian politics and the performance of Pentecostal legislators over the last three decades. After providing a brief presentation of the main transformations undergone by the Brazilian society since redemocratisation at the political and cultural levels, the authors look into those leaders' views on the importance of politics in the contemporary context and on the relationship between religious groups and the political sphere. The evaluation made by such leaders of Pentecostals' parliamentary behavior is then discussed. By way of conclusion, it is argued that despite different conceptions of politics, a minimalist view of political participation prevails. It is also suggested that there is a hegemonic idea according to which - as happens with any minority - this religious segment must seek to get a foothold within the seats of power in order to influence how society is ordered.

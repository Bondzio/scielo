Abstract The present study aimed to verify the effect of government programs aimed at combating deforestation in the Amazon and possible damage to the reform of the forestry code may result in the Amazon biome. The data used in this study were: Amazon deforestation by INPE data (2001-2010) and different land uses by the IBGE Agricultural Census. Deforestation rates in the first decade of 2000 showed a drop after the year 2004 in the major states (Mato Grosso, Pará and Rondônia) Brazilian Amazon. Government policies implemented plans that were fundamental to the decline in deforestation in 2004 (PPCDA) and in 2008 (Sustainable Amazon Plan - PAS). These plans could reduce deforestation in the Amazon by more than 25% by 2010 and reform of the forestry code can promote a setback on the gains that the government has achieved in reducing deforestation in the Amazônia.

The objective of this paper is to examine the existence of integration in the Brazilian wholesaler tomato markets using a dynamic panel model that allows threshold effects to test the hypothesis of market convergence to the one price law. The results support the hypothesis of integration among the main tomato Brazilian markets. Furthermore, there are empirical evidences of transaction costs.

AbstractChile has often been characterized as a &#8220;model&#8221; since the 1990s. However, this classification casts a shadow on diversity in state-market relations. On the contrary, an approach though multisectoral comparison allows to account for the heterogeneity of public policies in relation to markets, and not confuse them under an alleged homogenous &#8220;model&#8221;. The argument is based on the analysis of sectoral trajectories in electricity, public transport in Santiago and pensions since the reforms made by the &#8220;Chicago Boys&#8221; during Pinochet's dictatorship until today. Based on press, interviews with key actors, and an extensive review of specialized literature, it shows how policies, departing from the same origin at the end of the dictatorship, took different paths during the democratic governments. Therefore, the Chilean case appears more fragmented than generally considered. Beyond this case, this diversity points to the need for greater attention to the processes of differentiation and autonomization of sectoral public policies.

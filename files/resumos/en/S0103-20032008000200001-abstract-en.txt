The paper discussed the main factors that explain the Brazilian agricultural exports. In order to achieve this goal, the paper applied a gravity model that includes fixed and random effects estimations, besides the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach. Distance, trade partners' GDP, and geographical localization were the significant variables. Moreover, puzzle effects are associated to exchange rate, partners' agricultural exports profile and the partners' agricultural share in GDP. Finally, this study highlights the potential change of the relevant variables because of specific characteristics of each commercial Brazilian partner.

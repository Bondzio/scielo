Abstract: In Spanish language, the ideas and concepts of Judith Butler have circulated for more than two decades. Its reception was not uniform since, in every Spanish-speaking country, it was conditioned by the interest and the resistance that her daring propositions produced on feminisms and Gender Studies, by the anachronisms of translation and by the dynamics of the academy and the publishing industry. In Argentina, the first translations of ButlerÂ´s texts began to be published and circulated in the nineties, in magazines that were neither fully devoted to theory or academic work, nor devoted to activism devoid of academic concepts and ways of thinking. This article explores the different forms of reception, reading and use of the concepts of gender performativity theory in Argentina, as well as the controversies that were generated around it focusing on the tensions and intersections between activism and academy. These fields can be thought of as spaces of disputes with much more fragile and porous boundaries than often assumed.

This work analyzes the convergence of land productivity for Brazilian regions from 1991 to 2003. It evaluates if there is or not beta convergence of the agricultural productivity, controlling explicitly for spatial effects. To do so, an exploratory spatial data analysis was previously implemented and the presence of spatial autocorrelation for the land productivity was detected. In addition, spatial econometric models were developed for the convergence analysis.

This article covers the participation of young people in collective actions as protagonists in the public sphere, highlighting some public policies that have dealt with issues of their daily lives, such as the reforms in education. The place of youths in these policies is questioned, in light of the occupation of public schools in the period. The ultimate goal is to analyze the impact of the action of these young people in the society and in public policies, emphasizing the political culture created (or redefined) and operated on the issue of youth participation through the use of media networks. The database is originated from research conducted on Internet websites, youth networks, and print media data in SÃ£o Paulo between 2013 and 2017. The authors of the theoretical reference used are Charles Tilly, Doug MacAdam, S. Tarrow, and Klaus Eder. Other interpretive milestones were found of authors of renewed theories of libertarian socialism, advocates of autonomist, culturalist, and civil resistance theories.

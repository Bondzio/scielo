This article will provide an overview of the rapidly growing body of empirical research which indicates that racism, in its institutional and interpersonal forms, persists in contemporary racialized societies throughout the world and can have marked adverse effects on health. After a brief overview of racial and ethnic inequalities in population health in multiple national contexts, the article focuses on the empirical research on the nature and persistence of racism and the multiple ways in which it can have negative effects on the health of non-dominant, stigmatized racial and ethnic populations. First, through policies and procedures that lead to reduced access to desirable resources and opportunities in society, institutional racism has pathogenic health consequences by constraining social mobility, creating racial differences in socioeconomic status and in living and working conditions that are hostile to wellbeing. Second, cultural racism at the societal level, triggers and sustains institutional and interpersonal racism and creates a policy environment hostile to egalitarian policies. At the individual level, negative stereotypes, supported by cultural racism, fosters health damaging psychological responses such as stereotype threat and internalized racism. Third, the subjective experience of racial discrimination is a historically neglected, but important type of stressful life experience that can lead to adverse changes in health status and altered behavioural patterns that increase health risks.

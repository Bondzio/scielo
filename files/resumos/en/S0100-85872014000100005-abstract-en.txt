In this paper, I describe and analyze the campaign for allowing crucifixes to be hung on the walls of legislative chambers, proposed by a political party with nationalistic and conservative Catholic views in the 1940s. In addition, I seek to portray the traditional ceremony of enthronement of the figure of crucified Jesus in State house chambers. This ceremony dates back to the colonial and imperial times. I also try to highlight the constant interactions between religion and secularism and, by doing that, I assume that they are totally independent and distinct fields. Both the religious and civic dimensions are constantly implicated in the situations examined in the text.

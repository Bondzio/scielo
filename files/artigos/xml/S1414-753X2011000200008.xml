<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the turn of    the century the Netherlands has uneasily been moving from a technology-driven    "hazard" approach, based on protection standards, towards a risk approach -    from "resistance to resilience" (see the section below). Experiments with risk    differentiation between flood-prone areas, building in floodplains and flood    insurance are under way. In this context the Dutch can learn a lot from the    United States where the reliance on structural works was abandoned in the 1960s    with the rise of the Chicago school of human geography (WHITE 1945, BURTON et    al 1978; 2002). This school challenged technocratic infrastructural solutions    to hazards applied by public agencies such as the US Corps of Engineers, showing    that they did not reduce losses rather than keeping the river away from people.    They argued it made more sense to keep people from getting too close to the    river through incentives and zoning and to influence human rather than river    behaviour. By contrast after Katrina, American authorities have taken a renewed    interest in infrastructural works.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present contribution    argues that the "<i>risk"</i> and "<i>hazard"</i> paradigms miss important developments    in Disaster Studies related to the emergence of the concepts of "vulnerability"    and "resilience". The vulnerability approach to disaster studies has been on    the rise in Disaster Studies since the 1980s, notably with regard to developing    countries, when critical analysts started to question the techno-centricity    of the hazard approach and the individualism of the risk approach (see <a href="#t1">Table    1</a>: Four Disaster Paradigms). It emphasizes the systemic physical and societal    forces that make certain groups more vulnerable, depriving them of alternatives.    Its major focus is on communities. Accordingly, the <i>vulnerability</i> approach    has paid attention to (individual, group or community-level) coping capacities    that came to be seen as a major counter force to vulnerability as exemplified    in a variety of vulnerability and capacity analysis (VCA) tools that emerged    in disaster policy practice.</font></p>     <p><a name="t1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v14n2/08t01.jpg"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the notion    of vulnerability already suffered from "definitional heterogeneity" (FRERKS    and BENDER, 2004), the use of the term "vulnerability" became even more confusing    when a fourth emerging paradigm, complexity, informed by developments from the    new ecology, started to make inroads in the Disaster Studies community. It introduced    a different, systemic concept of vulnerability with <i>resilience</i> as its    counterpart, based on non-linear systemic dynamics leading to adaptation or    mal-adaptation. Translated into the social domain, "social" (in the European    Union) and "community" (in the Anglosaxon world) resilience are now policy buzzwords    in several countries with a view to coping with a variety of threats including    natural hazard, climate change and terrorism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present contribution    teases out the differences between those paradigms, but also argues how they    can complement each other. It further discusses how these paradigms correspond    to and are produced by wider political dynamics under what we like to call the    <i>politics of disaster.</i></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Dutch Policy:    From Resistance to Resilience?</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the water domain,    the Netherlands has displayed a tendency towards a "resistance" or hazard approach    to water risk. It shares this feature with other coastal urbanised areas, where    resistance to just relocate rather than depend on loss reduction becomes stronger    as they evolve and grow (KLEIN <i>et al.</i>, 2003). The "fight against the    water" has led the Dutch to resist any flood risk, that is, to seek to reduce    the residual risk after technological intervention to zero. The 2009 Delta State    Advisory Commission proposed to bump coastal protection up by a factor 10 to    a probability level of 1:100,000. This was interpreted by Dutch politicians    as if a disaster could "never" happen. The resulting false sense of security    leads the Commission to encourage rather than reduce the further development    of hazardous areas.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a consequence    of its "winning mood" after the building of the Delta Sea Protection Works (1953-1980),    the Netherlands have neglected the rear end of the security chain until 1994,    when the first evacuation plan was devised. In the early 21st century, great    strides have been made to get serious with the risk approach. This can be seen    in the adoption of Disaster Risk Reduction as the sum total of efforts made    in each link of what is known in the Netherlands as the "security chain" (i.e.    the US disaster cycle with an extra "pro-action" link added). This translated    again as a tendency towards greater geographic risk differentiation, controlled    flooding, the acceptance of multiple uncertainties in dike safety calculations    ("failure factors") and acceptable risk levels.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, considering    the fact that a residual risk does remain, it remains of the essence to focus    on reducing the potential impact of a disaster as well. A risk approach extends    the security chain beyond response and relief to mitigation, preparedness before    the event, and reconstruction and aftercare after it. Next to probability, impact    (loss) is part of the equation. The idea is that by focusing on all links in    the chain and their interconnectedness, loss can significantly be reduced in    the event of a disaster. This does not only depend on the exposure to the hazard    concerned, but also on existing vulnerabilities and - to offset those - societal    capacities to deal with the impact of the disaster. In that connection, the    Dutch authorities are now talking about citizens" self-reliance and also the    newly emerging discourse on resilience is sometimes heard in debates on flood    safety in the Netherlands. The section below first elaborates on the emergence    of the vulnerability discourse in disaster studies to move on to the notions    of capacity and resilience. A final section discusses the political dimension    of those discursive changes and the need for a transformative approach.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Vulnerability</i></b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a review of    the state of Disaster Studies on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of    the <i>Disasters</i> journal, David Alexander (1997) asserted that the emergence    of the notion of vulnerability was one of the most salient achievements in the    field of Disaster Studies of the last decades. The risk of being exposed to    disaster had become recognized as a product of hazard and vulnerability which,    in turn, was seen as actively created by such factors as bad governance, bad    development practice, and political and military destabilization. This emphasis    on vulnerability was associated with a shift from seeing disaster as an event    caused by an external agent to a more sociologically oriented interpretation    of disaster as a complex, socially (as well as politically, environmentally    and economically) constructed process.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wisner et al (2004:    11) define vulnerability as: ". . . the characteristics of a person or group    and their situation that influence their capacity to anticipate, cope with,    resist and recover from the impact of a natural hazard (an extreme natural event    or process). It involves a combination of factors that determine the degree    to which someone's life, livelihood, property and other assets are put at risk    by a discrete and identifiable event in nature and in society."</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This "new understanding    of disaster also called into question earlier, ill-conceived ideas of "normality"    and "abnormality" that pervaded much thinking about disaster. Disaster often    used to be seen as an abnormality or an aberration from a linear path of progress    rather than perhaps a chronic condition as much caused by development as impinging    on it. Wisner et al (2004: 20) therefore argued that the phenomenon of disaster    should be placed in the mainstream of policy and practice.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lavell (2004: 72)    for example, showed that in the Lower Lempa River Valley Project in El Salvador    "disaster risk" became combined with "lifestyle" or "everyday" risk: "The sum    of their permanent living conditions signify that the poor or destitute live    under permanent conditions of disaster." An important policy implication was    the emphasis put on reducing everyday risk and vulnerability as a significant    contribution to disaster risk reduction. "Vulnerability to disasters and life    style vulnerability are part of the same package and must be tackled together    in the search to reduce overall human insecurity or risk." Heijmans (2004) also    noted that the difference between normal and extreme events has become negligible,    as both may be turned into disasters as a consequence of the conditions under    which people live. Hence, for the most vulnerable in society everyday life and    subsistence are already highly hazardous (see also Allen 2003). A flood itself    may not make all that much difference in light of the myriad challenges they    face, and the flood relief itself may not be much help either. A flood or drought    may turn out to be just another hazard in a long line of adversity. A wealthy,    orderly society is likely to regenerate from a moderate flood, but specific    groups in that society, with low social, financial or political capital, in    poor health, with low literacy levels or from a minority community may not.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A powerful metaphor    used to explain the vulnerability approach is the nutcracker. This analysis    explicitly links incidental shocks with structural vulnerabilities, which helps    explain why a hazard turns into a (systemic or partial) catastrophe. The Chicago    school assumes that people make rational choices, while in practice, critical    geographers have argued, this does not keep people with little or no alternative    choices, away from risks and hazards. Poverty and population growth, for example,    force people to move to steep slopes at risk from landslides, or to flood-prone    or earthquake-prone areas.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, as the    UNDP's <i>Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery</i> (BCPR)'s <i>Disaster    Risk Index</i> reveals (2004), disasters hit poor people disproportionally.    A similar number of disasters of similar intensity will claim many more victims    in poor countries than in rich ones. The poor not only have less means to recover    from disasters, a disaster often pushes them back into poverty, which makes    them again more vulnerable to the next disaster (HELMER and HILHORST, 2006).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PAR (Pressure    and Release) model (WISNER et al, 2004) is frequently used to map structural    vulnerabilities that influence whether an incident (such as a flood) turns into    a disaster for specific groups. As a result, the loss of a house may be overcome    by social groups that could afford an insurance policy or had sufficient reserves    to rebuild it, but is absolutely devastating to others. The left-hand corner    in the pressure-and-release model shows the structural causes, dynamic processes    and unsafe conditions. In the right-hand corner the hazards and triggers are    entered that put pressure on these conditions such that the vulnerabilities    are "released". The vulnerable are caught between structural conditions and    incidental shocks, like a nut between the two legs of a nutcracker.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A vulnerability    assessment predicts what may happen to a particular group exposed to a particular    hazard. A crisis often exposes the hidden vulnerabilities of a society, community    or group. A proper vulnerability and capacity analysis however can help uncover    the structural drivers and situational factors that make specific groups vulnerable,    which can subsequently be prioritized for remedial action and help.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Incidentally, the    concept of vulnerability may suggest to some that we should strive for zero    vulnerability, but that would imply a non-dynamic and ahistorical understanding    of reality. Not only hazards themselves, but also societies change continuously    - with old vulnerabilities diminishing or perhaps disappearing and new ones    coming up - hence we cannot exclude vulnerability and live with zero risk in    our social endeavors. Also, broader contexts, including socio-economic and political    environments and people's perceptions, motivations and attitudes change over    time.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The task of keeping    track of everything would be endless, which has induced some humanitarian NGOs    to concentrate on specific types of vulnerabilities only, such as vulnerabilities    of place. Or, alternatively, they focus on the vulnerability of specific groups    only, currently called EVIs in humanitarian jargon, extremely vulnerable individuals.    Specifically identified vulnerable groups include women, the landless, ethnic    minorities and others who find themselves in unfavorable locations and conditions    as a result of the political economy (HEWITT, 1983, PEET and WATTS, 1996; WISNER    <i>et al,</i> 2004 &#91;1994&#93;; PELLING,2003). Showing that bilateral and    multilateral aid and development policies have tended to reinforce the unfavorable    conditions of vulnerable groups, radical vulnerability analysts have advocated    retreating from the wider structures of aid and development. Vulnerable groups    should be given help in increasing their own coping capacities for dealing with    environmental hazards in terms of disaster risk reduction and preparedness.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Bringing    in capacity</i></b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the vulnerability    approach was widely adopted in the world of development and disaster in the    1990s, a critique points out that it victimizes and disempowers people. It would    engender a fatalistic and passive outlook and take away the agency from people,    thereby creating external dependency. In fact, vulnerability is externally attributed    to groups of people, who rarely label themselves as vulnerable unless strategically    to get benefits out of the system. In recognition of this danger of victimizing    and disempowering disaster-affected groups, Anderson and Woodrow (1989, 1998)    highlight that people have important material, institutional and motivational    capacities that can offset vulnerabilities and are engendered in individuals,    groups and local communities to deal with crisis. The concept of capacity mediates    the relative weight of people's vulnerability, taking into account their knowledge,    skills, and organizing capabilities to cope with disaster. The thinking on the    role of local capacities and people's coping mechanisms has sociologically been    influenced by debates on actor-orientation and the role of agency. Actor-orientation    is a constructivist perspective focusing on the making and remaking of society    through the self-transforming actions and perceptions of a diverse and interlocked    world of actors (LONG, 2001). Actor-oriented approaches form a counter-balance    to approaches that basically see human behaviour as externally determined by    a person's place and role in the social system or by the values and norms that    rule society.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this respect,    Anderson and Woodrow's VCA (Vulnerability and Capacity Analysis) could already    be considered an early, useful and balanced, tool for analysis, as it combines    both the vulnerability and capacity aspects. The amount of guides, tools and    manuals in this field has multiplied since then. Cannon, Twigg, and Rowell (2003)    have made an inventory of over fifty instruments that deal with vulnerability    and capacity aspects.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, it is    not sufficient to focus only on the capacities of the disaster-affected groups    and communities themselves. The role of the public sector and of public policies    is crucial in attempts to prevent, mitigate, and respond to disasters. Regardless    of whatever international aid can be offered, the responsibility to help people    in need resides squarely with their own government. It is here that an analysis    of the government institutions, the political culture and the functioning of    the public sector can provide insight into the history of a disaster and the    disaster response. Ahrens and Rudolph (2006) describe the interdependence between    institutional failure and susceptibility to disaster. They assert that accountability,    popular participation, predictability, and transparency of the administration    are key factors in the promotion of sustainable development and disaster reduction.    However, in many societies facing disaster, governments are weak, failing, or    even collapsing. Others are plagued by corruption, "spoils politics," dictatorial    rule, and predatory regimes, or are subject to "economies of violence." Many    of them finally operate through systems of patronage or clientelist politics,    as, for example, has been documented for the post-tsunami aid in Sri Lanka (FRERKS    and KLEM, 2005, FRERKS, 2010).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The field of Disaster    Studies has only recently started to develop this type of anthropologically    induced analysis of disaster governance. Its earlier a-historical, de-contextualized    models of disaster management and engineering approaches to preferred technical    solutions hardly took such specificities into consideration. However, work in    complex emergencies over the last two decades has put those governance issues    forcefully on the agenda. Pelling and Dill (2009) highlight that the field of    disasters is, in fact, a highly political domain. While we may analytically    advocate design principles for complex adaptivity, decisions made about people's    security and safety are made on the basis of a variety of considerations, not    all humanitarian, but often squarely political or inspired by the existing political    economy or economy of violence. In fragile, fragmented, conflict-ridden states,    there may be adaptive capacity, but no motivation to rescue people. In fact,    often the aid intended for them is robbed or diverted by those in power. The    "politics of disaster", therefore, as put on the agenda by the vulnerability    school in the 1980s and 1990s, remain highly relevant to our analysis. A vulnerability    approach sees vulnerability and marginality of a community as (also) resulting    from inadequate social protection (health insurance, health services, construction    rules, prevention measures, etc.) and limited solidarity networks. In the PAR    model, development is the transmission belt between root causes and unsafe conditions.    Vulnerabilities are increasingly seen as a consequence of unresolved every-day    development problems. This reinforces the possibilities that development interventions    might bring about positive change, in terms of the reduction of vulnerabilities    and the strengthening of local capacities and resilience. Many countries in    North and South as well as humanitarian aid agencies have subscribed to this    framework that invites combining relief and development in a more encompassing    approach. The Netherlands government and many agencies regrettably still treat    humanitarian aid and development as separate domains with their own institutional    mechanisms and budget lines, confounding a more comprehensive approach that    would overcome the problem of structural vulnerability in a more systematic    way.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Capacity    and governance</i></b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1990s, the    idea of risk society and state failure promoted the idea that non-state actors    should coordinate their capacities with the government to arrive at a greater    sum total of coping capacity to deal with stress. This idea was and still is    actively put into practice by liberalizing government. Krahmann (2003) for example    shows the increasing involvement of private actors in security provision, while    governments such as the Dutch state are stressing the need for citizen self-reliance    / private action (in Dutch: <i>"zelfredzaamheid"</i>) in the case of disasters.    Based on functionalist reasoning, authors like Kooiman (2000) were highly optimistic    about multi-stakeholder partnerships between social sectors with complementary    governance capacities. Multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) were thought to increase    preparedness and learning (WARNER et al, 2002).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This has been reinforced    by networks like CAPHAZ.net, which have argued that social capacities should    be enhanced, highlighting the potential of existing expertise in social capacity    building for the field of natural hazards (KUHLICKE and STEINFUHRER, 2010).<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>2</sup></a>    It also echoes Norris <i>et al</i> 's (2008) approach to resilience as a "set    of capacities" and "resilience as a process" (NORRIS <i>et al</i> 2008, CUTTER    <i>et al</i> 2008; see section below), defined in terms of continual learning    and taking responsibility for making better decisions to improve the capacity    to handle hazards.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The governance    question - who should do what - is in a way moot. It has been documented in    most disasters that local residents act as the real "first" responders, saving    and rescuing many victims even before professional aid providers arrive. As    Gaillard (2010) observes, local communities also nearly always constitute the    first line of defence in reducing vulnerability and building resilience. While    a CBDRR approach emphasizes the strengths of community-based disaster risk reduction,    it ignores the problems of communities to deal with infrequent, unusually large    events as well as with rapid change outpacing their adaptivity. Also, the "community"    in community resilience reflects an "imagined community". As Coaffee and Rogers    (2008) among many others observe, "the community" is not homogeneous and they    expect many conflicting viewpoints will emerge as to what is acceptable and    what is not in community resilience strategies. Power differentials within communities    can also prevent voluntary collective action celebrated by CBDRR. It will be    argued below that resilience, like vulnerability, is a political construct and    has its own "politics", in the way it is used and framed in practice. To arrive    at this point, we first need to explore the concept of resilience</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Resilience</i></b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 1990s    the field of Disaster Studies has started to take on board some of the ideas    coming from environmental (earth and climate) systems analysts, such as non-linear    processes, tipping points, adaptive (co-)management and resilience. Ecologists    such as Holling who pushed the concept, define resilience as "the ability of    a system to maintain its structure and patterns of behavior in the face of disturbance",    whereas stability is the "propensity of a system to attain or retain an equilibrium    condition of steady state or stable oscillation ... resist any departure from    that condition and, if perturbed, return rapidly to it" (HOLLIN, 1986: 296).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In hazards research,    the definition of resilience means the ability to survive and cope with a disaster    with minimum impact and damage (BERKE and CAMPANELLA, 2006; NATIONAL RESERACH    COUNCIL, 2006). As of recent, it was expanded to include more social and institutional    aspects. Harrald and Veldhuis (2010) provide an overview of the recent debate    on resilience in the US and include a series of definitions currently in use    by US departments and in academic literature from which we show a selection    in <a href="#b1">box 1</a>:</font></p>     <p><a name="b1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v14n2/08b01.jpg"></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those definitions    move far beyond the systemic equilibrium thinking evidenced in the above quote    of Holling's work. They emphasize a number of common elements, namely the capacity    or ability to anticipate risk or disturbance, absorb or limit impact, and bounce    back after a crisis affecting (coupled) human and natural systems. Additional    elements, however, are the adaptive community capacity, the notions of change,    competence and learning. It must also be stressed that the capacities and abilities    mentioned are not some mysteriously in-built systemic property or even anymore    "owned" by individual persons or organizations, but are a collective, shared    or networked property requiring specific forms of management and interaction.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In view of those    definitions we suggest that resilience is seen as the shared, social capacity    to anticipate, resist, absorb, and recover from an adverse or disturbing event    or process through adaptive and innovative processes of change, entrepreneurship,    learning and increased competence."</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hence, there is    a major difference between the fairly individual and instantaneous approach    of "zelfredzaamheid" promoted by the Dutch government and the systemic, long-term    and collective approach of resilience: the "zelfredzaamheid" approach of the    Dutch government is geared towards the individual (and perhaps household) coping    capacity to deal with a disastrous event, while resilience is a longer term    adaptive approach based on social learning and change. It definitely includes    response and coping, but goes beyond it and is also is more geared to social    and systemic aspects of dealing with disaster rather than only to individual    and household capacities. In this connection we also refer to Dovers and Handmer    (1992) who have proposed that we differentiate between proactive and reactive    social resilience. Reactive resilience seeks to perpetuate and reinforce the    status quo, whereas a proactive system accepts change and adapts to it.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Turning to the    policy world, it makes sense to invest in resilience. This would have to go    the earlier promoted structural vulnerability reduction, though that would be    part of it. However, as said above, the vulnerability discourse has certain    drawbacks that could be avoided in a future resilience approach. Hence, it needs    to be combined with a perspective promoting agency and capacity. The resilience    concept with its emphasis on capacity and competence embodies such an agency-focused    perspective <i>par excellence</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the other hand,    there is as yet fairly little insight in how to translate resilience in a workable    concept and policy approach. Though its potential strengths are clear in comparison    to the earlier hazard, risk and vulnerability paradigms, there is so far little    substantive work on the operationalization of the concept and its use in policy    practice. Its present popularity seems partly the product of a political and    policy discourse that seeks to shift the responsibility for mediating the impact    of disasters to the society at large.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The issue of resilience    has an important bearing on the perceptions, behaviors and responses in the    given public policy contexts. It is associated with a sort of paradigm shift    or shift of focus over the last one or two decades concerning responsibilities    and roles in public policy and with regard to the composition of larger actor    alliances involved. In a resilience-approach there is a relatively strong emphasis    on community and grassroots involvement compared to the traditional reliance    on state-delivered services. New forms of stakeholder engagement and public-private    partnerships are explored and encouraged.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the field of    disaster management such collaboration between authorities and citizens was    already promoted in the 1994 Yokohama and 2005 Hyogo frameworks respectively.    It is however necessary to elucidate the impacts of such paradigmatic shifts    for the anticipation on, prevention of, and recovery after shocks. As a grassroots    or community-based perspective has often been welcomed merely on ideological    grounds or sentiments, it is essential to provide for a critical and evidence-based    approach to inform policy and practice and enhance effectiveness in the field    of resilience promotion.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We believe that    it is useful to outline a research agenda that can overcome some of the conceptual,    operational and policy weaknesses of the resilience approach. It goes beyond    this paper to design such a research agenda, but it should minimally include    the following major steps</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Definitional    delineation and conceptual elaboration of the notion of resilience;</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Analysis    of the academic and policy literature on resilience and the identification of    pertinent issues and emerging themes;</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Building    of a conceptual framework on resilience;</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Defining    descriptive-analytical benchmarks or indicators for resilience;</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Developing    and testing a policy-relevant approach to enhancing resilience;</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Applying    framework through pilot case studies;</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#149; Proposing    policy measures to enhance resilience.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though such steps    can help and promote resilience of disaster-prone areas, there remains a need    to also critically approach the resilience paradigm. Whether or not such interventions    may have a beneficial impact depends largely on the broader political and economic    context. Therefore we suggest that alongside the policy work outlined in the    six bullets above, a more politically informed analysis takes place that looks    at and deconstructs the resilience discourse as a political project. In our    last section we pay attention to this dimension of the resilience <i>problematique</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Resilience as    a Political Project</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We saw earlier    that partnership and coordination between the public and private sectors is    seen by many as the way forward to increase resilience. Gaillard (2010) for    example sees a role for governments to enforce building regulations and service    provision, citing Colombia as an example of a central government that provides    basic services to illegal settlers. He therefore advocates a mix of bottom-up    and top-down.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, when looking    at resilience as it is promoted by governments nowadays, a more explicit political    analysis is needed. Several authors have engaged with the political overtones    of the rise of the resilience discourse, notably that in the UK. The literature    reveals different lines of scepticism and criticism to this idea. The most familiar    reasoning among these is that resilience as used "in bouncing back to the old    state of affairs" is to reproduce pre-existing vulnerabilities, inequities and    marginalising processes.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several authors    have therefore argued for a definition of resilience that is transformative    in nature in stead of only reconstituting the status quo ex ante.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question is    to which extent this is feasible if we look at the practices of resilience.    Coaffee and Rogers (2008) see a "dark side" to resilience planning", in which    "planning authorities and planners act regressively, exerting domination and    causing inequality". Discussing it in the context of terrorism, they see the    erosion of civil rights and instrumentalization of social resilience "The term    "resilience"... provide&#91;s&#93; a highly emotive rhetoric on which a host    of wider issues not necessarily directly linked to terrorism could be attached.    A new governance and policy structure has developed from this emergent policy    metaphor of resilience."</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They argue that    resilience can exclude citizens rather than promote coordination between security    providers and citizens. They criticise the creation of an ""anti-democratic    condition" whereby particular powerful institutions determine how borders &#91;between    the safe and danger zones&#93; are constructed and constituted to "control and    disperse particular activities deemed "unacceptable" and "undesirable" (COAFFEE    and ROGERS, 2008). Citizens, they claim, have become "passive recipients of    an increasingly controlled evironment."</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Along similar Foucauldian    lines, they note that ideas of "responsabilisation" and an emphasis on citizenship    being "active" with regard to self-regulating conduct within communities under    the banner of "resilience" appear directed towards controlling "disorder", "anti-social    behaviour" and "civil disturbance". By bringing social into the debate, they    are being "securitised" (BUZAN et al, 1998) or "disasterised" (WARNER, 2011),    i.e. brought into the special domain of emergency decision-making, legitimising    exceptional measures, the deployment of the military and the exclusion of stakeholders.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We need governments    to show the limits, yet the government does not seem to respect its own or societal    limits, as it is more and more interfering in citizen behaviour. The current    call for active citizenship can become a policy instrument of the public sector    (<i>GROENE AMSTERDAMMER</i>, 21 April 2011).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This Foucauldian    analysis has a particular slant. Chandler reveals resilience as a neo-liberal    project<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>3</sup></a> seeing resilience    as the highest stage of liberalism, transcending "binaries of state and society,    inside/outside, sovereign/citizen." By this he means that it is no longer the    state who rules people, they are now ruling themselves. This type of liberalism    sees the solution to vulnerability as "universalising ... preventive intervention    with the goal of the empowerment and capacity - or capability-building of the    subject to enable resilience to, in and through danger.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To him, stressing    resilience is a therapeutic axiom suggesting that "work on the self can resolve    problems in the absence of any transformation of social relations." Similarly    Reid suggests that "the resilient subject is a subject which must permanently    struggle to accommodate itself to the world."<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>4</sup></a>    Resilience backgrounds the political, the imagining of alternatives, and foregrounds    adaptivity, accepting "the imperative not to resist or secure themselves from    the difficulties they are faced with". In response to this, attention has been    focused on the need to move beyond resilience and look at wider transformations    that may be desirable as outlined below.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Resilience or    Transformation?</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current celebration    of resilience depicts adaptive capacity as a sign of maturity. This relates    to a second strand of resilience analysis coming from (child) psychology, which    usefully defines resilience as the capacity to respond to stress. Applying this    notion to societies, Herman van Gunsteren, an emeritus professor of political    theory and the philosophy of law, sees the lack of mental resilience as the    biggest societal problem of our time. We do not seem to be able to handle shocks    without losing core values, he claims. Claiming and the culture of complaint    shows social immaturity (quoted in VN MAGAZINE, May 2011). A response like this    calls for people to toughen up and "get over it".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Norris <i>et al</i>    (2008), however, note that the ability to deal with stress does not preclude    distress. Many people experience distress after disaster; and while stress tends    to be transient, people can suffer distress for years. The eventual equilibrium    is not necessarily better or more resilient than the old. They claim: "Adapted    functioning is not necessarily superior in level or character or effectiveness    to pre-event functioning; it is simply different."</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We find this a    point worth pursuing; resilience does not need to be a return to previous equilibria.    This notion is embryonically reflected in the current debate about the rehabilitation    stage of the disaster cycle, suggesting that rather than "building back", we    should be "building back better". From a resilience-perspective, "better" is    only better if it gives the vulnerable actor(s) more options and flexibility    in their coping with future adversity. Rather than to revert to the old "equilibrium",    resilience suggests a system has multiple "equilibria" and that progress can    be made by structural vulnerability reduction or the increase of capabilities.    Yet, while trying to remedy shortcomings of the pre-disaster situation, this    approach still implies largely a return to the pre-disaster order, including    the built-in instabilities and vulnerabilities and conditions of social and    ecological degradation. Building back better, too, can reproduce old inequalities    and inadequacies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some therefore    advocate to think more radically and to move beyond resilience, towards social    transformation (e.g. PELLING, 2010). This is not as utopian as it may sound.    It may be questionable whether in socio-political systems a complete return    to the situation-ex-ante is even a real possibility. The thinking in terms of    equilibria and stable conditions as in ecology and environmental studies may    not be an appropriate point of departure in polities, where the experience of    the disruption itself may already have introduced irreversible change. A second    issue is whether such a return may even be desirable, as it were those pre-disaster    conditions themselves which may have induced the disaster in the first place    and the apparent stability was more an outer illusionary fa&ccedil;ade rather    than a firm and robust reality.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Radical change    may be perceived as negative, but communities and societies have successfully    done just that - adaptation can mean transitioning to a new life. Many African    communities facing drought have already internalized adaptation as a matter    of course, diversifying crops or livelihoods or relocating to other areas where    they can access the resources they need and start a new life. Seeking to resettle    them in their old territory can seem humanitarian, but may not conform to established    patterns of survival. Likewise in the Netherlands and US, we should not expect    that people want to take up their old jobs after a calamity. After Hurricane    Katrina, some could not return, but others did not want to (GROEN and POLIVKA,    2008).<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>5</sup></a> A disaster in this    sense can be a window of opportunity for improvement. At a societal level, disasters    have triggered revolutions, overthrowing governments that were already unpopular    and handled disaster badly.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Disasters provide    windows of opportunity to rethink social arrangements such as the "social contract"    (PELLING and DILL, 2009). Several societal transformations have come about after    a shock, which acted as a "focusing event" punctuating the equilibrium (BAUMGARTNER    and JONES, 1991, BIRKLAND, 1998). Hurricane Katrina exposing FEMA's misdirected    reorientation to the War on Terror under Bush's government also may have contributed    to his administration's loss of reputation. Revolution in Honduras after the    outrage at the poor handling of Hurricane Mitch and the earlier downfall of    Somoza's regime after the 1972 earthquake in Managua are examples of similar    dynamics. Pelling and Dill (2006, 2009) however have also shown that disasters    can also induce ruling elites to reinforce the status quo on the strength of    the extraordinary powers legitimised by calamity and crisis. This so-called    "securitisation" of disaster is a domain that is largely unexplored, but could    add to our understanding of political dynamics in fragile state contexts.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Conclusion:    Comig Clean About Vulnerability and Resilience</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent years    vulnerability and resilience have become mainstream notions as useful additions    to hazard and risk. A focus on vulnerability helps us see that a systemic approach    to flood security makes little sense - while the sum total of protection may    well increase, the risk of suffering and almost insuperable loss differs between    certain social groups, and impels us to think about what to do about the deeper    roots of such disparities. The concept of social resilience by contrast focuses    our minds on the social capacities, well beyond the capacities of the formal    sector and mobilising and strengthening the capacities of communities and societies.    However, while greatly enriching our understanding of hazard and disaster, both    concepts bring counterintuitive flipsides.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, vulnerability    is not always bad. Human relations would not be possible without a degree of    "opening-up". Habermasian authentic communication could entice us to take off    the mask of invulnerability. This however may require an unrealistic degree    of human trust and solidarity. Cutter et al (2008) for example note that governments    are loath to advertise their vulnerability, as it may hurt investment and growth.    Likewise hazard-proneness is often not communicated in a meaningful way to tourists    and home buyers. For example in Limburg, the Netherlands, long-term residents    are used to river flooding exacerbated by sediment from erosion; as a result    they refrain from placing valuable goods at ground-floor or basement level.    New home owners and tourists however are unaware of this risk.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While widely praised,    resilience is not always good. The resilience project carries risks to society,    and whether promoting resilience reduces people's vulnerability to disaster    is highly dependent on one's socioeconomic standing (Klein et al 2002) and here    is more differentiated approach is called for than the generalised to promoting    resilience often implies. Nonetheless, we have argued that vulnerability reduction    and the promotion of resilience matter and can be helpful, but that they also    have their own politics. In this connection, we should be critical about the    fiction promoted by the retreating neo-liberal state that everyone can be equally    resilient.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

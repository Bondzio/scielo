The article analyzes the profiles and insertions of eight Brazilian female legislators who are noteworthy both in occupying political positions (administrative and elective) and in the general cultural media (universities, institutes, the media itself, among others). The question that arises is who are these women, which resources do they mobilize and under what conditions do they manage to become part of a space where they are so rare? Triply rare, because they're distinguished from most women when they enter the political arena, from other politicians for being women, and from the majority of politicians -men and women - for occupying the top of the political hierarchy and standing out among political professionals as producers of cultural goods.

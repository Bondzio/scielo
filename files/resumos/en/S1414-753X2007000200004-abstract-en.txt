The major presence of environmental conflicts and problems, in a favorable context of political and institutional opportunities in the late 60s and the early 70s, has brought about the rise of social groups and movements such as the "environmental movement". This article accepts this issue as the object of study in order to analyze its praxis and collective action during the last years. Starting from the idea that in Colombia the environment is an unquestionable reality composed by a diversity of individuals, groups, organizations, and communities which, from different ideological, political and ethical points of view, struggle for the defense of collective property such as the environment, the natural resources, and the quality of human life. Such repertoir of action oscillates between the replying political action, the group mobilizations, the respectful claims, the education, the environmental management and the pragmatic action of the resources management. It is concluded that, in spite of the advances achieved in aspects related to the environmental institutionalization, the creation of thought, and the identity acquired, it is still premature to constitute a political movement with the characteristics of a green party.

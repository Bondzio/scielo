Is Andr√© Gorz a Marxist? It would be more just, and more appropriate, to speak of a presence of Marxism in his thought. A thought that one could characterize as an ecological socialism - an ecosocialism - inspired in Marx, and other heterodox Marxists in his critique of (capitalist) society, and in his formulation of the project of an alternative (communist) society. There is Marxism in Gorz, and his work, being this latter one the most important in the critical ecology of twentieth century, which is not to be understood without this Marxist dimension.

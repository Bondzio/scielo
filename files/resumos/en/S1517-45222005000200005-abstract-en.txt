Based on the main theoretical-practical enunciations of the so-called "critical perspective", after taking stances in face of debates now under way about the implications of "globalization" and the "imperialist phenomenon", as well as conducting a synthesis of the distinct components of what its author has been calling "a new Pan-American order", this article carries out a critical analysis of the distinct projects of multinational integration under development in Latin America and the Caribbean: the System of Central American Integration (SICA), the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Andean Community (CAN) y el Common Market of the south (MERCOSUR). Based on that analysis - and taking into account some of the enunciations of the Bolivarian Initiative for the Americas and the Caribbean (ALBA), recently made public by the presidents of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Hugo Ch√°vez, and Fidel Castro, respectively - the author proposes some ideas linked to what he calls "a new paradigm for multinational integration in Latin America and the Caribbean", which, in unison, would be able to confront the "coercive integration" encouraged by the US government (through the FTAA and the other FTAs) with other Western governments, as well as to overcome the limited results of "open regionalism" encouraged since a decade ago by the Economic commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL).

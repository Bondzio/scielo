The purpose of this paper is to discuss the extension of ontological and epistemological challenges related to the application of mixed methods in political science. There are important philosophical and empirical disagreements regarding the methodologies involved. On one side, philosophical challenges relate to the acceptance of a Pragmatic approach and, on the other, empirical issues arise with the technical plurality inherent to qualitative methods. It is argued that this double dimension distances the mixed methods of their intended goals.

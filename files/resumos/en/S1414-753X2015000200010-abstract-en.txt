In this article, the authors present the general aspects of Ulrich Beck's theory of the world risk society and formulate a critical assessment. Once presented the theoretical axis, defined as modernization-risk-reflexivity, and the experimental and transdisciplinary methodological foundation of sociology on cosmopolitanism, the authors highlight the contributions, some shortcomings and reflect on the challenges which, subsequent to Beck's sudden death, still remain with regard to Environment and Society studies. In order to do so, we present a brief historical reconstruction of his theory and point out to some of the directions taken by researchers in various fields. We also lay down some well-established criticisms and our own considerations.

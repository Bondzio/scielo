Abstract In this article, we aimed at thinking the complementary relation between political theory and social research. To achieve our objective, firstly we specified the reconstructive method&#8217;s potential and limits on political theory and how could it overcome the empirical and normative political theories dichotomy, and, on the other side, we indicated an open constitution of political concepts based on historical and social contexts. Later, we highlighted these concepts social genesis by analyzing the theory of recognition and empirical social researches that have helped the renewal and upgrade of these foundations.

Abstract Studies that analyze the travel accounts written by women in the nineteenth century generally try to outline specific aspects in those sources by demonstrating the personal views of the authors. This article reflects on this issue and attempts to demonstrate that if this trait is accepted as a trend then it is also possible to identify counter arguments that make such a simplistic distinction between &#8220;female&#8221; and &#8220;male&#8221; accounts more problematic than previously asserted. The primary sources for this research were the accounts of Latin American women who travelled to Europe and the United States in the nineteenth century.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Most natural    resource systems used by multiple individuals can be classified as common-pool    resources. Common-pool resources generate finite quantities of resource units    and one person's use subtracts from the quantity of resource units available    to others (OSTROM, GARDNER &amp; WALKER, 1994). Most common-pool resources are    sufficiently large that multiple actors can simultaneously use the resource    system and efforts to exclude potential beneficiaries are costly. Examples of    common-pool resources include both natural and human-made systems including:    groundwater basins, irrigation systems, forests, grazing lands, mainframe computers,    government and corporate treasuries, and the Internet. Examples of the resource    units derived from common-pool resources include water, timber, fodder, computer-processing    units, information bits, and budget allocations (BLOMQUIST &amp; OSTROM, 1985).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">When the    resource units are highly valued and many actors benefit from appropriating    (harvesting) them for consumption, exchange, or as a factor in a production    process, the appropriations made by one individual are likely to create negative    externalities for others. Nonrenewable resources, such as oil, may be withdrawn    in an uncoordinated race that reduces the quantity of the resource units that    can be withdrawn and greatly increases the cost of appropriation. Renewable    resources, such as fisheries, may suffer from congestion within one time period    but may also be so overharvested that the stock generating a flow of resource    units is destroyed. An unregulated, open-access common-pool resource generating    highly valued resource units is likely to be overused and may even be destroyed    if overuse destroys the stock or the facility generating the t1ow of resource    units.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Conventional    Theory of Common-Pool Resources</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Since the    important early studies of open-access fisheries by Gordon (1954) and Scott    (1955), most theoretical studies by political-economists have analyzed simple    common-pool resource systems using relatively similar assumptions (FEENY, HANNA    &amp; McEVOY, 1996). In such systems, it is assumed that the resource generates    a highly predictable, finite supply of one type of resource unit - one species,    for example - in each relevant time period. Appropriators are assumed to be    homogenous in terms of their assets, skills, discount rates, and cultural views.    They are also assumed to be short-term, profit-maximizing actors who possess    complete information. In this theory , <i>anyone</i> can enter the resource    and appropriate resource units. Appropriators gain property rights only to what    they harvest, which they then sell in an open competitive market. The open access    condition is a given. The appropriators make no effort to change it. Appropriators    act independently and do not communicate or coordinate their activities in any    way.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">"In this      setting, as the incisive analysis of Gordon and Scott demonstrates, each fisherman      will take into account only his own marginal costs and revenues and ignores      the fact that increases in his catch affect the returns to fishing effort      for other fishermen as well as the health of future fish stocks. [...] [E]conomic      rent is dissipated; economic overfishing, which may also lead to ecological      overfishing, is the result." (FEENY, HANNA &amp; McEVOY, 1996: 189)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Many textbooks    in resource economics and law and economics present this conventional theory    of a simple common-pool resource as the only theory needed for understanding    common-pool resources more generally (for a different approach, see BALAND &amp;    PLATTEAU, 1996). With the growing use of game theory, appropriation from common-pool    resources is frequently represented as a one-shot or finitely repeated, Prisoner's    Dilemma game (DAWES, 1973; DASGUPTA &amp; HEAL, 1979). These models formalize    the problem differently. but do not change any of the basic theoretical assumptions    about the finite and predictable supply of resource units, complete information,    homogeneity of users, their maximization of expected profits, and their lack    of interaction with one another or capacity to change their institutions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A sufficient    number of empirical examples have existed where the absence of property rights    and the independence of actors captures the essence of the problem facing appropriators    that the broad empirical applicability of the theory was not challenged until    the mid-1980s. The massive deforestation in tropical countries and the collapse    of the California sardine fishery and other ocean fisheries confirmed the worst    predictions to be derived from this theory for many scholars. Garrett Hardin's    (1968) dramatic article in <i>Science</i> convinced many nonecol1omists that    this theory captures the essence of the problem facing most common-pool resources    in the world. Since appropriators are viewed as being trapped in these dilemmas,    repeated recommendations were made that external authorities must impose a different    set of institutions on such settings. Some recommend private property as the    most efficient form of ownership (DEMSETZ, 1967; POSNER, 1977; SIMMONS, SMITH    &amp; GEORGIA, 1996). Others recommend government ownership and control (OPHULS,    1973). Implicitly, theorists assume that regulators will act in the public interest    and understand how ecological systems work and how to change institutions so    as to induce socially optimal behavior (FEENY, HANNA &amp; McEVOY, 1996: 195).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Until recently,    the possibility that the appropriators themselves would find ways to organize    themselves has not been seriously considered in much of the economics literature.    Organizing so as to create rules that specify rights and duties of participants    creates a public good for those involved. Anyone who is included in the community    of users benefits from this public good, whether they contribute or not. Thus,    getting "out of the trap" is itself a second-level dilemma. Further, investing    in monitoring and sanctioning activities so as to increase the likelihood that    participants follow the agreements they have made, also generates a public good.    Thus, these investments represent a third-level dilemma. Since much of the initial    problem exists because the individuals are stuck in a setting where they generate    negative externalities on one another, it is not consistent with the conventional    theory that they solve a second- and third-level dilemma in order to address    the first-level dilemma under analysis.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Until the    work of the National Academy of Sciences. Panel on Common Property (National    Research Council 1986), however, the basic theory discussed above was applied    to all common-pool resources regardless of the capacity of appropriators to    communicate and coordinate their activities. The growing evidence from many    studies of common-pool resources in the field called for a serious re-thinking    of the theoretical foundations for the analysis of common-pool resources (BERKES,    1986; 1989; BERKES et al. 1989; BROMLEY et al. 1992; McCAY &amp; ACHESON, 1987).    The consequence of these empirical studies is not to challenge the empirical    validity of the conventional theory where it is relevant but rather its generalizability.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>SELF-ORGANIZED    RESOURCE GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS IN THE FIELD</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Most common-pool    resources are more complex than the base theory of homogeneous appropriators    taking one type of resource unit from a resource system that generates a predictable    flow of units. The rich case-study literature illustrates a wide diversity of    settings in which appropriators dependant upon common-pool resources have organized    themselves to achieve much higher outcomes than is predicted by the conventional    theory (CORDELL, 1989; WADE, 1994; RUDDLE &amp; JOHANNES, 1985; SENGUPTA, 1991).<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Small- to    medium-sized irrigation systems come closer than many biological resources to    approximating these conditions and are, thus, an appropriate setting in which    to examine these patterns of relationships quantitatively. One resource unit    - water - is the focus of efforts to organize and coordinate activities. Recent    research on small- to medium-sized irrigation systems in Nepal has found a very    substantial difference in performance between those systems owned and governed    by the farmers themselves as contrasted to those systems owned and operated    (but in some cases, not governed) by a national governmenta1 agency.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">While most    farmers own land in Nepal, most own very small parcels of less than 1 hectare.    They are relatively homogeneous with similar preferences in regard to obtaining    water for rice production during the monsoon and winter seasons and various    crops during the spring. Farmers in Nepal have long had the authority to create    their own water associations, construct and maintain their own systems, and    monitor and enforce conformance to their rules (BENJAMIN et al. 1994; LAM, LEE    &amp; OSTROM, 1997). The irrigation systems constructed and maintained by farmers    tend to rely on low-tech construction techniques including building nonpermanent    headworks from mud. trees. and stones. International aid agencies have provided    considerable funding to government agencies in an effort to upgrade the engineering    standards.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In a detailed    analysis of data from 150 farmer-governed and national government irrigation    systems in Nepal, Lam (1998) develops three performance measures: ( 1) the physical    condition of irrigation systems; (2) the quantity of water available to farmers    at different seasons of the year; (3) the agricultural productivity of the systems.    Using multiple regression analysis techniques so as to control for environmental    differences among systems. Lam finds several variables strongly related to these    dependent variables. One is the form of governance of the system. Holding other    variables constant, irrigation systems governed by the farmers themselves perform    significantly better on all three performance measures. This variable has the    largest explanatory power of any variable in Lam's analysis, including the physical    size of the system, terrain characteristics, and the number of farmers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, farmers    with long-term ownership claims, who can communicate, develop their own agreements,    establish the positions of monitors, and sanction those who do not conform to    their own rules, are more likely to grow more rice, distribute water more equitably,    and keep their systems in better repair than is done on government systems.    While there is variance in the performance of these Nepali systems, and also    among the 47 farmer- governed systems in the Philippines described by de los    Reyes ( 1980), few perform as poorly as government systems holding other relevant    variables constant. Since many of the government systems rely on high-tech engineering,    the capability of farmers to increase agricultural production on their "primitive    systems" while they also provide the labor to maintain and operate the system,    is particularly noteworthy.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ON THE    ORIGIN OF SELF-GOVERNED COMMON-POOL RESOURCES</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Evidence    from field research thus challenges the generalizability of the conventional    theory. While it is generally successful in predicting outcomes in settings    where appropriators are alienated from one another or cannot communicate effectively,    it does not provide an explanation for settings where appropriators are able    to create and sustain agreements to avoid serious problems of over-appropriation.    Nor does it predict well when government ownership will perform appropriately    or how privatization will improve outcomes. A fully articulated, reformulated    theory encompassing the conventional theory as a special case does not yet exist.    On the other hand, scholars familiar with the results of field research substantially    agree on a set of variables that enhance the likelihood of appropriators organizing    themselves to avoid the social losses associated with open-access. common- pool    resources (McKEAN, 1992, 1998; WADE, 1994; SCHLAGER, 1990; TANG, 1992; OSTROM,    1990, 1992a, 1992b; BALAND &amp; PLATTEAU, 1996; OSTROM, GARDNER &amp; WALKER,    1994). Drawing heavily on E. Ostrom (1992b: 298f.) and Baland and Platteau (1996:    286-289), considerable consensus exists that the following attributes of resources    and of appropriators are conducive to an increased likelihood that self-governing    associations will form.</font></p>     ]]></body>

Feasible    improvement: Resource conditions are not at a point of deterioration such that    it is useless to organize or so underutilized that little advantage results    from organizing.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">R2. Indicators:    Reliable and valid indicators of the condition of the resource system are frequently    available at a relatively low cost.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">R3. Predictability:    The flow of resource units is relatively predictable.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">R4.

Low    Discount rate: Appropriators use a sufficiently low discount rate in relation    to future benefits to be achieved from the resource.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A4. Trust    and Reciprocity: Appropriators trust one another to keep promises and relate    to one another with reciprocity.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A5. Autonomy:    Appropriators are able to determine access and harvesting rules without external    authorities countermanding them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A6. Prior    organizational experience and local leadership: Appropriators have learned at    least minimal skills of organization and leadership through participation in    other local associations or learning about ways that neighboring groups have    organized.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It is very    important to stress that many of these variables are in turn affected by the    type of larger regime in which users are embedded. Larger regimes can facilitate    local self-organization by providing accurate information about natural resource    systems, providing arenas in which participants can engage in discovery and    conflict-resolution processes, and providing mechanisms to back up local monitoring    and sanctioning efforts. The probability of participants adapting more effective    rules in macro-regimes that facilitate their efforts over time is higher than    in regimes that ignore resource problems entirely or, at the other extreme,    presume that all decisions about governance and management need to be made by    central authorities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The key    to further theoretical integration is to understand how these attributes interact    in complex ways to affect the basic benefit-cost calculations of a set of appropriators    (A) using a resource (OSTROM, 1990: Ch. 6). Each appropriator i (iE A) has to    compare the expected net benefits of harvesting continuing to use the old rules    (BO) to the benefits he or she expects to achieve with a new set of rules (BN).    Each appropriator i must ask whether his or her incentive to change (Di ) is    positive or negative.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Di= BNi-    Boi</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">If Di is    negative for all appropriators, no one has an incentive to change. If Di is    positive for some appropriators, they then need to estimate three types of costs:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">C1: the    up-front costs of time and effort spent devising and agreeing upon new rules;</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">C2: the    short-term costs of adopting new appropriation strategies; and</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">C3: the    long-term costs of monitoring and maintaining a self-governed system over time.    If the sum of these expected costs for each appropriator exceeds the incentive    to change, no appropriator will invest the time and resources needed to create    new institutions.

Some may perceive positive benefits after all costs have    been taken into account, while others perceive net losses. Consequently, the    collective-choice rules used to change the day-to-day operational rules related    to appropriation, affects whether an institutional change favored by some and    opposed by others will occur. For any collective-choice rule, such as unanimity,    majority, ruling elite, or one-person rule, there is a minimum coalition of    appropriators, K c A, that must agree prior to the adoption of new rules. If    for any individual k, a member of K,</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Dk &lt;=    (C1k + C2k + C3k )</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">no new roles    will be adapted. And ir for at least one coalition KcA, it is such that</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Dk &gt;    ( C I k + C2k + C3k )</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">for all    members of K, it is feasible for a new set of rules to be adopted. If there    are several such coalitions, the question of which coalition will form, and    thus which rules will result, is a theoretical issue beyond the scope of this    chapter. This analysis is applicable to a situation where a group starts with    an open access set of rules and contemplates adopting its first set of rules    limiting access. It is also relevant to the continuing consideration of changing    operational rules over time.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The rule    used to change institutional arrangements in field settings varies from reliance    on the decisions made by one or a few leaders, to a formal reliance on majority    or super-majority vote, to reliance on consensus or close to unanimity. If there    are substantial differences in the perceived benefits and costs of appropriators,    it is possible that K appropriators will impose a new set of rules on the A-K    other appropriators that strongly favors those in the winning coalition and    imposes losses or lower benefits on those in the losing coalition (THOMPSON,    MANNIX &amp; BAZERMAN, 1988). If expected benefits from a change in institutional    arrangements are not greater than expected costs for many appropriators, however,    the costs of enforcing a change in institutions will be much higher than when    most participants expect to benefit from a change in rules over time. Where    the enforcement costs are full y borne by the members of K, operational rules    that benefit the A-K other appropriators lower the long-term costs of monitoring    and sanctioning for a governing coalition. Where external authorities enforce    the rules agreed upon by K appropriators, the distribution of costs and benefits    are more likely to benefit K and may impose costs on the A-K other appropriators    (WALKER et al., 1997).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The attributes    of a resource (listed above) affect both the benefits and costs of institutional    change. If resource units are relatively abundant (R1), there are few reasons    for appropriators to invest costly time and effort in organizing. If the resource    is already substantially destroyed, the high costs of organizing may not generate    substantial benefits. Thus, self -organization is likely to occur only after    appropriators observe substantial scarcity. The danger here, however, is that    exogenous shocks leading to a change in relative abundance of the resource units    occur rapidly and appropriators may not adapt quickly enough to the new circumstances    (LIBECAP &amp; WIGGINS, 1985).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The presence    of frequently available, reliable indicators about the conditions of a resource    (R2) affects the capacity of appropriators to adapt relatively soon to changes    that could adversely affect their long-term benefit stream (MOXNES, 1996). A    resource flow that is highly predictable (R3) is much easier to understand and    manage than one that is erratic. In the latter case, it is always difficult    for appropriators - or, for that matter, for scientists and government officials    - to judge whether changes in the resource stock or flow are due to overharvesting    or to random exogenous variables (FEENY, HANNA &amp; McEVOY, 1996 for a discussion    of these issues related to the collapse of the California sardine industry).    Unpredictability of resource units in micro-settings, such as private pastures,    may lead appropriators to create a larger common-property unit to increase the    predictability of resource availability somewhere in the larger unit (NETTING,    1972; WILSON &amp; THOMPSON, 1993). The spatial extent of a resource (R4) affects    the costs of defining reasonable boundaries and then of monitoring them over    time.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The attributes    of the appropriators themselves also affect their expected benefits and costs.    If appropriators do not obtain a major part of their in- come from a resource    (A1). the high costs of organizing and maintaining a self-governing system may    not be worth their effort. If appropriators do not share a common understanding    of how complex resource systems operate (A2), they will find it extremely difficult    to agree on future joint strategies. As Libecap and Wiggins <i>(1985)</i> argue    asymmetric private information about heterogeneous assets, may adversely affect    the willingness of participants to agree to a reduction in their use patterns    before considerable damage is done to a resource. Given the complexity of many    common-pool resources - especially multi-species or multi-product resources    - understanding how these systems work may be counterintuitive even for those    who make daily contacts with the resource. In resources that are highly variable    (R3), it may be particularly difficult to understand and to sort out those out-comes    stemming from exogenous factors and those resulting from the actions of appropriators.    And as Brander and Taylor ( 1998) have argued, when the resource base itself    grows very slowly, population growth may exceed the carrying capacity before    participants have achieved a common understanding of the problem they face.    Of course, this is also a problem facing officials as well as appropriators.    Appropriators with many other viable and attractive options, who thus discount    the importance of future income from a particular resource (A3), may prefer    to "mine" one resource without spending resources to regulate it. They simply    move on to other resources once this one is destroyed, assuming there will always    be other resources available to them.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Appropriators    who trust one another (A4) to keep agreements and use reciprocity in their relationships    with one another face lower expected costs involved in monitoring and sanctioning    one another over lime. Appropriators who lack trust at the beginning of a process    of organizing may be able to build this form of social capital (COLEMAN, 1988;    OSTROM, 1992a) if they initially adopt small changes that most appropriators    follow before trying to make major institutional changes. Autonomy (A5) tends    to lower the costs of organizing. A group that has little autonomy may find    that those who disagree with locally developed rules seek contacts with higher-level    officials to undo the efforts of appropriators to achieve regulation<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>.    With the legal autonomy to make their own rules, appropriators face substantially    lower costs in defending their own rules against other authorities. Prior experience    with other forms of local organization (A6) greatly enhances the repertoire    of rules and strategies known by local participants as potentially useful to    achieve various forms of regulation. Further, appropriators are more likely    to agree upon rules whose operation they understand from prior experience, than    upon rules that are introduced by external actors and are new to their experience.    Given the complexity of many field settings, appropriators face a difficult    task in evaluating how diverse variables affect expected benefits and costs    over a long time horizon. In many cases, it is just as difficult, if not more    so, for scientists to make a valid and reliable estimate of total benefits and    costs arid their distribution.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Appropriators    in the field rarely face a setting that generates clear-cut benefit-cost ratios    and the collective choice rules in some settings give a small elite substantial    power to block suggested changes that may generate overall positive gains but    some losses for those in power. Consequently, the growing theoretical consensus    does <i>not</i> lead to a conclusion that most appropriators using common-pool    resources will undertake self-governed regulation. Many settings exist where    the theoretical expectation should be the opposite: Appropriators will overuse    the resource unless efforts are made to change one or more of the variables    affecting perceived costs or benefits. Given the number of variables that affect    these costs and benefits, many points of external intervention can enhance or    reduce the probability of appropriators' agreeing upon and following rules that    generate higher social returns. But both social scientists and policymakers    have a lot to learn about how these variables operate interactively in field    settings and even how to measure them so as to increase the empirical warrantability    of the growing theoretical consensus.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Many aspects    of the macro-institutional structure surrounding a particular setting affect    the perceived costs and benefits. Thus, external authorities can do a lot to    enhance the likelihood and performance of self –governing institutions. Their    actions can also seriously impede these developments as well. Further, when    the activities of one set of appropriators, A, have "spillover effects" on others    beyond A, external authorities can either facilitate processes that allow multiple    groups to solve conflicts arising from negative spillovers or take a more active    role in governing particular resources themselves.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers    and public officials need to recognize the multiple manifestation of these theoretical    variables in the field. Appropriators may be highly dependant on a resource    (A1), for example, because they are in a remote location and few roads exist    to enable them to leave. Alternatively, they may be located in a central location,    but other opportunities are not open to them due to lack of training or a discriminatory    labor market. Appropriators discount rates (A3) in relation to a particular    resource may be low because they have lived for a long time in a particular    location and expect that they and their grandchildren will remain in that location,    or because they possess a secure and well-defined bundle of property rights    to this resource (SCHLAGER &amp; OSTROM, 1992). Reliable indicators of the condition    of a resource (R2) may result from activities that the appropriators themselves    do- such as regularly shearing the wool from sheep (GILLES &amp; JAMTGAARD,    1981) or because of efforts to gather reliable information by appropriators    or by external authorities (BLOMQUIST, 1992). Predictability of resource units    (R3) may result from a clear regularity in the natural environment of the resource    or because storage has been constructed in order to even out the flow of resource    units over both good and bad years. They may have autonomy to make their own    rules (A5) because a national government is weak and unable to exert authority    over resources that it formally owns, or be- cause national1aw formally legitimates    self-governance - as is the case with Japanese inshore fisheries.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">When the    benefits of organizing are commonly understood by participants to be very high,    appropriators lacking many of the attributes conducive to the development of    seIf-governing institutions may be able to overcome their liabilities and stil1    develop effective agreements. The crucial factor is not whether all attributes    are favorable but the relative size of the expected benefits and costs they    generate as perceived by participants. All of these variables affect the expected    benefits and costs of appropriators. It is difficult, however, particularly    for outsiders to estimate their impact on expected benefits and costs given    the difficulty of making precise measures of these variables and weighing them    on a cumulative scale. Further empirical analysis of these theoretical propositions    is dependant on the conduct of careful comparative over-time studies of a sufficiently    large number of field settings using a common set of measurement protocols (OSTROM,    1998).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>ON THE    DESIGN PRINCIPLES OF ROBUST, SELF-GOVERNED COMMON-POOL RESOURCE INSTITUTIONS</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Of course,    the performance of self-governed common-pool resource systems varies across    systems and time. Some self-governed common-pool resource systems have survived    and flourished for centuries, while others falter and fail. As discussed above,    some never get organized in the first place. In addition to the consensus concerning    the theoretical variables conducive to self-organization, considerable agreement    also exists about the characteristics of those self-governing systems that are    robust in the sense that they survive for very long periods of lime utilizing    the same basic rules for adapting to new situations over time (SHEPSLE, 1989).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The particular    rules used in the long-surviving, self-governing systems varied substantially    from one another. Consequently, it is not possib1e to arrive at empirical generalizations    about the particular types of rules used to define who is a member of a self-governing    community, what rights they have to access a common-poo1 resource and appropriate    resource units, and what particular obligations they face. It is possible, however,    to derive a series of design principles that characterize the configuration    of rules that are used. By design principles, I mean an "element or condition    that helps to account for the success of these institutions in sustaining the    [common-pool resource] and gaining the compliance of generation after generation    of appropriators to the rules in use" (OSTROM, 1990: 90). Robust, long-term    institutions are characterized by most of the design principles listed in <a href="#tabela1">Table    I</a>. The farmer-owned irrigation systems in Nepal analyzed by Benjamin et    al. ( 1994) and Lam ( 1998), for example, are characterized by most of these    design principles. Fragile institutions tend to be characterized by only some    of these design principles. Failed institutions are characterized by very few    of these principles (SCHWEIK, ADHIKARI &amp; PANDIT, 1997; MORROW &amp; HULL,    1996; BLOMQUIST, 1996).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p align="center"><a name="tabela1"></a></p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/n10/16883t1.gif"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">These principles    work to enhance the shared understanding of participants of the structure of    the resource and its appropriators and of the benefits and costs involved in    following a set of agreed-upon rules. Design Principle 1 - having rules that    clearly define who has rights to use a resource and the boundaries of that resource    - ensures that appropriators can clearly identify anyone who does not have rights    and take action against them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Design Principle    2 involves two pans. The first is a congruence between the rules that assign    benefits and the rules that assign costs. The crucial thing here is that these    rules be considered fair and legitimate by the participants themselves (McKEAN,    1992). In many settings, fair rules are those that keep a relative proportionate    relationship between the assignment of benefits and of costs. In irrigation    systems, for example, rules that allocate water to different farmers according    to the amount of land they own as well as allocating duties for costs of operation    and maintenance using the same formula, are usually considered by farmers to    be fair (as well as effective from an agricultural perspective). The second    part of this design principle is that both types of rules be well-matched to    local conditions such as soils, slope, number of diversions, crops being grown,    etc.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Design Principle    3 is concerned with the collective-choice arrangements used to modify the operational    rules of regular operation of the resource. If most appropriators are not involved    in modifying these rules over time, the information about the benefits and costs    as perceived by different participants is not fully taken into account in these    efforts to adapt to new conditions and information over time. Appropriators    who begin to perceive the costs of their system being higher than their benefits    and who are prevented from making serious proposals for change, may simply begin    to cheat whenever they have the opportunity. Once cheating on rules becomes    more frequent for some appropriators, others will follow suit. In this case,    enforcement costs become very high or the system fails.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">No matter    how high the level of agreement to an initial agreement is, there are always    conditions that tempt some individuals to cheat (even when they perceive the    overall benefits of the system to be higher than the costs). If one person is    able to cheat while others conform to the rules, the cheater is usually able    to gain substantially to the disadvantage of others. Thus, without monitoring    of rule conformance - Design Principle 4 - few systems are able to survive very    long at all. The sanctions that are used, however, do not need to be extremely    high in the first instance. The important thing about a sanction for an appropriator    who has succumbed to temptation is that their action is noticed and that a punishment    is meted out. This tells all appropriators that cheating on rules is noticed    and punished without making all rule infractions into major criminal events.    If the sanctions are graduated (Design Principle 5). however, an appropriator    who breaks rules repeatedly and who is noticed doing <i>so,</i> eventually faces    a penalty that makes rule breaking an unattractive option. While rules are always    assumed to be clear and unambiguous in theoretical work, this is rarely the    case in field settings. It is easy to have a disagreement about how to interpret    a rule that limits appropriation activities or requires input resources. If    these disagreements are not resolved in a low-cost and orderly manner, then    appropriators may lose their willingness to conform to rules because of the    ways that "others" interpret them in their own favor (Design Principle 6).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Design Principles    7 and 8 are related to autonomy. When the rights of a group to devise their    own institutions are recognized by national, regional, and local governments,    the legitimacy of the rules crafted by appropriators will be less frequently    challenged in courts, administrative and legislative settings. Further, in larger    resources with many participants, nested enterprises that range in size from    small to large enable participants to solve diverse problems involving different    scale economies. By utilizing base institutions that are quite small, face-to-face    communication can be utilized for solving many of the day-to-day problems in    smaller groups. By nesting each level of organization in a larger level. externalities    from one group to others can be addressed in larger organizational settings    that have a legitimate role to play in relationship to the smaller entities.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>THEORETICAL    PUZZLES</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In addition    to the consensus concerning the variables most likely to enhance self-organization    and the design principles characterizing successful, long-term governance arrangements,    many unresolved theoretical issues still exist about the self-governance of    common-pool resources. Two major theoretical questions relate to the effect    of size and heterogeneity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Size</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The effect    of the number of participants facing problems of creating and sustaining a self-governing    enterprise is unclear. Drawing on the early work of Mancur Olson (1965), many    theorists argue that size of group is negatively related to solving collectiye-action    problems in general (also BUCHANAN &amp; TULLOCK, 1962). Many results from game    theoretical analysis of repeated games conclude that cooperative strategies    are more likely to emerge and be sustained in smaller rather than larger groups    (synthesis of this literature in BALAND &amp; PLATTEAU, 1996). Scholars who    have studied many self-organized irrigation and forestry institutions in the    field have concluded that success will more likely happen in smaller groups    (BARKER et al., 1984; CERNEA, 1989).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">On the other    hand, most of the 37 farmer-governed irrigation systems studied by Tang were    relatively small, ranging in size from 7 to 300 appropriators. Tang did not    find any statistical relationship within that size range between the number    of appropriators or the amount of land being irrigated and performance variables    (1992: 68). In Lam's multiple regression analysis of the performance of a much    larger set of irrigation systems in Nepal ranging in size up to 475 irrigators,    however, he did not find any significant relationship between either the number    of appropriators or the amount of land included in the service area with any    of the three performance variables he studied ( 1998: 115). Further, in a systematic    study of forest institutions, Agrawal (1998) has not found smal1er forest user    groups as able to undertake the level of monitoring needed to protect forest    resources as moderately sized groups.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One of the    problems with a focus on size of group as a key determining factor is that many    other variables change as group size increases (CHAMBERLIN, 1974; HARDIN, 1982).    If the costs of providing a public good related to the use of a common-pool    resource, say a sanctioning system, remain relatively constant as group size    increases, then increasing the number of participants brings additional resources    that could be drawn upon to provide the benefit enjoyed by all (see ISAAC, WALKER    &amp; WILLIAMS, 1993). Marwell &amp; Oliver ( 1993: 45) conclude that when a    ..good has pure jointness of supply, group size has a <i>positive</i> effect    on the probability that it will be provided". On the other hand, if one is analyzing    the conflict levels over a subtractable good and the transaction costs of arriving    at acceptable allocation formulas, group size may well exacerbate the problems    of self-governing systems. Since there are tradeoffs among various impacts of    size on other variables, a better working hypothesis is that group size has    a curvilinear relationship to performance.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Heterogeneity</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Many scholars    conclude that only very small groups can organize themselves effectively because    they presume that size is related to the homogeneity of a group and that homogeneity    is needed to initiate and sustain self-governance. Heterogeneity is also a highly    contested variable. For one thing, groups can differ along a diversity of dimensions    including their cultural backgrounds, interests, and endowments (BALAND &amp;    PLATTEAU, 1996). Each may operate differently.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">If groups    coming from diverse cultural backgrounds share access to a common resource,    the key question affecting the likelihood of self-organized solutions is whether    the views of the multiple groups concerning the structure of the resource, authority,    interpretation of rules, trust, and reciprocity differ or are similar. In other    words, do they share a common understanding (A2) of their situation? New settlers    to a region may simply learn and accept the rules of the established group,    and their cultural differences on other fronts do not affect their participation    in governing a re- source. On the other hand, new settlers are frequently highly    disruptive to the sustenance of a self-governing enterprise when they generate    higher levels of conflict over the interpretation and application of rules and    increase enforcement costs substantially.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">When the    interests of appropriators differ, achieving a self-governing solution to common-pool    resource problems is particularly challenging.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Appropriators    who possess more substantial economic and political assets may have similar    interests to those with fewer assets or they may differ substantially on multiple    attributes. When the more powerful have similar interests, they may greatly    enhance the probability of successful organization if they invest their resources    in organizing a group and devising rules to govern that group. Those with substantial    economic and political assets are more likely to be a member of K and thus have    a bigger impact on decisions about institutional changes. Mancur Olson ( 1965)    long ago recognized the possibility of a privileged group whereby some were    sufficiently affected to bear a disproportionate share of the costs of organizing    to provide public goods (such as the organization of a collectivity). On the    other hand, if those with more assets also have low discount rates (A3) related    to a particular resource and lower salience (A1), they may simply be unwilling    to expend inputs or actually impede organizational efforts that might lead to    their having to cut back on their productive activities.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This problem    characterizes some fisheries where local subsistence fish- ermen have strong    interests in the sustenance of an inshore fishery, while industrial fishing    firms have many other options and may be more interested in the profitability    of fishing in a particular location than its sustained yield. The conflict between    absentee livestock owners versus local pastoralists has also proved difficult    to solve in many parts of the world.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Differential    endowments of appropriators can be associated with both extreme levels of conflict    as well as very smooth and low-cost transitions into a sustainable, self-governed    system. Johnson and Libecap ( 1982) reason that the difference in the skills    and knowledge of different kinds of fishers frequently prevents them from arriving    at agreements about how to allocate quantitative harvesting quotas (also SCOTT,    1993). In this case, heterogeneity of endowments and of interests coincide.    Heterogeneity of wealth or power may or may not be associated with a difference    in interests. As discussed above, when those who have more assets share similar    interests with those who have less assets, groups may be privileged by having    the more powerful take on the higher initial costs of organizing while crafting    rules that benefit a large proportion of the appropriators. Appropriators may    design institutions that cope effectively with heterogeneities. Thus, when they    adopt rules that allocate benefits using the same formulae used to allocate    duties and responsibilities (Design Principle 2A), appropriators who differ    significantly in terms of assets will tend to agree to and follow such rules.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Even in    a group that differs on many variables, if at least a minimally winning subset    of K appropriators harvesting an endangered but valuable resource are dependant    on it (A1), share a common understanding of their situations (A2), have a low    discount rate (A3), trust one another (A4), and have autonomy to make their    own rules (A5), it is more likely that they will estimate the expected benefits    of governing their resource greater than the expected costs. Whether the rules    agreed upon distribute benefits and costs fairly depends both on the collective-choice    rule used and the type of heterogeneity existing in the community. Neither size    nor heterogeneity are variables with a uniform effect on the likelihood of organizing    and sustaining self-governing enterprises. The debate about their effect is    focusing on the wrong variables. Instead of focusing on size or the various    kinds of heterogeneity by themselves, it is important to ask how these variables    affect other variables as they impact on the benefit-cost calculus of those    involved in negotiating and sustaining agreements. Their impact on costs of    producing and distributing information (SCOTT, 1993) is particularly important.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>CONCLUSION</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The conventional    theory of common-pool resources, which presumed that external authorities were    needed to impose new rules on those appropriators trapped into producing excessive    externalities on themselves and others, has now been shown to be a special theory    of a more general theoretical structure. For appropriators to reformulating    the institutions they face, they have to conclude that the expected benefits    from an institutional change will exceed the immediate and long-term expected    costs. When appropriators cannot communicate and have no way of gaining trust    through their own efforts or with the help of the macro-institutional system    within which they are embedded, the prediction of the earlier theory is likely    to be empirically supported. Ocean fisheries, the stratosphere, and other global    commons come closest to the appropriate empirical referents. If appropriators    can engage in face-to-face bargaining and have autonomy to change their rules,    they may well attempt to organize themselves. Whether they organize depends    on attributes of the resource system and the appropriators themselves that affect    the benefits to be achieved and the costs of achieving them. Whether their self-governed    enterprise succeeds over the long-term depends on whether the institutions they    design are consistent with design principles underlying robust, long-living,    self-governed systems. The theory of common-pool resources has progressed substantially    during the past half century. There are, however, many challenging puzzles to    be solved.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers    interested in these questions need to continue undertaking case studies which    enable one to understand the complex interactions that occur within a particular    setting. Case studies that follow developments over a long-period of time and    those that study failed efforts to change are particularly important. More experiment    research also allows us to examine the impact of one variable while controlling    other variables in a simple setting. We also need many more large N studies    to test the relative importance of different variables. Getting a better empirical    foundation for which variables consistently are associated with a higher level    of success is important for theory development and policy analysis. Most important    are over-time studies that enable us to understand the dynamics of these systems.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Policy-makers    can already take some of the important finds and use them immediately. A consistent    finding is that having a supportive legal structure at the macro-level that    authorizes users to take responsibility for self- organizing and crafting at    least some of their own rules. Constructing more conducive legal structures    is justified on the basis of current evidence. In addition to the local units    that users may self-organize, it is also important for policy makers to create    large-scale agencies who monitor performance of both natural resource systems    and those that are using them and compile accurate information that is available    to users to increase their knowledge. Further, having low-cost courts and other    conflict resolution mechanisms allows debilitating conflicts to get resolved    sooner and lower cost for every- one. And, finally, trying to develop programs    whereby users gain more benefits from local resources changes the benefit-cost    calculus that they bring and increases the likelihood of self-organization.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Resource    users also face a challenge. They need to be creating association where they    can share with one another information about their own successes and failures.    They need to search for ways of increasing the benefit flow to be derived from    a sustainable use of local resources. It is also important to find ways of decreasing    monitoring and sanctioning costs by involving users in the choice of regulations    so that these are perceived to be legitimate. And, to do both of these, it is    essential to draw on cultural endowments and their knowledge of local resources    to find innovative institutions that fit local conditions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, there    is a lot for all of us to do.</font></p>     ]]></body>

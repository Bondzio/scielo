The object of this article is the qualified-specialized characteristic of immigrant work related to the legalized circuit of immigration. The references and the different theoretical backgrounds are evaluated highlighting the relevance of the &#8220;global market for qualified human resources&#8221;. The manifestation of these fluxes in Brazil (2007-2014) is analyzed based on the statistics of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labor and Employment about the visa regime, the composition of gender and nationality. A section is dedicated to &#8220;global maritimes&#8221;, and Cuban doctors, because they represent an emblematic case in the new sociohistorical bases of development of the immigration phenomenon in the country. Finally, a balance will be made about the link between these issues and the movements of labor precariousness, in particular those regarding temporality and flexibility.

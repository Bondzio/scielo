To build the design of the Legal Status of Water in Brazil, international and national legal standards that address directly or indirectly the waters were researched and analyzed, focusing on the identification of the following elements: i) degree of formal and legal recognition of water as a fundamental human right in Brazil and in international law; ii) constitutional regime of the waters in Brazil; iii) legal status of the waters in domestic law and; iv) legal guarantees to protect the right to water. The research, qualitative, was held in the official pages of the Brazilian government and the United Nations, and the selected laws were those presenting content relevant to the theoretical construction of the Legal Status of Water in Brazil.

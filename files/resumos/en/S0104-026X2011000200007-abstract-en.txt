In this paper, the concept of gender is presented and discussed in its relations with the idea of performativity, according the reflexions made by Judith Butler. If gender is considered as an analytical tool in the field of pedagogical studies, we can discuss this concept giving attention to the ways in which gender is constructed by cultural pedagogies. This discussion intends to contribute to the discussion of naturalized ideas of gender and sexuality, underlining the importance of the performative process that constitutes gender, body and heterossexuality as cultural constructs marked by historicity.

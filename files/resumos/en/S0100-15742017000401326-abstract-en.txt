ABSTRACT In this article, we describe a methodological approach to the teaching of reading and writing in the classroom. The study was based on work with text genres from the perspective of retextualization which, generally speaking, is characterized by rewriting an oral or written text under other conditions of production (with different ideologies and values, different enunciators and enunciatees, in another language, in another genre, in another means of disclosure, etc.). To this end, we decided to describe work developed in a fifth-grade class at a public school in the city of Cataguases, state of Minas Gerais, in order to discuss and reflect on a pedagogical action mediating and problematizing school contents.

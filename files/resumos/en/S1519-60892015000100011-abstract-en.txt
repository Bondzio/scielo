Abstract: Although recent in Brazil, studies on criminal justice flow have become more frequent. Thus, the number of studies that examine ways and dynamic of the criminal justice system (SJC) processing the criminal activities increased significantly in the last decade. Some studies have analyzed the main obstacles between criminal activities and judicial sentences, while others focused on the duration of the processes in the criminal justice system. Despite the variety of sources and methodologies, these studies in general have examined the functioning of the Brazilian criminal justice system under the perspective of its efficiency. That is, they evaluated the system&#8217;s ability to properly process the entire demand for punishment. Little has been discussed about the effectiveness of punishment, its causes and effects. In this article, we discuss the low effectiveness of the criminal justice system on the base of the analysis of homicides justice flow in the Brazilian Federal District.

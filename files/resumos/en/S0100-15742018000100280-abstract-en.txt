ABSTRACT: Reflecting about the educational phenomena is not a novelty in the Brazilian context. However, the empowerment and institutionalization processes of a specific space to think, investigate and train new staff in the strict context of education gain materiality in the first half of the twentieth century and influence the gradual increase of importance of the area. In order to understand the relationships between the aspirations of the doctoral students in the area of Education in Brazil and the development of this area of knowledge, this article, through the analysis of 455 questionnaires answered by students, discusses Bourdieu&#8217;s influence on the correspondence between field and habitus. The study revealed the power of educational relations in the processes of constitution and sharing of a habitus of this academic space, as well as in the processes of reproduction of their cadres and of construction of doctoral students&#8217; aspirations.

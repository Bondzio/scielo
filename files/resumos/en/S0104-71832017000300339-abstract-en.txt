Abstract: Rio Grande do Sul is the southernmost state of Brazil and has the second highest percentage of white population of the country. There, the legacy of European immigrants is praised in contrast with the much lower social and symbolic visibility of the contribution of Blacks and Natives. The Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), the oldest, most traditional and important university of the state, has always been a stronghold of whiteness. From 2008 to 2012, it implemented an affirmative action policy that increased the opportunities for Blacks and Natives in its undergraduate courses. The first part of this article examines the discussion, approval, implementation, evaluation and reformulation of that policy, as well as its results in terms of access to the undergraduate courses. The second part analyses the experience of a group of black and native students, who were among the first to enter UFRGS through social and racially preferential admission. It, also, discusses challenges of Brazilian public universities in view of the affirmative action policies that are being implemented.

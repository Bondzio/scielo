Abstract: This paper analyses the process of building a discursive category: Traditional People and Communities of African Matrix. This is an expression used to name the Afro-Brazilian religions practitioners on the public policies of cultural diversity in Brazil. The aim of this paper is to think how the Afro-religious movement organizes and presents its agenda in this context. The analysis is based on the official documents produced by the federal government related to the affirmative action in Brazil from 2003 to 2014. It also intends to reflect how the federal government will continue those politics after President Ms. Dilma Rousseff&#8217;s impeachment.

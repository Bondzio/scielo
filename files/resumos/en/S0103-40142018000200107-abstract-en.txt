Abstract During 2012 and 2013, the author participated in a series of writing workshops on Creative Writing and Reading Mediation at the Romão Gomes Military Penal Institution in São Paulo, Brazil. In a partnership between SPLeituras and the National Foundation for Prisoner Protection (Funap), these workshops aimed at preparing new readers. This article presents an account of the work at these workshops, which greatly exceeded its initial aspirations and was supported mainly by the perception of literature as well as by the narration of one&#8217;s own story as a powerful mechanism for personal reorganization and for the discovery of new ways within the field of language.

ABSTRACT This article is about the presence of genetically modified organisms (gmos) in the south of Brazil in the past decades. The reconstitution of this history by three scenarios - discovery/production, entrance/dispersion, permanency - allows us to map the formation of chains of association that coproduce both, the definition of the transgenic agent and the group that represents it, among the existence of sociotechnical disputes, or as it can be named, controversies. These disputes, centered in these three events and their effects in the south of Brazil - discovery, dispersion and permanency of the transgenic crops -, return to sociology and to the actor-network theory the problem of the difference of scale added to the asymmetry of power relations.

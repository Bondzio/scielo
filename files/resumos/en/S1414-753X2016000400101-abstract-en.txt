abstract Is presents a methodology for ranking of municipalities from Rio de Janeiro for implementation payments for environmental services programs (PES). Variables were selected of Pesquisa de Informações Básicas Municipais from IBGE, grouping them into themes: Environmental Impacts, Institutional Apparatus and Environmental Actions. An index per theme was calculated and they were synthesized in the final index. Miracema and Nova Friburgo stood out with highest levels. Cambuci, Japeri, Areal, Magé, Comendador Levy Gasparian and Macuco stood out the lowest. The results show that the main environmental problem was the degradation of water resources, institutional apparatus is precarious and environmental actions were not directly relate to environmental impacts present. PES arrangement should consider payments made by the government, and the municipalities needs to improve yours institutional apparatus. The methodology used is easy to apply with potential for replication throughout Brazil and periodic update with each new edition of MUNIC.

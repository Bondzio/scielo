<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>1 <i>Introduction</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The challenges facing water management have become    increasingly global in scope since the 1970s. This reflects the rising awareness    about the uncertainties posed by the worsening situation of the hydrosphere,    and particularly freshwater, and the unsustainability of water management practices    in many areas. It is also a reflection of the conflicts flaring up from the    protracted social inequalities affecting the access to water for essential human    uses and from the inefficiency, ineffectiveness, and inefficacy characterizing    water management in many regions, not just in the poorer countries. In this    regard, since the 1970s the international community has launched significant    and far-reaching policy initiatives in response to the challenges. These include    tackling desertification, controlling water pollution, developing conflict prevention    measures in the light of ongoing and potential water conflicts, monitoring and    preventing water-related threats and hazards (ranging from the impact of floods    and other disastrous climatic events to the persistence, revival and emergence    of water-related diseases), to overcoming the deficiencies and inequalities    in the allocation and distribution of water for essential human use in developing    countries (for a synthesis of the main international initiatives since the 1970s,    see "MILESTONES 1972-2003: from Stockholm to Kyoto" at UNESCO’s Water    Portal, <a href="http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/milestones/index.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/milestones/index.shtml</a>).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, despite the important efforts made in    recent decades, there is a growing awareness that the struggle for reducing    ecological unsustainability and limiting the negative impact of water-related    hazards and deficiencies in water management is being lost in many countries.    As an example, let us consider the goal of guaranteeing universal access to    essential water and sanitation services, which continues to be a main target    of the international community. The goal of universalizing these services was    restated in the late 1970s, when the aspiration to provide essential volumes    of safe water to every human being on earth by 1990 was endorsed by the United    Nations. The 1977 UN Water Conference in Mar del Plata, Argentina, which led    to the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1980-1990),    declared that everyone has "the right to have access to drinking water    in quantities and of a quality equal to their basic needs". The Decade    was officially closed by the Global Consultation held in New Delhi in 1990,    which produced the New Delhi Statement calling for "some &#91;water&#93; for all    rather than more for some" (UNITED NATIONS, 1980; 1990). Unfortunately,    and although significant progress has been made in some areas, that goal was    not achieved. As a matter of fact, current estimates show that at the beginning    of the twentieth first century 1.1 billion people, around 17 per cent of the    world population, still lacks access to safe water while around 2.4 billion,    or 40 per cent, has no access to adequate sanitation (EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2002a,b).    Moreover, while the objectives for 1990 had been to guarantee universal access    to essential volumes of water, the current targets as expressed in the UN Millennium    Development Goals (MDGs) adopted in 2000-2002 are limited to halving the proportion    of the world population without access to these services by 2015 (UNITED NATIONS,    2000, 2002). Although from a certain perspective the new goals may be more "realistic",    in practice this means that the international community is prepared to accept    that a large proportion of human beings will continue to suffer disease and    death owing to the lack of essential water services perhaps for decades to come.    In this connection, a recent evaluation of the progress made in relation to    the MDGs shows that even these limited objectives will not be achieved in many    of the poorest countries, which are characterized by "fragile states &#91;…&#93;    with weak governance and institutions" (WHO, 2005, p. 27, 71).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is increasing recognition that, to a large    extent, the main causes for this unacceptable state of affairs are neither technical    nor "natural" but rather are, broadly speaking, of a social and political    nature. The water crisis, we are told, is mainly "a crisis of governance"    (UNESCO, 2006, p. 1). But, what does "governance" mean in this context?    Although the prevailing uses of this concept in the literature dedicated to    water seem to suggest a shared understanding of the meaning of governance, in    fact the answer to this question is not straightforward. For some, governance    is an instrument, a means to achieve certain ends, an administrative and technical    toolkit that can be used in different contexts to reach a given objective, such    as enforcing a particular water policy. For others, governance is a process    involving not the implementation of decisions taken by experts and powerholders,    but rather the debate of alternative, often rival projects of societal development,    and the definition of the ends and means that must be pursued by society, through    a process of substantive democratic participation. In addition to the contrasting    conceptions of governance discussed here, there are also different intellectual    and political traditions, some of them defending irreconcilable positions, which    inform dissimilar understandings and practices of governance. Thus, for instance,    while certain traditions understand that water governance must be structured    around the principles that water is a common good and that essential water services    are a public good that cannot be governed through the market, other traditions    defend the entirely opposed view that water must be considered as an economic    resource, essential water services as a private good, and that in consequence    the governance of water and water services must be centred on market principles.    These are just a few examples to demonstrate that the question about what exactly    "governance" means requires careful consideration. We come back to    this later.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The need to achieve a shared understanding of    the "water crisis" has also important implications for water-related    academic and techno-scientific endeavors, emphasizing the call for meaningful,    not just rhetorical, interdisciplinarity in water research. In this regard,    although a high degree of sophistication has been reached in the techno-scientific    fields related to water, such as hydrogeology, hydraulic engineering, or biotechnology    applied to water management, we are still very far from plainly understanding    the historical, socio-economic, cultural and political processes underpinning    the "water crisis". This gap between the techno-scientific and socio-political    fields of knowledge, we claim, may contribute to explain why the enormous technological    progress made in relation to water in recent decades has not been reflected    in more sustainable, efficient, effective and efficacious practices of water    management. Therefore, there is a need for establishing a balance between the    techno-scientific, socio-economic, political, and cultural aspects of water    management activities, and superseding the artificial separation of water research    and practice in disciplinary and corporatist feuds. Correspondingly, the development    of genuinely interdisciplinary approaches that contribute towards developing    water governance and management practices grounded on the principles of sustainability    and social justice is one of the most urgent challenges facing water governance    in the twentieth-first century.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>2<i> The "water crisis"</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Writing "water crisis" with inverted    commas denotes that the very notion that there is a water crisis is a contested    matter. The intensity of the debate and its propensity to become marred in circular    arguments are well reflected in the following statement from the First UN World    Water Report: "the water crisis that exists is set to worsen despite continuing    debate over the very existence of such a crisis" (UNESCO, 2003, p. 5).    To make things worse, the camp of those who accept the existence of a global    water crisis is divided, often irreconcilably, when it comes to defining the    dimensions, meanings, and extent of such crisis or, more importantly, to proposing    the actions that are needed for overcoming the crisis or at least for mitigating    its negative impacts. For instance, let us briefly explore the most recent edition    of UNESCO’s World Water Report, which follows on the steps of the 2003 report    in defending the argument that a global water crisis exists (UNESCO, 2006).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first thing that must be said is that the    report presents overwhelming evidence of the existence of a global water crisis,    and it is an excellent effort to reflect the multidimensional character of such    crisis. It reminds us that from the total water volume on earth only 2.5 per    cent is freshwater, and that only a fraction of this freshwater "in storage"    is usable for human consumption. This freshwater is unevenly distributed in    geographical terms, and is subject to severe and adverse pressures from naturally    occurring and human-driven processes. The report also identifies the main human    drivers of these impacts: </font></p>     <blockquote>        ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"population growth, particularly in water-short      regions, major demographic changes as people move from rural to urban environments,      higher demands for food security and socio-economic well-being, in-creased      competition between users and usages, pollution from industrial, municipal      and agricultural sources" (UNESCO, 2006, p. 121-136). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It also engages with arguably all the major themes    characterizing the water crisis, including the problem of essential water and    sanitation services, the water-related risks and threats to human health, the    links between water management and poverty, water for industry, agriculture    and energy, water for environmental sustainability, and the growing number of    environmental refugees displaced by climatic and human-driven processes (UNESCO,    2006, p. 9, 316). Moreover, and of greater relevance for this article, "governance    is an overarching theme" of the report and it certainly provides powerful    insights into some of the crucial challenges affecting water governance worldwide    (UNESCO, 2006, p. 45). However, the report is also an excellent example of the    protracted difficulties facing water experts, specialists, and practitioners    to overcome such obstacles to scientific knowledge as artificial disciplinary    boundaries, and continued lack of conceptual frameworks to develop truly interdisciplinary    coordinations, especially between the techno-sciences and the social sciences.    Let us consider some examples.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Firstly, in relation to the permanence of artificial    boundaries, the continued use of concepts such as "water sector" or    "water resources" throughout the report suggests that the dimensions    and concepts of traditional disciplines have disproportionate prevalence over    other approaches. A similar report where, for instance, ecological economists    or political ecologists play a more central role would certainly frame the analysis    with a different conceptual apparatus that incorporates the interconnectedness    that exists between water management and other human endeavors, which is lost    in the traditional treatment of activities as "sectors".</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Secondly, the report tends to define water almost    invariably as a "resource", including a chapter on "The state    of the resource" (UNESCO, 2006, p. 119). The document also pays attention    to the ecosystemic character of water issues, but the prevalence in the report    of a language that reduces water to one of its many dimensions, that of being    a resource for humans, illustrates the persistence of disciplinary enclosures    preventing cross-fertilization in the production of scientific knowledge about    water. The repeated conceptualization of water as a resource, used more than    1400 times in the document, would be strongly criticized by ecologists and ecological    economists, among others, as being tributary to a resource-oriented model of    water management that is actually responsible to a large extent for the current    "water crisis". There is a growing body of literature dealing with    these problems, including a number of studies focusing on "water security"    that highlight the implications and contradictions inherent in treating water    as a "natural resource", as a "commodity", as an "entitlement",    and so on (WEBB; ISKANDARANI, 1998; see also EUWATER, 2005).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thirdly, the treatment of water values, to which    the report dedicates a whole chapter, reflects the existing contradictions and    confrontations between irreconcilable positions on this subject. It also adopts    one of the main competing arguments without paying sufficient attention to alternative    positions in the highly contested debate about valuation. Let us examine first    the contradictions. The report states that</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"As a physical, emotional and cultural      life-giving element, water must be considered as more than just an economic      resource. Sharing water is an ethical imperative as well as an expression      of human identity and solidarity &#91;…&#93;. Valuing water, including sustaining      and fostering water-related cultural diversity, heritage and knowledge, is      critical to enhancing our ability to adapt in a changing world. Economic valuation      of water resources must be recognized as existing within this larger and more      complex context of valuing water" (UNESCO 2006, p. 403, 405). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a well-thought statement which raises    the reader’s expectations about the propositions that the report may have to    offer in terms of developing systems for capturing this multidimensional and    complex universe of water values. However, what comes next is a conventional    lesson on economic valuation of water resources and services that fails to live    up to the rhetorical recognition that economic valuation is just one among other    dimensions of the problem. Moreover, the approach to economic valuation that    is given central stage in the document is just one among a number of different    rival positions competing in the field, but this is not adequately explained.    For instance, the report classifies "residential water supply" and    "residential sanitation" under "Consumer Goods" within the    category "Commodity (or Private) Goods" and not under "Public    Goods", a category reserved in this document for the protection of the    "aquatic environment", "wild lands", and "biodiversity    and endangered species" (UNESCO, 2006, p. 409). Thus, an ongoing debate    taking place globally about the need to consider essential water services such    as water and sanitation as public goods, a social right, and a universal human    right, and not a private good or commodity is entirely neglected (see, among    others, WARD, 1997; PETRELLA, 2001; STRANG, 2004; EUWATER, 2005). Intentionally    or not, the report has abandoned here the scientific approach to support one    of the rival positions in the debate, without adequate justification. Once this    positioning of the authors has been identified, other apparent contradictions    in this crucial section of the document become more intelligible. For instance,    it states next that </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"Governance strategies should be selected      to optimize the achievement of societal goals. In this context, valuation      can be viewed as a fairly neutral and objective process by which social goals      and trade-offs can be identified and debated and the optimal governance strategies      chosen" (UNESCO, 2006, p. 410).</font></p> </blockquote>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Although in some passages of the document there    is a clear recognition that governance cannot be reduced to a policy instrument    (UNESCO, 2006, p. 46-49), the key section of the report "Responding to    the challenge of valuing water" is grounded on this instrumental understanding    of governance as a strategy to achieve certain goals. A number of questions    arise from this statement. How are these "societal goals" defined?    Who defines these goals? Why a particular language of valuation, economic valuation,    has been preferred over others? Who has the power to decide that this is the    relevant language of valuation for water management issues (on value diversity    and languages of valuation, see MART&Iacute;NEZ ALIER, 2002). What principles    inform this "governance strategy" based on economic valuation? The    instrumental understanding of governance adopted in this crucial section of    the document is, unfortunately, prevalent in the specialized water literature,    which has tended to depoliticise water management processes by treating them    as mainly (or even merely) "technical", "objective and neutral"    (we come back to this later).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have taken advantage of some gaps and internal    contradictions in what is otherwise a state of the art review of the situation    affecting the hydrosphere. Our main reason for discussing the above examples    is to cast light on some of the crucial challenges affecting the governance    of water in the twentieth-first century. We believe that the increasing rhetorical    recognition of the need for a more complex analysis of the water crisis, as    exemplified by the 2006 UNESCO World Water Report commented above, can stimulate    genuine attempts to develop a more comprehensive, interdisciplinary understanding    of water governance.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this regard, one of the common themes that    can be identified in the diverse international initiatives directed at tackling    the water crisis is the widespread recognition of the centrality of "good",    "effective" or "sound" governance (i.e. ADB, 1995; EC, 2000,    2002b; GWP, 2003; CAMDESSUS, 2003; COSGROVE, 2003; UNDP, 2004; UNESCO, 2006).    However, as already mentioned, despite the apparent agreement on the crucial    importance of "governance", the debate is marred by conceptual ambiguity    and is subject to the tensions inherent in the very nature of the process of    democratic governance. Let us briefly review some aspects of this debate relevant    to our discussion. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>3 <i>Governance</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The debate on governance is subject to underlying    confrontations between rival and at times even incompatible intellectual and    political traditions, which defend often irreconcilable opposing principles    and values. Although this is often blurred by the assertive use of the concept    in mainstream public policy documents, the fact is that different actors have    diverse, often contradictory, understandings of governance. This, consequently,    informs very different, frequently incompatible, policy strategies and decisions,    given that governance or, to be more precise, democratic governance is a political    process characterized by the confrontation of rival political projects grounded    on different values and principles. The case of water governance lends itself    as an excellent ground to illustrate these nuances. Rather than being just a    matter of pure academic disquisition, the contradictions between competing intellectual    and political frameworks underscore much of the institutional and political    transformations undergone in the field of water policy and management. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this connection, from a general perspective,    the concept of governance aims at conceptualizing evolving forms of government    and regulation that trascend those based on traditional state hierarchies and    market systems (HIRST, 1994; HELD, 1995; AMIN, 1997). In the field of development    policy, for instance, the concept of governance has become central to the argument    that the traditional forms of management based on "state monopoly"    over decisions and institutional arrangements are been replaced by new forms    characterized for "pragmatic pluralism" (ESMAN, 1991; see also UNESCO,    2006, p. 48). Thus, "governance" would be a process resulting from    the articulation of the classic forms of authority embodied in the state (hierarchical    organization) with those characteristic of the private sector (driven by market    competition) and the voluntary sector or "civil society" (characterized    by citizens’ voluntary action, reciprocity, and solidarity) (e.g. UNDP, 1997,    1998; PICCIOTTO, 1997; see also STREECK; SCHMITTER, 1985). For instance, in    reference to the situation in the European Union, governance has been described    as a multi-layered, multi-scale, and multi-sector ensemble characterised by    a combination of hierarchical structures, participatory dynamics, associative    action, and market mechanisms, and would be based mainly on a culture of dialogue,    negotiation, active citizenship, subsidiarity, and institutional strengthening    (HEINELT et al., 2002). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Far from being an abstract academic discussion,    this debate has far-reaching consequences for public policy in general, including    water policy. As already mentioned, despite rhetorical recognition to the contrary,    in the water policy literature governance is often understood instrumentally,    as a mean to achieve certain objectives, as a policy strategy, rather than as    a complex process of democratic dialogue, negotiation, and citizen participation    that includes the discussion about what objectives must be pursued by society.    Also, and closely related to the previous point, the conceptualization of governance    that tends to prevail in this literature often presents an idealized vision    of the interrelations between the main spheres involved: the state, the market,    and "civil society". This idealized version of governance presents    the state, the market and "civil society" as partners participating    in symmetric, triangular interaction, as in the notions of "public-private    partnership" and "tri-partite partnership", which have become    central in mainstream public policy (e.g. PICCIOTTO, 1997; UNDP, 2006; WORLD    BANK, 2006). We argue that there is a need to critically examine these instrumental    and idealized understandings of governance that can be identified in the policy    literature.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For instance, key concepts comprised in the notion    of governance, such as "civil society", have different, even opposing,    meanings for different intellectual and political traditions (see, for instance,    COHEN; ARATO, 1994; KAVIRAJ; KHILNANI, 2001). Thus, for the free-market liberal    tradition "civil society" is coterminous with the market: a sphere    of action characterized by the free concurrence of self-interested, egoistic    individuals pursuing their own ends. For free-market liberalism, a tradition    that has arguably exercised a major influence in global public policy, and certainly    in water policy, since the 1980s, there is no triangular interaction because    there are in fact only two partners in the picture: the state and the market.    Moreover, for this intellectual tradition the only role of the state should    be to guarantee the free operation of market forces, minimizing or, preferably,    cancelling state control and regulation over private actors (e.g. BROOK COWEN;    COWEN, 1998; NEWBERY, 1999). Let us emphasise here that although this minimalist    understanding of governance in the free-market liberal tradition is not widely    shared in the water-policy community, it has nevertheless exercised significant    influence in shaping public policy, including water policy, worlwide since the    1980s. As stated by Joseph Stiglitz, former Chief Economist at the World Bank    and 2001 Economics Nobel Prize, in his evaluation of the influence of free-market    liberalism in global public policy:</font></p>     <blockquote>        ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In setting the rules of the game, commercial      and financial interests and mindsets have seemingly prevailed within the international      economic institutions. A particular view of the role of government and markets      has come to prevail –a view which is not universally accepted within the developed      countries, but which is being forced upon the developing countries and the      economies in transition (STIGLITZ, 2002, p. 224-5; see also LEYS, 2001). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Stiglitz’s statement suggests, the free-market    notion of governance, that is, "the particular view of the role of governments    and markets" held by this tradition, is not widely accepted. It certainly    differs in substantial ways with the understanding of governance held by rival    intellectual and political traditions. For instance, contrary to the identification    of "civil society" with the market held by free-market liberals, the    pluralist and communitarian traditions tend to understand "civil society"    as the realm of voluntary action, reciprocity, and solidarity, a buffer space    between the market and the state. This understanding of civil society as a separate    sphere of action vis a vis the state and the market has played a crucial role    in the worldwide social and political struggles against dictatorships and authoritarian    regimes since the 1960s, and gained momentum since the 1980s with the fall of    the Berlin Wall and the collapse of military dictatorships in Latin America    and elsewhere. From another angle, this notion of civil society reflects the    expanding role of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), social movements, and    other actors that have become increasingly influential in public policy, and    certainly in water policy. On the one hand, this understanding of civil society    contributes to a more complex concept of governance that captures the multi-actor,    multi-dimensional, multi-sector character of public policy decisions and actions.    On the other hand, however, as already discussed, much of the water policy literature    tends to adopt an idealized notion of civil society as the realm of reciprocity,    voluntary action and solidarity, and this notion informs an idealized understanding    of governance as a balanced partnership between the state, the market and "civil    society". This idealized notion, in turn, provides the rhetorical framework    for the adoption of an instrumental understanding of governance, as a neutral    and objective tool or strategy for policy implementation, which is devoid of    any political content. Thus, in an apparent paradox, governance, which is essentially    a political process, becomes depoliticised in the water policy literature. We    come back to this in a moment, but let us briefly discuss first another aspect    of the complex nuances characterizing the understanding of governance: the diverse    notions and practices of governance in different political cultures. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The diversity in the understandings of governance    across different political cultures can be illustrated, for the sake of brevity,    by reference to the rival notions and practices characterizing the notion of    "citizenship" (see, for instance, DELANTY, 2000; VAN STEENBERGEN,    1994). "Active citizenship" is one of the main drivers of action within    "civil society" according to the understanding of governance prevailing    in the water policy literature. However, what are the notions and practices    of "citizenship" and "citizen participation" underlying    these discourses? Again, we are confronted with rival, even irreconcilable notions    of citizenship, although this fact is obscured in the policy literature which    tends to assume a shared understanding of this concept. For instance, free-market    liberalism has a particular understanding of citizenship that is limited to    the realm of civil and political rights. In a nutshell, the free-market notion    of citizenship is centred on the protection of individual rights, particularly    the right to own property, to formal judicial procedures, and to exercise the    political right of electing or being elected for government. The essence of    this tradition is the protection of individual freedom against state intrusion,    which includes freedom from state controls and excessive regulation in the pursuit    of market interests. Contrastingly, to give another example relevant for water    policy, for the social-democratic tradition, in its different national varieties,    the individual rights of citizenship are complemented by "social rights",    such as the right to have universal access to essential public services like    education and public health, which includes the access to affordable and safe    water and sanitation services. Social rights of citizenship in this tradition    are deemed to ensure the abatement of market-based social inequalities to provide    all citizens with a status that is independent of their market position and    thus enabling the less favoured members of society to exercise their citizenship    rights more fully. This notion of social rights is rejected in the free-market    liberal tradition, which considers social rights as an obstacle and not as vehicle    for individual freedom and citizenship. Moreover, these tensions at the heart    of one of the most cherished notions in modern western political theory, citizenship,    adopt a diversity of configurations in the different countries and political    cultures of the western hemisphere. As before, this is not merely an academic    disquisition that lacks relevance for the earthly concerns of those involved    in practical policy and management activities. The influence of the rival positions    about citizenship informing different political cultures can be clearly identified    in the current water policy documents, debates, and practices.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These considerations are even more relevant when    we address the situation of non-western and, particularly, developing countries,    given that notions such as "governance", "civil society"    or "citizenship" emerged from the specific historical experience of    Western Europe and the US and their empirical reference may be completely absent    in other societies. For instance, let us focus for a moment on the notion of    governance as a "partnership" which, as discussed earlier, presupposes    a balanced, symmetrical association between "the state", the "market",    and "civil society". In practice, this notion has no empirical correlate    in many countries, which are characterized by a frail public sector with low    or null capacity for regulation and law enforcement, and where "civil society"    is often limited to a small local elite, given that the bulk of society cannot    afford to participate meaningfully in the social and political life or take    part in the decision-making process. Unfortunately, this is the situation in    a large number of countries that are among the worst affected by the "water    crisis" and where the need for "good water governance" is consequently    more urgent. A recent report forecasts that many of these countries will not    be able to achieve the MDGs precisely because of the fragility of the public    sector and the resulting poor "governance" (WHO, 2005, p. 27, 71).    Thus, in many developing countries the notion of governance as a "partnership"    is meaningless, as citizens have no capacity to exercise democratic control    over public or private actors in charge of water management, and is often defenceless    in the face of water-related risks and hazards. However, this situation is by    no means limited to developing countries, given that citizen participation in    the process of environmental governance tends to be very limited in developed    countries too (DRYZEK, 1997; see also BECK, 1992, 1998).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Although many of these caveats about the meaning    of "governance" are well-known and form part of the wide-ranging debates    taking place around the world on this subject (e.g. GWP, 2003), in practice    the prevailing understanding of governance as an instrument or as an idealized    system of shared responsibility continues to permeate public policy decisions    and practices, including those involving water management. In our perspective,    one of the most crucial problems is that the mainstream water policy literature    tends to present a depoliticized understanding of governance, although it is    essentially a political process. The main mechanism of this depoliticization    of "governance" is the exclusion of ends and values from the debate,    thus reducing it to a merely instrumental, technical, supposedly neutral management    process or policy strategy. For instance, let us consider the suggestion for    water reform offered in a recent study commissioned by the World Bank. The authors    argued that:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The major thrust of institutional reforms within    the water sector is to enhance the functional capabilities, operational strength,    and institutional readiness to handle water challenges both at present and in    the future. Given this thrust, the main objectives of institutional initiatives    are rather transparent. These objectives are to: make water as an economic good,    strengthen allocation capabilities, increase the reliance on market forces,    revive the payment culture, ensure financial self-sufficiency, promote decentralized    decision structure, and encourage the adoption of modem technology and information    inputs (SALETH; DINAR, 1999, p. 36).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this statement we are presented with a number    of objectives for institutional reform. Leaving aside the discussion about the    suitability of these objectives, the main questions in relation to water governance    would be: who are the actors that decide that these are the main objectives    for reforming water institutions? What is the process through which this decision    is taken? What is the role of the citizens in this process? Are they consulted?    What mechanisms are available for them to participate in this process? Moreover,    what are the ultimate ends and values informing the adoption of such objectives?    And what understanding of water governance underlies the study’s approach to    the reform of water institutions? The reference to this study is just an example    of the contradictions inherent in the prevailing technocratic approaches to    water management. In this case, a highly political process such as that required    for reforming water institutions tends to be depoliticized in the analysis and    presented as a neutral, "transparent", policy instrument.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, there exist alternative understandings    of governance that provide elements for thinking beyond instrumental action,    as the following example illustrate:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The core of governance has to do with determining    what ends and values should be chosen and the means by which those ends and    values should be pursued, i.e. the direction of the social unit, e.g. society,    community or organization. Governance includes activities such as efforts to    influence the social construction of shared beliefs about reality; the creation    of identities and institutions; the allocation and regulation of rights and    obligations among interested parties; and the distribution of economic means    and welfare services. Governance, in other words, is the shaping and sustaining    of the arrangements of authority and power within which actors make decisions    and frame policies that are binding on individual and collective actors within    different territorial bounds (HANF; JANSEN, 1998, p. 3).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this perspective, governance cannot be reduced    to an instrument for the implementation of policy decisions taken, presumably,    by experts in the relevant fields (see, for instance, DRYZEK, 1997). Governance    is not a strategy, and is not an idealized scheme of interaction between also    idealized actors. Governance, always in this perspective, is a political process    involving the exercise of political power by political actors who seek to define    the ends and values that must inform social development. It also comprises the    identification of means to pursue those ends and values, and the adoption of    suitable arrangements for the exercise of authority and power in the process.    This understanding of governance immediately elicits a number of questions,    in the light of the previous discussion. What are the ends and values that inform    water policy and management? Who participates in the determination of these    ends and values? Who determines the means by which those ends and values should    be pursued? How are these decisions taken? How do common citizens participate    in the determination of those ends and values, and in the identification of    the means for pursuing them?</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this connection, the determination of the    ends and values in relation to water management, and the selection of the means    to pursue those ends and values, does not happen in a social vacuum. Rather    than being the result of a balanced partnership, the process of water governance    resembles a highly asymmetric and evolving structure where the actors tend to    have dissimilar proportions of political power and knowledge. In practice, water    policies that have often a significant political content are designed and implemented    with disregard for the values, opinions, and preferences of the citizens and    in the absence of democratic governance arrangements. In practice, water governance    consists in the interaction between governments, large businesses, political    parties, civil and other organizations representing sectoral interests (e.g.    workers’ unions, religious organizations, peasant movements, etc.), international    agencies (e.g. international financial institutions and other agents of the    process of "global governance"), NGOs, and other relevant powerholders.    These actors are involved in continuing debates and in social and political    confrontations around how water and essential water services should be governed,    by whom, and for whom. These confrontations are at the heart of the process    of democratic water governance, which is characterized not only by dialogue    and negotiation but also, unfortunately, by growing uncertainty and protracted    social and political conflicts. To this we turn next.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>3.1 Water uncertainty and conflict</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One particular area that requires urgent efforts    towards enhancing inter-disciplinary coordination between the techno- and the    social sciences concerns the study of the uncertainties and conflicts emerging    around the management of water and water services. Regarding water uncertainty,    debates on risk and "manufactured uncertainty" have emphasised environmental    threats and hazards among which water-related extreme events and human deficiencies    in the management of water have a central place (e.g., BECK, 1992; MCGRANAHAN    et al., 2001). International concern on these issues has led to a wide variety    of efforts aimed at assessing the dimension and scale of these risks in the    search for adequate approaches to limit their negative impacts (KASPERSON et    al., 1995; KASPERSON; KASPERSON, 2001; UNEP-UNICEF-WHO, 2002; WHO, 2003a,b;    WHO-Europe, 2003; UN-HABITAT, 2003; UNESCO, 2003, 2006; UNICEF, 2005). Similarly,    existing and potential conflicts over water at the international level have    elicited an ongoing academic and political debate and a number of important    initiatives oriented at preventing conflict and promoting water sharing and    cooperation (e.g. COSGROVE, 2003). We will come back to water conflicts but    let us first consider briefly the notion of water uncertainty and risk.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Arguably, the ultimate water uncertainty concerns    the very survival of the hydrosphere, and particularly its freshwater component.    Pressures on available freshwater are driven by contradictory forces such as    the rising water volumes extracted for human uses and the need to slow down    and reduce water abstractions to restore and protect the fragile equilibrium    of ecosystems and water bodies. In particular, water needed for agriculture,    which currently accounts for about 70 per cent of the world’s freshwater consumption    (estimates indicate that in some developing countries, but also in certain developed    countries, irrigation uses up to 85 per cent of freshwater abstracted), poses    a crucial challenge (BRUINSMA, 2003, p. 138; WORLD BANK, 2004, p. 5, 14). For    instance, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization forecasts that developing    countries will need an average increase of 14 percent in irrigation water withdrawals    until the year 2030, which according to FAO will not have a significant impact    on the aggregate available freshwater (BRUINSMA, 2003, p. 140-142; the document    admits that individual countries are already in a critical situation). However,    environmentalists claim that to stop the generalized overpumping of aquifers,    falling water tables, and rapid deterioration of aquatic ecosystems water abstractions    should be significantly reduced to restore sustainable water levels (BROWN,    2005, Chapter 6). The critics point at dramatic examples such as the Dead Sea    (FRIENDS OF THE EARTH, 2006) and the Aral Sea in Central Asia (ALTYEV, 2006),    which have shrunk to a fraction of their original sizes as a result of extensive    irrigation and water-consuming industrial activities, and these are just two    examples in a long list of dying rivers, lakes, aquifers, wetlands and water    bodies (BROWN, op. cit.). In this context, it is difficult to foresee how we    could possibly achieve simultaneously food security and sustainable water management.    Similar dilemmas are faced in other areas of water management owing to competing    demands on freshwater sources coming from rising living standards in urban areas    of developing countries and from the expansion of cash crops and tourism in    water-scarce regions, or from the worldwide destruction of mangroves through    the expansion of shrimp farming, to mention just a few areas of concern. Other    authors have also examined how social cleavages grounded on poverty, gender,    and ethnicity, among other factors, impinge on the water insecurity affecting    large sectors of the world’s population (WEBB; ISKANDARANI, 1998). These and    other water uncertainties, in turn, are intimately related to existing or potential    conflicts over water, which we examine next. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>3.1.1 Water conflicts</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The prospect that social and political conflicts    over the distribution and allocation of water will increasingly "become    a key part of the 21st-century landscape" is regularly restated by international    leaders (e.g. VAN GINKEL, 2001). For instance, in February 2006 the British    government issued a dramatic warning about the increased likelihood of "wars    over water" and announced that its military forces must be prepared to    intervene in "humanitarian disaster relief, peacekeeping and warfare"    related to dwindling natural resources, particularly water (THE INDEPENDENT,    2006). This is not entirely surprising given that over the last few decades    international security experts have warned that water was becoming more important    than oil as a potential source of conflicts around the world (GLEICK, 1993,    2000). Some authors have pointed out that the fact that global freshwater sources    are unevenly and irregularly distributed, that some regions of the world are    extremely water-short, and that water bodies are often shared by two or more    countries is a looming source of conflicts, and the situation would be set to    worsen as we progress into the twentieth-first century. These warnings seem    to have good ground when we consider that 263 river basins, where about half    of the world population is located, are shared by two or more countries (COSGROVE,    2003, p. 1). It is also estimated that fewer than 10 countries control about    60 percent of the world’s freshwater sources, and a large number of groundwater    aquifers are shared by two or more countries (OHLSSON, 1992; SAMSON; CHARRIER,    1997). Nevertheless, this notion that international water wars are imminent    is fiercely contested by authors who argue that there is scarce historical evidence    in favour of the hypothesis that transboundary waters tend to be the cause of    war between countries and that rather peaceful cooperation in water sharing    would have been the main international pattern for millennia (ALLAN, 2001; COSGROVE,    2003, p. 10-11; YOFFE et al., 2004).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This highly relevant debate on the potential    for international water conflict and cooperation is far from being settled.    However, there is a second dimension of water conflicts that continues to receive    relatively less attention in the mainstream water policy literature: intra-national    water conflicts. This characterization may be misleading, as in fact in many    cases water conflicts have both an inter- and an intra-national dimension. Nevertheless,    the focus here is particularly on social struggles over water that range from    confrontations over the control of water bodies and water infrastructure to    urban conflicts over the inequalities and inefficiencies in the access to essential    water services. On this subject, there is solid historical evidence showing    that the control of water and water systems has played a significant role in    the emergence of social and political conflicts, and continue to do so. Thus,    water control has been a major factor in the establishment and consolidation    of asymmetrical power relations often leading to structural conditions of inequality    and injustice in the access to water, not just in the classical "hydraulic    civilizations" studied by Karl Witffogel (WITTFOGEL, 1956, 1959) but also    in recent centuries and to the present time. Among other cases it can be mentioned    Bolivia (CRESPO FLORES et al., 2003), India (SHIVA, 1992), Italy (SANTINO, 1994,    2003), Mexico (MUSSET, 1991; BENNETT, 1995; PERL&Oacute; COHEN; GONZ&Aacute;LEZ    REYNOSO, 2005; CASTRO, 2006), Spain (ARROJO AGUDO; MART&Iacute;NEZ GIL, 1999;    BCFS, 2004), and the United States (MEYER, 1984; WORSTER, 1985; HUNDLEY, 1992;    BERRY, 1998), just to mention some examples.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In more recent years, the record of intra-national    water conflicts include from peaceful demands to the authorities, judicial litigation,    demonstrations, mass parades, and other forms of civic protest including civil    disobedience such as non payment of taxes or water bills, to direct confrontations    involving in the extreme the destruction of property (e.g. destruction of water    infrastructure) and often the loss of human lives. Although these forms of water    conflict have become widespread around the world (see, for instance, SHIVA,    2002; BOUGUERRA, 2003; BARRAQU&Eacute;; VLACHOS, 2006), they tend to receive    less attention in the mainstream water policy literature. However, this is arguably    one of the most difficult challenges facing water governance in the twentieth-first    century: while it may be possible that the predictions about future international    water wars are exaggerated, the occurrence of intra-national social struggles    fuelled by water inequality and injustice is unlikely to diminish in the foreseeable    future.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>3.2 Water conflict as an object of knowledge</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As suggested in the previous discussion, water    conflicts are part and parcel of wider social and political confrontations between    alternative, often antagonistic societal projects, confrontations that are at    the heart of the process of governance. However, the aim of this chapter is    not to explore the confrontations themselves but to contribute towards the development    of interdisciplinary coordination in the production of scientific knowledge    about water conflicts, which requires the exploration of how physical-natural    and social processes interweave. In this regard, the evidence shows that the    emergence of water conflicts is seldom the sole result of "natural"    causes such as freshwater scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions. Cooperation,    solidarity and successful bottom-up "water governance" arrangements    have been developed in very adverse conditions of natural water scarcity, as    in the classical example of medieval Valencia in Spain (GLICK, 1970), but also    in places as pre-colonial Bali in Indonesia (GEERTZ, 1980), Ceylon (LEACH, 1959),    or the Philippines (OSTROM, 1990) to mention a few typical cases. Conversely,    there are obvious examples of protracted social conflicts over water in the    context of very favorable hydrological conditions such as in Guayaquil, Ecuador    (SWYNGEDOUW, 2004) or in the state of Chiapas in Mexico (CASTRO, 1992).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, on the one hand, the production    of scientific knowledge about water conflicts, and in general about water, is    characterized by high fragmentation along the lines of entrenched epistemic    cultures that continue to develop largely unconnected from each other. On the    other hand, however, the existing fragmentation in the knowledge about water    conflicts offers an excellent opportunity to develop genuine interdisciplinary    approaches that bring together the expertise developed in the techno- and the    social sciences, and other epistemic fields. In this regard, relevant suggestions    for the study of water conflicts can be found in the interdisciplinary field    of political ecology, which is concerned with the study of "ecological    distribution conflicts" (GUHA; MART&Iacute;NEZ ALIER, 1997, p. 31). Political    ecological perspectives have inspired an expanding body of water research (SWYNGEDOUW    et al., 2002) on a number of problems ranging from the links between conflicts    over the provision of urban water services and the process of global capital    accumulation (SWYNGEDOUW, 1999, 2004), the multidimensional character of water    struggles arising from neoliberal water reform policies (LAURIE et al., 2002;    LAURIE, 2007), to the interrelations between intra-national water conflicts    and the long-term development of citizenship (CASTRO, 2006), just to give a    few examples.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, the development of interdisciplinary    strategies for the production of knowledge across the techno- and the social    sciences continues to be difficult and progress is slow. Among other aspects    that require further consideration is the fact that knowledge about water is    produced from a number of distinctive, often unconnected epistemic perspectives,    and the resulting fragmentation of knowledge tends to become structural owing    to entrenched disciplinary and institutional power configurations, a problem    which is not limited to the field of water research (e.g., KNORR CETINA, 1999).    For instance, in our studies on contemporary social conflicts over water in    Mexico we identified a number of distinct epistemic subjects involved in water    management activities who understand and explain water conflicts from very different,    often unconnected perspectives (CASTRO, 1995; 2006). For the sake of the analysis    we derived from the empirical research the existence of three epistemic subjects:    the water expert, mainly water engineers and others directly involved in the    techno-scientific aspects of water management, the water functionary, who are    members of the bureaucratic and policy-institutional apparatuses in charge of    water management activities, and the critical social scientist, referring broadly    to the work of social scientists producing knowledge about water from a critical    perspective such as contemporary political ecology. The evidence suggests that    these different subjects construct their knowledge about water conflicts on    the basis of different rationalities and epistemic structures, which underpin    the identification of very different observables for the identification and    explanation of "water conflicts" (on the concept of observable see    PIAGET, 1978, p. 43-6; 1977, p. 342-6.). <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, where    we have added additional examples of epistemic subjects involved in water research,    illustrates schematically the diverse approaches of these subjects to "water    conflicts".</font></p>     <p><a name="tab01"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v10n2/a07tab01.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For instance, in the early 1980s Mexican water    experts elaborated a map of "conflicts over water in the main Mexican cities"    to predict the occurrence of such events between 1980 and the year 2000 (SARH,    1981, p. 50). A close examination showed that they grounded their analysis on    quantitative observables, such as the interactions between water availability,    demand, supply, consumption, cost and population, urban and industrial growth    over the period under analysis. They conceptualized urban water conflicts from    a techno-scientific perspective and, therefore, in their analysis conflict would    be the result of the lack of expected correspondence between quantitative variables,    such as a geometrical increase of water demand in the arid areas of the country    where water availability was already compromised in 1980. In contrast, for the    "water functionary", the notion of water conflicts places the emphasis    on a different array of observables, which can also be illustrated from our    research on Mexico. Besides the techno-scientific rationality (after all many    water functionaries are techno-scientists by training) they are subject to policy-bureaucratic,    and often also party-political, interests such as concerns about the impact    of water conflicts on electoral prospects. Therefore, their observables are,    for instance, the recurrent events of urban social protest over the poor quality    of the water services or the civil disobedience of water users who have decided    not to pay their bills in protest for a recent hike in the tariff. In general,    the water functionary must deal with processes that fall outside the technical    domain of the expert, such as "popular discontent", "the social    and economic characteristics of the population" that create conditions    for water troubles, or the inherent contradictions between "the economic,    social, psychological and environmental values of water" (SARH, 1981, p.    14). In turn, the critical social scientist is concerned with the task of making    observable the intertwining between the social regularities and physical-natural    processes that are at the heart of water conflicts. For instance, and remaining    with the Mexican example, the socio-political rationality of this subject provides    a framework for inquiring into the socio-economic and political mechanisms that    underpin the exclusion of a large fraction of the population from access to    safe and affordable water services, a major cause of water conflict in Mexico.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A similar scheme of analysis could be applied    for the treatment of water conflicts in other areas of activity, such as the    widespread struggles against "water privatization" or the opposition    to large scale hydraulic works like dams and inter-basin water transfers. However,    the scheme in <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a> is only a simplification to cast    light on the distinctive rationalities operating in water research and policy,    which may help to better understand some of the key obstacles for interdisciplinary    coordination in the study of water conflicts. It is important to clarify that    the epistemic subjects represent bodies of knowledge and traditions of thought,    not individuals or collective actors, who in practice may embody one or more    epistemic cultures. We believe that the identification of the conceptual frameworks,    rationalities, and observables operating in the field of water research, as    we have attempted to sketch here, is an essential exercise to strengthen the    foundations of meaningful interdisciplinary in this field.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>4 <i>Conclusions</i></b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is increasing recognition that the "water    crisis" is mainly a crisis of governance. Unfortunately, although the use    of the concept of "governance" often assumes a shared understanding,    in fact there exist underlying confrontations between rival theoretical bodies    of knowledge and political and cultural traditions for which governance has    entirely different meanings. Moreover, much of the mainstream debate on the    topic has been aimed at depoliticising the processes under discussion and presenting    them as mainly (or even merely) "technical" in nature, probably in    the belief that depoliticising water management activities would provide opportunities    for abating or at least controlling water uncertainty and conflict. An important    aspect of this debate concerns the question of social participation in relation    to problems of water uncertainty and risk, which is a central component of the    process of democratic governance. How are the risks associated with water management    communicated to the wider public? How do citizens participate in the process?    What mechanisms are available for them to participate? How are the societal    goals informing water policy identified? What ends and values are prioritized    in these goals? What means are chosen to pursue those ends and values? What    languages of valuation are chosen in the process? Who takes these decisions?    Who are the actors that these decisions intend to benefit? What mechanisms of    democratic control exist to monitor decision makers and implementors of water    policy? These and other similar questions are at the heart of the process of    democratic governance, and we know that this process is undergoing a severe    crisis worldwide. Unsurprisingly, this crisis of water governance is being increasingly    expressed in the form of inter-, and particularly, intra-national social and    political conflicts over water, which present one of the most formidable challenges    for the scientific community involved in water research and practice.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our conclusion draws on the perspective of one    of the epistemic subjects sketched above, the critical social scientist, which    stems from a long-standing tradition in the social sciences concerned with developing    the appropriate cognitive structures for making observable such structural regularities    as cyclical social conflicts –whether in relation to water or not. However,    the task of elaborating adequate explanations of the causes and consequences    of water uncertainty and inequality requires the development of further interdisciplinary    coordination between the intellectual domains of, for instance, water engineers,    hydrologists, and social scientists, which to date has been a slow and relatively    fruitless endeavour. The existing gap between the intellectual domains developed    by techno-scientists and critical social scientists concerned with social inequality    and struggle remains a major obstacle to achieve this goal. The persistence    of this obstacle continues to hamper our full understanding of "water conflicts’’,    and consequently diminishes the chances we may have to avoid their negative    consequences, which almost systematically affect the most vulnerable sectors    of the population.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this connection, there is a need for adopting    a critical perspective of the understanding of water governance as an instrument,    a supposedly neutral policy tool, which aims at depoliticising what is essentially    a political process. The idealized and instrumental approaches to water governance    tend to neglect in their analysis, despite rhetorical recognition to the contrary,    the existence of fundamental social divisions underpinning water insecurity,    injustice, and inequality, which are major drivers of water conflict. Thus,    a truly inter-disciplinary approach to the problem must strive to make observable    those processes that create and reproduce the structural socio-economic and    political inequalities that continue to preclude a large sector of the world’s    population not only from participating in the governance of water, but even    from accessing essential volumes of safe water for daily survival. This kind    of approach requires addressing "water conflicts" as an object of    knowledge on its own right, which constitutes a crucial step towards transforming    the unacceptable conditions characterizing the "water crisis". Our    work seeks to make a contribution towards this daunting venture by calling for    efforts to develop higher levels of coordination between the different cognitive    structures and epistemic cultures involved in the production of knowledge about    water. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ALLAN, T. <B>The Middle East water question.</B>    Hydropolitics and the global economy.

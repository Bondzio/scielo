We owe the notion of intersectionality to a group of Afro-American feminists and lesbians who in the late 1970s denounced their white sisters' racial blindness for overlooking the former's specific discriminations due to social class, 'race', sex/gender, sexuality, etc. In the meantime, intersectionality has become as fashionable in feminist theory as it is short of empirical grounding. In this article I draw on my classical study Racismo y Sexualidad en la Cuba Colonial (1974, 1992) precisely to document the dynamic intersectionality between class, "race" and sex/gender in an unequal society whose order was rationalized in terms of a racist doctrine which in turn required the control of its elite women's sexed bodies. This naturalization of social inequality was possible on account of the modern ontology that dissociates culture from nature.

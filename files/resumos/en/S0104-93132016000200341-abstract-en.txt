Abstract Drawing on a theoretical perspective that understands age and ethnicity as intertwined cleavages, this article discusses their effects on the communalisation process of the Mapuche community of Newen Ã‘uke Mapu (Rio Negro, Argentina). It focuses specifically on the case of lof Mariano Epulef in the context of this community. The analysis deals with how contemporary generational articulations of "young Mapuche" give meaning to the political genealogy of the movement that developed in the last decades of the twentieth century and also, at the same time, to family and community genealogies. The article likewise addresses the ways in which these genealogies define generational articulations. This task involves studying the critical generational appropriation of political Mapuche discourses by "young Mapuche" within rural communalisation processes.

ABSTRACT The beginning of Mário de Andrade&#8217;s intellectual career is marked by his many approximations to the German composer Richard Wagner. In this article, I would like to present three excerpts that show how these two authors meet: the first is Mário&#8217;s reading of Wagner&#8217;s work; the second concerns the importance of this composer and his aesthetic project in the history of music; the third relays the case of a presentation by Oswald de Andrade that makes a comparison to the opera Parsifal. From these excerpts, I would like to propose a reading of Mário de Andrade&#8217;s musical thought that may be used as a basis to understand his aesthetic thinking.

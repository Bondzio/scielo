ABSTRACT: The theme of alterity can be read in Hannah Arendt in a twofold manner. The first, grounded on Eichmann em Jerusal√©m, refers to denying the other as the incapacity to put oneself in the other&#8217;s place as well as to suppress the other through the nullification of their uniqueness. The second, drawing support mainly from The human condition and What is politics?, explores the conditions for alterity by focusing on the assumptions of action - world and plurality - and its powers - initium, revelation and energeia. Such conditions refer to amor mundi and to the responsibility attached to it as an educational condition (formation) so that the other can effectively become other.

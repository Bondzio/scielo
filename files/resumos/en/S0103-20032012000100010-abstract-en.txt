This paper presents the main results of the socio-economic assessment of small farmers involved with tobacco crops and other cash crops in the Vale do Rio Pardo region, in Rio Grande do Sul state, in Brazil. The study aims to provide evidences for the implementation of effective crop substitution and diversification programs in tobacco producing countries/regions. A questionnaire survey involved a sample of 299 small family farms in the Vale do Rio Pardo region. The sample was designed to include both small farmers who are fully or partially dedicated to tobacco production and farmers who are mainly dedicated to other agricultural products instead of tobacco. The study shows that, in the Vale do Rio Pardo region, tobacco farming activities account for about 60% of the gross value of the production in agriculture. However, the comparative analysis of the profitability of tobacco crops and other cash crops in this region shows that alternative crops might offer lower gross income than tobacco, but offer a higher net income, because their production costs are lower.

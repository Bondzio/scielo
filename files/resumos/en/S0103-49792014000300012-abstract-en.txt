The article discusses the Habermasian comprehension of the process of economic globalization, while implicating in the disruption of intervening and regulatory functions of the welfare State. From that, I try to reconstruct his defense of the necessity of implementing supranational political institutions which could, with its regulatory and interventional functions, substitute a few tasks of the Nation State. For realizing these tasks, the action of social democracy and the emphasis on the European Union would have an important part, which would give non-communists left-wing western people and Europe the opportunity of realizing an emancipatory theoretical-political project in a supranational level, while representing an opportunity for the left-wing in the beginning of the 21st century, and also a second chance for Europe. The article ends with considerations regarding the urgency of consolidating a politics of social evolution, be it internally or, in this case, worldwide, which would be a fundamental demand nowadays.

Abstract This paper aims to evaluate paradiplomacy as regards the city of Rio de Janeiro, by investigating the city&#8217;s actions, policies and international integration strategies. The method used involved both secondary data analysis and semi-structured interviews with public actors of municipal organizations. The results show that the city&#8217;s international involvement grew considerably after its announcement as host of the 2016 Olympics.

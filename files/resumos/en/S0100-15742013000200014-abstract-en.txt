This article aims to highlight learning management and difficulties of science teachers who participated in continuing education programs in the distance learning mode. In a case study, data were collected through interviews and questionnaires. Regarding the difficulties, five areas were identified: content, technology, available time, didactic-pedagogical and personal. In this area, the interlinked variables of "age" and "time teaching" in addition to "experience" showed significance for distinguishing the successful group. Younger teachers and those with less time teaching had lower utilization. Different learning management strategies were observed during free time on evenings and on weekends. The results may be useful for planning continuing education activities for practicing teachers via distance learning.

This article discusses ethnographically how police patrol styles interfere in interpellation situations and responses that involve the interaction between police and residents in urban areas. It analyzes how the resident&#8217;s condition is mobilized by military police from an area covered by the Round the Block Policing Program, in the city of Juazeiro do Norte, south of the state of Cear√°. This experience of community policing, called &#8220;the good neighborhood police,&#8221; also employs conventional elements of ostensible police work and the residents of this community are morally classified by the police in various labels, represented by the opposition between &#8220;bum&#8221; and&#8221; good citizen.&#8221; These police ways of talking about residents are intermediations of power that attribute subjective forms to residents. The meaning of &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; becomes polysemic, in that residents are affected by these labels, and are validated, revalidated, selected or ignored in every situation.

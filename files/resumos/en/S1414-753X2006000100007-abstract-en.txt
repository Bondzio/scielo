The Institutional Economics seems to be more appropriate than the Neoclassical Economics to explain actual situations. To address this issue, the influence of information on the participation of rural settlers in a project of environmental conservation implemented by a non-governmental organization was assessed. The participation in the project showed weak association with the information about participation's socio-economic and environmental benefits, provided by the non-governmental organization. As far as the participation in the project is concerned, a rational behavior associated with commitment, in an environment favorable to the emergence of norms to cooperate, showed to be more significant than the information.

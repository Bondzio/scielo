Abstract Thinking on possible links between woman&#8217;s writing and homeplace, this paperwork presents a comparative study of three Carolina Maria de Jesus&#8217; books: Quarto de despejo (published in English as Child of the Dark: The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus), Casa de alvenaria (I&#8217;m going to have a little house: the second diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus), and Di√°rio de Bitita (Bitita&#8217;s Diary: The Childhood Memoirs of Carolina Maria de Jesus). Writing and homeplace can be both considered as spaces of women&#8217;s self-elaboration and here they permeate a comprehension of Carolina&#8217;s diaries, considering: i) home as space of resistance; ii) the Carolina&#8217;s houses as places of writing and archiving; iii) home as a perspective, and iv) cartography of imagined homeplaces.

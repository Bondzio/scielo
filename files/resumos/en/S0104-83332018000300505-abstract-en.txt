Abstract The aim of this study is to analyze the participation of women in teaching activities at a public university, specifically related to extension activities. Data was collected from an internal management system for extension activities and the university website for personnel management. The participation of women and men in extension activities at seven departments was analyzed. It was found that women are concentrated in areas whose activities receive a lower contribution of external resources.

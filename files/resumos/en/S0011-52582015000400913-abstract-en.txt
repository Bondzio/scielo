ABSTRACT The aim of this article is to contribute to the debate concerning inequalities in income earned from labor in Brazilian metropolitan regions, incorporating among its determinants the residential location of individuals. Income inequalities are analyzed based on the contrast between three models of multiple linear regression &#8211; Mincer, Credencialismo and over-education &#8211; according to the data from the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD), conducted by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) in 1998, 2003 and 2009. We observed that residential location in the metropolis has an effect in the explanation of income inequalities and can be assessed by means of a two-fold scale of the social division of territory, according to the nucleus-periphery model and the favela-not favela model. The analysis of this double scale proved important in generating empirical tools that made it possible to construct hypotheses concerning the mechanisms that explain the differences between individuals in terms of income based on analytical contributions from the field of urban sociology, particularly studies on the effects of neighborhood.

Abstract: The article discusses the agency of bullying notion in the Brazilian reality, anchored in the ethnography of school experience of a student in a public educational institution, located in the Rio Grande do Sul State (Brazil). The ethnographic narrative of this child trajectory is powerful to evidence ambiguities that permeate today the bullying agency. These ambiguities are obscured in the current public debate due to the scientific credibility of the concept. Such ambivalences report the existence of victims of bullying more legitimate than others; the prerogative of a speech about the differences to the detriment of the question about inequalities; besides the coeval operability of bullying with other constructs with contemporary efficiency, like the medicalization.

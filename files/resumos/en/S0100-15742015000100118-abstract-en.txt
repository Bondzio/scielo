The investigation included the study of federal and municipal legislation and documents, especially municipal balance sheets, as well as relevant literature on the contributed to the topic. The increase in municipal revenues for MDE observed during the period may have contributed to the universalization of fundamental education and to the compulsory expansion of basic education.

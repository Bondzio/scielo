Abstract: The objective of this article is to analyze Axel Honneth&#8217;s theoretical critical construction of social institutions as actualization of the social freedom which provides conditions to self-realization and justice. Its method consists in an internal reading of the development of Honneth&#8217;s work and in the light of its consonance with critical theory. In conclusion, the article discusses to what extent the moral progress of these institutions is related immanently with the actualization of their internal principle or externally with a normative pressure of equality coming from law and democracy.

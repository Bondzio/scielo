As the production and commercialisation of organic food has been expanding since the 90s, both in the international and Brazilian context, supermarkets have assumed a dominant role in relation to alternative markets. This article intends to contribute to the analysis of this role, especially in the commercialisation of fruits, legumes and vegetables (FLV), and to identify the types of consumer that are addressed by their strategies. I use diverse bibliographic references - specialized publications of the retail sector and reports of international consultancy agencies. Through this material it is possible to characterized supermarket strategies in relation to organics in the world and particularly in Brazil. Also, through the analysis of those strategies, it is discussed the profile of the organic consumer. One of the main arguments of this article is that the growing consumption of organics at the supermarkets is part of a more broad demand for healthy food, that is also part of a lifestyle characterized as ego-trip, in opposition with one that can be more ecological responsible, the ecological-trip style of life.

This article proposes an agenda on "educational matters" which is meant for binding afair education to democracy after the reforms carried out in the 90's. First it describes the current state which is characterized by three processes: a. a school deinstitutionalization process which is expressed both in terms of the difficulty to keep a socially-sanctioned normative framework, and the identity crisis the institutions currently go through; b. a fragmentation process of the educational system which is different from the traditional segmentation of the systems; c. the wearing out of the theoretical and conceptual instruments on which we have been traditionally supposed to rely for organizing and making sense out of reality's phenomena. On this framework the article proposes: 1. to discuss the limits of educational modernity in peripheral countries such as ours and, in this context, those of modern pedagogy in order to deal successfully with discrimination and educational; 2. to review the concept of citizenship as well as the role ascribed to school in the shaping of citizenship; 3. a second thought and discussion on the role of knowledge and research in changing the practices in politics and pedagogy.

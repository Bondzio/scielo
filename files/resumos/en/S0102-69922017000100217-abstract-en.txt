Abstract This paper approaches the relative absence of black women amongst the top-incomes in Brazil. The top-incomes are defined as the 1% of people with higher earnings from their main job. We apply logistic regressions to address in what extent educational levels explain the black women's disadvantages on the probabilities of being rich. Through simulations based on the same logistic models, we address the contribution of discrimination for these disadvantages. This paper also addresses how race affects the social status of rich black women, considering matrimonial dynamics as a plausible indicator for status formation. The hypothesis is that rich black women have difficulties to match rich partners, for discrimination in some extent prevents their economic affluence to work as a source of social status. We apply multinomial logistics regression to address the matrimonial dynamics. The data is from the 2010 Brazilian Census.

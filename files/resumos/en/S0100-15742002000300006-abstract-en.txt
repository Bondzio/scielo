The purpose of this article is to contribute to the history of mathematics teachers and researchers training at the National Faculty of Philosophy - FNFi. The negotiation process to select foreign visiting professors to work in the Mathematics program is described, as well as the curriculum proposal. The difficulties faced by foreign mathematicians during the Second World War are shown, and their contribution expects to the development of research in Brazil is analyzed. The first Brazilians to play a leading role in mathematics teaching and research during the early years of the maths course at the FNFi, Jos√© Abdelhay and Leopoldo Nachbin, are acknowledged. The period analyzed, 1939 to 1950, includes the foundation of the FNFi and spans to the mid-1950s, when disputes for academic space in the field of Mathematics began.

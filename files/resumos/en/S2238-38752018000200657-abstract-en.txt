Abstract Multiple aspects of Anthony Seeger's professional trajectory are approached in this interview, conducted in the Graduate Program in Sociology and Anthropology, on May 5, 2015. Seeger's strong connection with the banjo leads a conversation that runs through his family and musical ties; his encounter with anthropology at Harvard University and later in Chicago, in the midst of which he also developed his studies of folklore and music; his remarkable passage through Brazil, his research on the K&#297;sêdjê and his teaching experience in the Graduate Program in Social Anthropology, at the National Museum of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. His dynamic experience at the forefront of the Folkways Collection at the Smithsonian Institution and his international involvement in intangible cultural heritage policies at UNESCO are also addressed.

Abstract: This work deals with the links between Gender and Social Memories of Dictatorship in Chile, focusing on the political trajectories of left-wing female activists. We begin by problematizing the connections between Gender and Memory, followed by an analysis of the beginning of these women&#8217;s political activity. We draw from a Life History methodology to learn about women who participated as young activists during the Popular Union, were politically persecuted after the Coup d&#8217;Ã‰tat, were involved in resistance groups, and remain politically active today. The analysis explores the way gender is reproduced and challenged in the making of a memory of the recent past. Departing from there, we conclude about the appropriateness of a Women&#8217;s Standpoint as a starting one, as Feminist Epistemologies claim, in order to articulate Social Memory and Gender.

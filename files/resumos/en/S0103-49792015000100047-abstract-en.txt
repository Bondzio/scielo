This article analyzes the works by sociologist Alberto Guerreiro Ramos as a part of the field of peripheral sociology. From an internal reading of his texts written in the 1950s, we suggest that a transnational approach of his intellectual output may contribute to inserting the history of Brazilian social thought in the field of the global history of post-WWII sociology.

The aim of this article is to convey a type of sociological thinking still not much spread in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul: sociology of experience, theorized by French sociologist François Dubet. The effort is aimed at deepening the understanding of the concepts developed by that author, not only from the theoretical point of view, but also regarding their possibilities for application to the empirical field. That is why an analysis of two of his works will be carried out: Sociologie de l'Expérience (Sociology of Experience) e Dans quelle société vivons-nous? (Which society do we live in?), in an attempt to understand society's contemporary expressions, in its apparent crisis of values, ambiguities and incoherencies. The reflection will lead to a set of questions that remain open, among which, how does Sociology of Experience concern Brazilian society?

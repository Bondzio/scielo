This paper offers an appraisal of a mechanism of Payments for Environmental Services (PES) in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. The estimates were performed for two regions: the Arc of Deforestation and the Legal Amazon. The estimates were based on a cost of opportunity of R$ 123.00 per hectare and the definition of the eligible public was based on the area and the income generated by the farms in these two areas.

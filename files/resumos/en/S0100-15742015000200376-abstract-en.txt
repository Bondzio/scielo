This paper presents an innovative experience in training undergraduate psychology students at the University of Talca. A learning environment was designed supported by the method of problem-based learning, in order to improve decision making possibilities of future psychologists and preparing them for a possible intervention in an educational context. The results of the experience showed a slight increase in students' performance, greater commitment and participation, self-management in information search as well as the ability of problematizing.

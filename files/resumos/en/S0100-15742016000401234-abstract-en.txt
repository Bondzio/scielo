Abstract In this paper we discuss the relationships between education and otherness based on a survey carried out with foreign students invited to discuss Brazilian films in a classroom situation. Based on thinkers such as Alain Badiou, Carlos Skliar and Julia Kristeva, we describe the ways in which narratives mobilized young people around the complex issue of the "vision of the foreigner" and its relevance for education. We discuss the expectations of the foreign student regarding a culture different from theirs, when in contact with audiovisual narratives produced in Brazil. The conclusions bring new issues based on the work with the students, which focus on the theme of ethical and aesthetic education, raised by the experience with the film and with otherness.

In this context, citizenship works as a meaning offer strategy for the socioenvironmental movements in search of public visibility. Based on an empirical study, this article identifies the cultural matrixes of the journalistic field and the socioenvironmental movements. It analyzes how the source frames its speeches to provide its agendas with visibility, and the position occupied by the environmental matrix in this interaction.

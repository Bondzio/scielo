Abstract In Argentina the universality of primary schooling is almost achieved, and high school access has increased, but problems in regularity, retention and graduation still persist. Taking as a starting point the fact that families&#8217; social origin has an effect on children&#8217;s educational trajectories, we analyze, in urban areas, the relation between social class, territory and housing conditions with the chances of developing school lag and dropout. We propose a logistic regression model using data from a national probabilistic survey, comparing primary and high school levels. We found that, especially at high school, the studied dimensions have an effect on school lag and dropout. And, in particular, the role of the household educational climate is fundamental in the transmission of intergenerational inequality.

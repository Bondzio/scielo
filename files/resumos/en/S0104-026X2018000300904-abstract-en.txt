Abstract: This paper presents part of the authors&#8217; postdoctoral research at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. It focuses on the transformation processes triggered by feminist-driven governmental actions in Brazil, Argentina and Chile over the last few years, especially during the terms of Cristina Fernández, Dilma Rousseff and Michele Bachelet. Using concepts and theoretical insights from specialized literature, we address questions about lobbying and disputes in the political arena in order to understand the impact of feminisms on public policies, and the extent to which these policies relate to the intersectional nature of discrimination (gender, race / ethnicity, class). Four major public policies areas are examined, namely economic autonomy, social facilities, health, and violence, from three analytical angles: 1) the role of women&#8217;s policy agencies in policy making processes; 2) Gender-Aware Public Policies during the mandates of female presidents in Argentina, Brasil e Chile; 3) the intersectionality of gender justice in public policy-making.

abstract After decades of neglect and lack of both public and private investments, Paim Street, located in an important central district of SÃ£o Paulo, underwent a process of re-signification and spatial deconstruction in the first decade of the 21st century. Despite all the theoretical advances achieved by the approval of Federal Law 10.257/01, also known as "Statute of the Cities", the selective application of the main urban instruments available to guarantee the social function of urban property created the ideal conditions to turn Paim Street into a great, highly profitable but exclusionary and gentrifying real estate opportunity. Using the example of Paim Street, this study aims to investigate the production of urban spaces during that time period as a reflection not only of the real estate market, but also of the guidelines defined by the city's Strategic Master Plan.

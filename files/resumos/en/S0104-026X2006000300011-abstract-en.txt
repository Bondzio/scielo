On considering the strength of antifeminist discourse in Brazil, I examine how this discourse circulates in the field of cultural journalism so as to raise some relations with Brazilian social history in the light of which it is possible to understand why feminism as a praxis of change seems so alien to the country's social habits. To develop my line of argument I draw from works of Brazilian intellectuals from the left, while I point out the limits of analysis that silence on women's oppression and on questions of gender. Then, I examine the persistence of diverse forms of antifeminist discourses in the academic field of letters, in the attempt to understand the status of feminist criticism in literary studies and the reasons for its invisibility, with remarks on the achievements and limitations of its practices.

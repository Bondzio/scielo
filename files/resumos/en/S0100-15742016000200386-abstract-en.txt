This study aims to propose an approach to the concept of school justice, on the issue of the just school, in the light of Rawls' theory of justice and Bourdieu's critical theory. Looking for a way to understand school justice that takes into account the theoretical merits of these theories, the text is divided in three parts: the first is a reconstruction of Bourdieu's criticism of the school and its role in perpetuating inequalities prior to school experience; then, it examines Rawls' theory of justice as fairness, , paying particular attention to the meaning of education and the fair school; Finally, inspired by the formulation of the principles of justice as fairness, two principles of school justice are proposed.

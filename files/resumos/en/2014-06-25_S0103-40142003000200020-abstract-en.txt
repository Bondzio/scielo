How did São Paulo become one of the three largest cities in the planet during the 20th century? Although its development is frequently compared to that of cities like Liverpool, Milan, and Chicago, São Paulo possesses an identity of its own. In this essay, the author offers four centuries and a half of São Paulo's history, from the earliest stages of portuguese colonization to modern times. The essay is divided in three parts: from its origins to Independence (1822); from Independence to Republic (1889); and from industrialization to modern city. Throughout the article, many of the main authors who dealt with this subject, such as Cortesão, Boxer, Caio Prado Júnior, Richard Morse and Milton Santos, are discussed.

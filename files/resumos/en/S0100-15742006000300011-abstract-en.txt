In this study, modern city is focused as one of society's way of existence, as a polyphonic space and in its relations with Education. More than a geographical landscape, it is reinforced the idea of city as a symbol to be disclosed, as a place that should be that of the citizen. In this sense, it is worth to question: What is to be a citizen today? Who owns the word in modern city? And, in the attempt to discover the cities which co-exist or antagonize themselves in the megalopolis we invite people from different social groups to express the images they make of a big city like SÃ£o Paulo. In this text, four of these groups - those constituted by small peasants, boys and girls that live in the streets, students of suburban schools and young rappers singers - were discussed. The speeches and the images of each group were synthesized in the following categories of analyses: the "imagined city", "the city seen from a far distance", the "disenchantment of the city" and the "contested city".

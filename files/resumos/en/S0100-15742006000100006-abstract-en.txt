This case study on systematic failure of boys in elementary school is inspired by educational ethnography. It refutes the first explanations provided in the educational literature which tended to identify the differences in gender socialization as the cause of the problem. Opposite to their male classmates, girls seemed to face less difficulties because they were supposedly educated to be passive and comply with rules. Based on an empirical research conducted at a public school of SÃ£o Paulo State school system, it was possible to verify that these fixed male and female patterns do not exist. An intricate plot of masculinities and femininities tightly connected with students' social status was found to exist and have different effects on failure/success at school.

The present paper proposes a shift in ecofeminism. If this theorethical perspective already criticized the women-nature symbolic connection, it has not explored yet the connections between sexual diversities and nature and the discussions about our heteronormative projections in nature. Gaard states that Western culture has its grounds in a fear or hatred not only of homosexuals and their sexual intercourse, but of eroticism in general. She names it erotophobia, and it is because of erotophobia that non-reproductive sexual acts are viewed as moral deviation or perversion. To show us how pervasive erotophobia is she analyzes the history of Christianity and the colonization of America to highlight the conections between different forms of oppression (of women, of queer sexualities, of non-white people, of nature). What characterizes a queer perspective in ecofeminism is exactly the attention to thinking those interconnections and a will to rethink and liberate the erotic as a form of power.

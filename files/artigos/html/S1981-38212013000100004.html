But circumstances changed after Dmitry Kozak's announcement that the   federal budget for the entire region would decrease significantly.&nbsp; As all the   republics in the North Caucasus are dependent on federal aid of no less than   50% (in Ingushetia, Chechnya and Dagestan dependence is superior to 80%), such   cut represented a politically potential danger.</font>    <br>     <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main&nbsp; goal of the article is to present a deeper understanding       of the potential link between the international and regional economic dynamics       and the current acceleration of social disruption in the North Caucasus region.       The paper explains how ethno-political and transition studies can benefit from       the inclusion of the economic dimension into the analysis, and so it clarifies       the importance of a bi-level analysis using two concepts: economic society and       economic security. The paper employs the concepts of economic security and       economic society to perform a richer and innovative analysis.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Keywords:</b> Human Security, North   Caucasus, Insecurity, Insurgence, Ethno-politics</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Theoretical framework</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the literature, transition and ethno-political phenomena are more   often linked to political and social features, even with historical legacies or   anthropological data, than to economic data. According to Paul Blokker, "until   the end of the 1990s, the debate on 'transition' was dominated by approaches   that shared a number of elementary assumptions on the general nature of social   change" (Blokker, 2005: 504), which is generally downgrading the real   importance of economic features. The majority of authors studying transition   processes and ethnic politics tend to look at economy only as a secondary   element of analysis. However, if we take in stock that "the most fundamental   human interest, it is argued, is the maximization of life chances, from which   flow the instrumental pursuits of wealth, security and power" (Hale, 2008: 3),   we can begin to understand the real importance and impact of economy in the   political transitions all over the world. If economy, that is the path to   achieve wealth, is one of the fundamental human interests, its absence as a   central element of analysis in ethno-political or transition studies undermines   the conclusions about the multiple paths contemporary societies are threading. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With this paper, we set out to connect economy with ethno-political   and transition studies focusing on the impact of the global crisis upon Russia   and its consequences for the North Caucasus insurgency. In order to approach   these topics, we will make use of the concept of human security in a double   manner: (1) as a mediator between ethno-political and transition studies, on   the one hand, and economic dynamics, on the other; and (2) as a trigger for   more sophisticated analyses. Crucially, the paper aims at probing whether there   is a connection between the global crisis beginning in 2007 and the upsurge in   the North Caucasus violence.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Henry Hale (2008) states, economy is important to ensure the   maximisation of human life. In line with that argument, we can assert that the   degree of economic wealth of a country or a region influences the development   of every transition process. In this matter, Juan Linz and Alfred Stepan assert   that "the final supportive condition for a consolidated democracy concerns the   economy, or rather the arena we believe should be called "economic society"   (Linz and Stepan, 1996: 11). The authors state that truly free and democratic   societies are those that show open and free markets promoting the values of   equality, democracy and competitiveness. While the merits of open markets and   command economies can be argued and debated, we can assume as a starting point   for this paper that "economic interests may play a role in ethnic conflict"   (Horowitz, 2000: 106), urging the necessity to include a more sophisticated   analysis of this dimension into ethno-political and transition studies research.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The sphere of economic society &#151; abstractly conceived of, under a   veil of ignorance as it were &#151; is certainly made up of institutions,   regulations and norms, but there is no direct state control and no protecting   mechanisms. The bottom line is the ability of the actors to create value that   will define the winning and losing sides of the economic game with no regard to   the ethnic origin or the social status. That's why for liberals the market is a   force for inclusion and integration, depoliticised as it were, and for some the   actors should even enter the contract under the veil of ignorance in order to   prevent unfair inequalities arising from the social background and personal   handicaps.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In line with this, it is possible to assert that the workings of   this depoliticised arena in transitional societies might be able, at least   partially, to promote more motivation towards integration (or at least to   non-violent coexistence and non-violent secessionism) because all actors have a   basis to be equally considered in the economic game. In Henry Hale's (2008:   161) perspective, the economic workings also play a political and motivational   role, considering that "those ethnic regions that stand to gain the most from   union, therefore, will tend to be willing to take the greatest perceived chance   of exploitation, whereas those that stand to gain the least will be among the   first to 'jump ship' as the perceived exploitation rises".</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We can then assume that the degree of functionality and openness of   economic societies is directly linked to the ability to promote integration, or   at least guarantee non-violent coexistence or even non-violent secessionist or   separatist projects. Besides the integrative function, an open and   non-state-guided market is also more capable of accommodating the divergent   interests of ethnic elites transforming a potential enemy (the central state)   into an acceptable and desirable broker. At this point, we can argue that   "transitions clearly were most likely to occur in countries at the middle and   upper-middle levels of economic development" (Huntington, 1993: 62). Since   that, those countries could easily ensure political as well as economic   pluralism.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this dialectic relation between economic societies' stage of   development and successful transitions, ethnicity tends to be rationalised or   instrumentalized as a "strategic choice by individuals who, in other   circumstances, would choose other group memberships" (Bell, 1975: 171).   Integration or separatism will be decided through a calculus of gains and losses   that tend to make richer regions more prone to separatist drives, since they   have most to lose by prolonging an attachment to a certain non-homogeneous   state apparatus.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This argument could explain why the poor Karakalpakstan region   wasn't able to secede from Uzbekistan and has gradually refrained its demands   short of independence. And it also elucidates the motivation of Catalonia to   achieve greater autonomy, since it is the most economically developed and   sustainable of all Spanish autonomies. But it doesn't explain why the   Trans-Dniester insists in its separatist stalemate with Moldova. Even being   Europe's poorest country, the Moldovan republic is in a better economical   condition than the separatist region.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although a more rationalist-economicist perspective is suitable to   some separatist cases, we should not ignore that "the emergence of democracy   &#91;and subsequent open and inclusive societies&#93; is not a by-product of economic   development" (Przeworski and Limongi, 1997: 177) and, therefore, "many separatist   groups all over the world have proceeded to fight for ethnic autonomy despite   the costs" (Horowitz, 2000: 132). In our understanding, human motivation is not   linear and rationality could be accounted for in several ways, for example,   instrumentally and non-instrumentally.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is crucial to underline, however, that the path towards   integration, secessionism or separatism is not only influenced by the ability   to establish an open market, and to build an economic society, but by a larger   set of different factors. Despite the difficulty to measure the impact of   economic behaviour and its influence upon integration, secessionism or   separatism, it is generally consensual that the more difficult it is to build   an economic society, the more the levels of ethno-political uncertainty   tend to increase and feelings like loyalty, solidarity and cooperation tend to   deteriorate.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although it is inaccurate to assert about a strict casual relation   between the establishment and development of economic societies and the   tendency towards integration, secessionism or separatism, it is also incorrect   to ignore that states where economic societies are virtually non-existent tend   to live without economic security, which is one of the seven dimensions of the   UN's Human Security concept. Originally put forward by   the PNUD in 1994, "the concept of human security represents a powerful, but   controversial, attempt by sections of the academic and policy community to   redefine and broaden the meaning of security" (Baylis, Smith and Owens, 2008:   492). With this kind of approach, experts, analysts and policymakers have   started to broaden their focus and concerns and move them away from the threats   states pose to states.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This multidimensional conception of "security" proposed by the UN   gives a "response to the complexity and the interrelatedness of both old and   new security threats (...) Such threats tend to acquire transnational dimensions   and move beyond traditional notions of security that focus on external military   aggressions alone" (United Nations, 2009: 16), leaving aside such important   challenges to contemporary societies as economic crisis, persistent and endemic   poverty, and social unrest.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Presently, the concept of "human security" continues to be under an   enormous debate that does not fall under this paper, but it almost unanimously   accepted that "when people are uncertain where the next   meal will come from, when their life savings suddenly plummet in value, when   their crops fail and they have no savings &#150; human security contracts"   (Commission on Human Security, 2003: 73), since this type of disruption causes   instability that tends to raise the prospects of violence and to the emergence   of exclusivist notions of psychosocial identity such as ethnic separatism.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through a "human security" perspective, we   look more attentively to threats and vulnerabilities of human beings and   sub-state communities, knowing that "human insecurity   can arise from want of a job, lack of access to food, threats to health, poor   infrastructure, oppression by the state, social discrimination and prejudice,   crime, and so on" (Human Development Network, 2005: 2);   in this regard, it is already plausible to argue that in advanced and   functional economic societies, economic security (micro level) and human   security (macro level) tend to be strengthened.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The relevance of a correlated analysis using the concepts of   economic society and economic security is practically unquestionable if we   recall that "poverty is one of the most serious and   persistent threats to human security (...) &#91;since&#93; it affects all aspects of   human security understood in terms of "freedom from want"" (Unesco, 2008: 66). Developed economic societies are more able to downsize the   prospects of poverty and, consequently, to raise the variables that ensure a   human-secure environment. Summing up, this is why we consider that a new focus   on the economic performance is of much help, towards a new understanding of the   path chosen by political elites in transitional societies, whether this implies   a transition towards democracy or autocracy, towards integration or separatism.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before concluding the theoretical part of this paper, we should   notice that economic society and human security cannot be mixed together, even   if they both share in the prerequisites of the economy realm. Economic society   is the institutional domain affecting the transitional path of states and other   political entities towards a variety of different social and political futures.   In this line, economic society represents a macro level of analysis.   Alternatively but complementarily, human security represents a more micro level   of analysis to human vulnerabilities that are conceived as a challenge to the   more institutional setup. They are conceived of as unnecessary limitations to   the freedom from want, wherein every human needs to fulfill his or her inherent   dignity.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Throughout the paper, we make use of these two levels of economic   analysis in order to ensure a better understanding of the phenomena affecting   the newly created North Caucasus Federal District. The main aim of this paper   is not to put forward political solution though, even if it hints at what could   be perceived as draft suggestions to specific problems. The remainder of the   paper is as follows. The next section offers a short historical synopsis of the   paths that both the Russian Federation and the North Caucasus economies have   taken in the last twenty years of their recent history. After that, we will   probe how the disruption caused by the economic global crisis in the enfeebled   economies of the North Caucasus Federal District could help in explaining the   upsurge in regional violence.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Historical synopsis of the Russian Federation and North Caucasus   economies</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to comprehend the evolution of the economic state of   affairs in the newly created North Caucasus Federal District and its probable   connections with the growth of separatist demands and regional violence, we   should start to look to the Russian Federation's recent economic history.   Broadly speaking, in the last twenty years (1991-2010), the economy of the   Russian Federation has undergone profound transformations. The first ten years immediately   after the implosion of the Soviet Union were dramatic. Under Boris Yeltsin's   rule, the (important) ability of the Russian state to collect taxes was reduced   so much that "between 1989 and 1997, state revenues fell by nearly 45 per cent"   (Freeze, 2009: 470). As a direct consequence, there was a disruption in major   social services such as education and culture, but there were also cuts in   security, law enforcement and public health budgets.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Russian Federation's feeble economy didn't guarantee stability   or even daily certainty, and suffered from the exponential growth of bribes and   illegal parallel markets. Yeltsin implemented several measures, the most famous   being the disastrous Gaidar's "shock therapy", which proved to be ineffective   given that "between 1991 and 1998, Russian national income shrank by about   half, one of the steepest peacetime falls ever recorded anywhere" (Wasserstein,   2007: 714), not even comparable with the economic falls of the United Kingdom,   Germany or the United States during the 1930s Great Depression. On one side the   Federation struggled to acquire control over tax collection and to regain   international trust in order to seek foreign loans; on the other side, "there   were persistent constraints upon entrepreneurial innovation. The government did   precious little to impose the rule of law" (Service, 1997: 526), with there   being a significant growth in internal corruption and a decrease in foreign   investments as a result.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yeltsin's final, desperate measure, the "loans-for-shares",   collapsed in the financial crisis of August 1998, a period also known as <i>Catastroika</i>.   In sum, in the first decade after the implosion of the Soviet Union, the   economy showed a continuous weakness and sheer incapacity to recover both on   domestic and international levels. To have a more accurate idea of the   weaknesses of the Russian Federation's economy, it is important to know that in   only six years (1991&#150;1997), "the GDP dropped a staggering 43 per cent (...) &#91;as a   result of that&#93;, Russia's per capita GDP in 1999 was only 4,200 dollars &#151;   slightly more than Botswana (3,900 dollars), but less than Namibia (4,300   dollars) and Peru (4,400 dollars)" (Freeze, 2009: 475), states that are usually   approached as poor and part of the Third World.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With a frail and, in some moments, uncontrolled economy, it was more   than expected that "poverty rates rose significantly over the transition years   (...) The Russian Bureau of Statistics reports that poverty increased from 10&#150;12%   in 1990 to 25%&#150;33% in 2000" (Brookdale Institute, 2003: 11), threatening the   economic security of the Russian population and strengthening the claims to   greater sovereignty of several ethno-political leaders &#151; not just in North   Caucasus, but also in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan and Sakha republic. Without the   capacity to fulfill basic daily needs, populations tended to become more   willing to adhere to nationalist and separatist groups and to promote or even   practise violent acts.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall, "Yeltsin's choice to privilege economic restructuring over   democratic state restructuring weakened the state, weakened democracy and   weakened the economy" (Linz and Stepan, 1996: 392), threatening the transition   towards democracy in itself and jeopardising the production of human security.   The disruption in the economy produced a destructive wave in all other areas   from public health to culture and to public security. At the end of the   millennium, the situation in the Russian Federation neared total chaos.   Yeltsin's unfruitful reign in the first decade after the collapse of the Soviet   Union was followed by the arrival of a new strong and charismatic leader:   Vladimir Putin.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Practically unknown to the majority of the social and even political   circles in Moscow, the former director of the secret police FSB (<i>Federal'naya     sluzhba bezopasnosti Rossiyskoy Federatsii</i>) and former director of the   Security Council started a progressive economic transformation. There were   several economic reforms started under Putin's rule, but none of them used   policy measures as extreme as the ones chosen by his predecessor. The reforms   that were implemented proved to work: from 2000 to 2008, the GDP of Russia in   Purchasing Power Parity (the PPP corrects distortions of nominal currency   values) rose 202% from 1,120 billion dollars to 2,266 billion dollars (Index   Mundi, 2011), upgrading the Federation's economic situation from a feeble   condition to the eighth largest economy worldwide. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, we must never lose from sight the rise of revenues for   the trade in commodities in order not to overstate the reach of Putin's   policies. The majority of economic data prior to the recent economic global   crises was favourable to Putin's administration though. In the first decade of   the twenty<sup>-</sup>first century, the <i>per capita</i> GDP rose   from 4,200 dollars (2000) to 14,600 dollars (2008), allowing a general   improvement in life conditions, across the Russian Federation. Rising income   made possible the allocation of money to health, education, social security,   and to fight poverty. According to the World Bank, poverty rates in Russia   decreased from 19.2% in 2002 to 11.1% in 2006 (World Bank, 2012)</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What some call the 'miracle' orchestrated by a certain strategic   vision of Putin's was also facilitated by "the red-hot global economy of those   years (1999-2008), which generated a sharp surge in demand for commodities,   especially hydrocarbons, metal, and timber &#151; Russia's principal exports"   (Freeze, 2009: 498) to the global market. Another essential factor to Russia's   rapid economic recovery was the depreciation of the ruble after <i>Catastroika</i>,   which made Russian products less expensive and thus more competitive, an   occurrence similar to China's economic success that was partially achieved   because of the depreciated Yuan and Chinese products compared to those sold in   Pounds, Euros, Dollars or Yen.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite this major economic growth, some areas continued to be   underdeveloped. Justice reforms proved to be shortly effective and were   sometimes even simple rhetorical exercises of the Kremlin's newest tsar.   Federal and regional bureaucracy also hadn't achieved a high level of   proficiency. Putin's first priority was to stabilise the domestic markets and   to improve the international image of the Russian Federation in political and   economical spheres. However providential and effective, Putin's economical   choices had produced an extraordinary dependence on commodities: "In 2009,   Russia was the world's largest exporter of natural gas, the second largest   exporter of oil, and the third largest exporter of steel and primary aluminum."   (Commodities Street Journal, n.d.)</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Russia's incapacity to diversify its exporting portfolio transformed   it into a fragile state in a scenario of global economic crisis, like the one   spreading throughout the world in the second semester of 2008. At the beginning   the crisis produced a sharp reduction in the oil prices. In order to prevent a   new <i>Catastroika</i>, "the government had to raid the foreign exchange   reserves (...) &#91;that had&#93; shrunk from 598 billion dollars to 426,5 billion   dollars by early January &#91;2009&#93;, and dropped to 388 billion a month later (a   decrease of 35 per cent)" (Freeze, 2009: 524). These most needed initial   measures weren't enough to prevent the depreciation of the ruble, and had   slowed down growth in the Russian Federation.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cycle of economic transformations and the rhythm of its multiple   effects weren't identical in all regions of the Russian Federation. In the   specific case of the North Caucasus, the economic history of the last 20 years   was as plain as it was dark. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, "political   killings and inter-ethnic discord afflicted virtually every Russian republic"   (King, 2008: 232) in this region in addition to the revival of ethno-national   separatism and the explosion of Islamic extremism. In a paper published in   2009, Sergey Markedonov signalled that "in the Russian North Caucasus, the main   challenge to regional security is posed by illegal armed formations, acts of   sabotage, and terrorist <i>jamaats</i>" (Markedonov, 2009: 14) that have been   revived in the last three years across the entire North Caucasus. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The never-ending socio-political unrest had such atrocious   consequences on the economy that "the extent of this economic collapse is   difficult to grasp, as it had few precedents in recent history (...) by the   mid-1990s, up to half of the population of the South Caucasus lived below the   poverty line, and though less reliable, figures in the North Caucasus were even   worse" (Cornell and Starr, 2006: 36). Adding to this dramatic picture, they   reached the highest unemployment rate in the entire Russian Federation. The   combination of these factors undermines the economic security of local   populations, making it easier to adhere to extremist Islamic movements or to   ethno-national separatist projects.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In comparative terms, the North Caucasus republic with the lowest   rate of unemployment in 2008 was Adygea, reaching 8.5%<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> among a total   population of more than 440,000 citizens. Ingushetia's republic recorded the   highest regional rate of unemployment, with 47.4% of the population (comprising   fewer than 500,000 citizens) being without a job (K&ouml;rbel, 2009: 2). According   to Thomas K&ouml;rbel (2009), young people unemployment in Ingushetia was even   higher, above 70%. These rates are partially responsible for the upsurge in   regional violence. Without hope for a better future, being deprived of a   regular job and proper living conditions, youngsters tend to adhere to   extremism or separatism as a way to improve their possibilities, to achieve the   maximisation of life options.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the levels of violence and political defiance, the unstable   North Caucasus is economically important to the Russian Federation because it   ensures direct access to both the Caspian and the Black seas. The shocking fact   is that, even with this potential relevance, the North Caucasus "is regarded as   the least attractive region in the entire country for foreign investors"   (Matveeva, 1999: 44) because of this continuous socio-political instability. In   the years of the Yeltsin presidency, the North Caucasus underwent a gradual   deterioration of living conditions as a consequence of the Russo-Chechen wars   as well as other ethnic conflicts (those of North Ossetia and Ingushetia and in   Dagestan). The parade of conflicts partially explains why since 1991, it has   "constituted the poorest regions of the entire Russian Federation" (Coene,   2009: 190), with the overall lowest indicators on socioeconomic development,   excluding birth rate (the highest in the entire Federation).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prospects of a change in the beginning of the new millennia were   soon dropped. In fact, "under Putin the region has not beneficiated   significantly from the oil and gas" (Melvin, 2007: 44) productions in the   region. The need for heavy investment to modernise regional refineries and   factories and the unattractiveness of this area to foreign investment was   responsible for the actual decadence. It is a strange historical irony that the   first region of the Soviet Empire where oil was exploited, the region that in the   1920s accounted for more than 10% of the Soviet production in oil, "has lost   its prominence as a fuel base. In the early 1990s, it accounted for 1,8 per   cent of the crude oil and 0,8 per cent of gas production" (Matveeva, 1999: 44),   with the current figures supposedly being even lower.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary sector in the North Caucasus is also heavily affected by   this endemic underdevelopment. For example, "agriculture seems to work somehow,   but only to the extent of providing some basic food products to the region"   (Liono, 2000), giving no prospects to business opportunities in this sector.   The socioeconomic relevance of agricultural activities in the region can be   heightened if we remember that "by the end of the 1990s, only one region   &#91;Northern Caucasus&#93; had more than four private farms per 1,000 persons"   (Wegren, 2003: 44) in the entire Russian Federation territory.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Differently, the Ossetian alcohol production is a significant   business representing almost 20% of the raw materials placed in the Federation   market for the production of alcoholic drinks. Although we can argue that this   is a small and geographically limited success, we have to agree that this is "a   satisfactory figure for a region where money does not fall from the skies"   (Liono, 2000). The tourism sector also has great economic potential, especially in the   republic of Kabardino-Balkaria because of the ski resorts in the Elbrus. The   reality is that "tourist facilities have only 25% occupancy rate" (Liono,   2000), which is mostly ensured by domestic   tourists and by foreigner tourists from Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several researchers criticise the lack of a multilevel strategy in   Putin's policies for the regions that are as focused on security issues as   unable to solve them. The critical fact is that "the absence of truthful   programs of nation building and economic development in this region is denying   an improvement of the current situation" (K&ouml;rbel, 2009: 3) and is even creating   new problems, such as the previously mentioned phenomenon of juvenile delinquency   that has flourished as a consequence of the lack of jobs. Some measures of the   central administration have deepened some economic structural problems.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the Federal Administration has tried to circumvent those   hindrances through the Regional Support Fund, given that "the largest net   recipients tend to be the relatively rural, less developed regions of the North   Caucasus" (Smith, 1999: 195), the fact is that the region continues to be   unable to overcome its chronicle underdevelopment. One of the main reasons for   this scenario can be attributed to the absence of urban settlements. "According   to the data of the population census of 2002 in the North Caucasus, we see no   big cities" (Lordkipanidze and Totadze, 2010: 162) except for Makhachkala (capital   of Dagestan) that overcomes half a million inhabitants.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this regard, there is little surprise when we perceive that we   have in the North Caucasus the 2<sup>nd</sup> (Ingushetia), 4<sup>th</sup> (Dagestan), 6<sup>th</sup> (Chechnya), 7<sup>th</sup> (Kabardino-Balkaria), 11<sup>th</sup> (Karachaevo-Cherkessia), 14<sup>th</sup> (Dagestan), and 15<sup>th</sup> (Adygea) most subsidised regions (Perovic, 2006: 7) in a total of 83 federal   subjects (there were 88 subjects until the administrative reform of 2008)   composing the Russian Federation. The effort to keep those regions artificially   stabilised through federal monetary subsidies, which account from more than 58%   (Adygeia) to almost 90% (Ingushetia) of the subjects' budget, might be in peril   due to the world crisis scenario like the one faced by the Russian Federation   since the second semester of 2008. From here on, we would like to stress how   the disruption caused by the economic global crisis in enfeebled economies like   the ones in the North Caucasus Federal District could help to explain the   upsurge in ethnic violence. We will use the concepts of economic society and   economic security to guarantee a proper bi-level analysis on ethno-political   and transition phenomena.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Economic society, economic security and   ethno-politics in the North Caucasus</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The North Caucasus is one of Russia's most distinctive regions. It   encompasses one of the thirteen military districts<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a>, one of the twelve   economic regions<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a>,   and it has also been the eighth federal district since 19 January 2010. Until   that date, the North Caucasus territories were inside the Southern federal   district that after the split has only maintained the Ciscaucasian   constituencies of Adygea republic, Krasnodar krai and Kalmykia republic. In a   speech to the Federal Council on 12 November 2009, Dmitri Medvedev "argued that   the region's problems derive in the first instance from economic backwardness,   unemployment, and high-level corruption" (Caucasus Report, 2010), a factor that   undermines the confidence of the local population in federal and regional   institutions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The economic factor is so decisively important to begin to solve the   numerous problems of the region that even the choice of the governor to the new   federal district took the fact into account. The appointee, Aleksandr   Khloponin, is a former businessman with a short but very successful political   career in the Siberian Federal District. The nomination of Khloponin can be   understood as the Kremlin's statement that economic issues should be the   primary focus of power. Aleksandr Khloponin knows that he urgently "needs to create   a normal living environment in the North Caucasus, in particular improving   socio-economic environment" (Jackson, 2010) in order to ensure economic   security and to promote the development of a truly economic society. The North   Caucasus Federal District summons all four major threats to human security:   besides the high rate of unemployment, it has "insufficient economic resources,   unstable economic flows and asset losses" (Commission on Human Security, 2003:   73), creating a bulk of circumstances that undermine the narrow confidence of   the locals in Moscow's capability to solve real problems.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the pressing necessity to solve these economic security   vulnerabilities, only in the beginning of July 2010 did the first governor of   the North Caucasus Federal District present his plan to solve the region's   socioeconomic problems, with an expected prominence on economic and financial   measures. In the document presented to Medvedev (at that moment, President of   the Russian Federation), Khloponin "proposes launching priority projects, along   with improving the overall investment climate in the North Caucasus in   2010&#150;2012 and starting an 'active growth phase' in 2013&#150;2025" (Dzutsev, 2010).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The two major proposals put forward by Khloponin were a huge   investment in transport infrastructures<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> and a downgrade or even an elimination of taxes on economic initiatives   developed in the region. Despite their merit, these two initiatives are in   jeopardy mainly because of the effects of the global crisis on the Russian   Federation's central budget. The development of the North Caucasus transport   infrastructures requires big sums of money that only Moscow could ensure to the   local government. Prior to the global crisis, this wouldn't have been a   problem: the amounts of money given to subsidise the republics' inefficient   socioeconomic programmes<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a> could easily have been diverted to this kind of specific project.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The global crisis has introduced a new degree of complexity and has   even produced some incongruence and contradiction in the political speech. In   September 2009, Dmitry Kozak, the Deputy Prime Minister and former governor of   the Southern Federal District, stated that the "Russian government plans to cut   subsidies to the republics of the North Caucasus" (Goble, 2009) in order to   invest that money in other regions. However, by mid-July 2010, Khloponin was   demanding more funds from the Kremlin to develop the economy of the North   Caucasus. To be accurate, no substantial numbers were given either about the   amount of money to be cut or on the timeline to apply those cuts. But it was   crucially made sure that the cuts were inevitable.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This double-faced discourse from political leaders produces at least   confusion in the local population. How can someone ask Moscow for money if   Moscow has said beforehand that money was ending? Surely Khloponin knows that   in the near future, "Medvedev and Putin might be hard pressed to rationalize   such a huge budgetary outlay on this rebellion region, whose inhabitants are   racially maligned by a significant portion of &#91;the&#93; Russian society" (Leahy,   2009). This is the same society that, at the same time, does not believe in any   kind of mid-term success in the region and that has been called onto the polls   to elect a new president. Even if the Kremlin could ensure the amounts of money   needed to fulfill Khloponin's ambitious programme, there is another barrier   ahead: republic heads/presidents<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a> and ethnic leaders. To ensure the proper execution of the investment programme   proposed by the North Caucasus Federal District governor, the decisional power   would have to be concentrated in Khloponin. But the condition for that to   happen is that "Moscow will have to break up the local government circles and   redistribute power, something that is hard to do without jeopardizing an   already unstable situation" (Dzutsev, 2010) in a region where local leaders   have an almost absolute power in economic and social policies already menaced   by the mere presence of the Kremlin-appointed governor.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The promises of Khloponin on heavy investments in transport   infrastructures and factories across the North Caucasus as a tool to fight the   insurgency had a pernicious effect. On 22 July 2011, the chief engineer for the   Dagestan's company Sulaksky Hydro-Energy Cascade was abducted following the attack   on the Baksan hydroelectric plant, which was located at the Kabardino-Balkaria   republic and perpetrated by a group of six militants. At the same time, the   numbers of terrorist attacks in Dagestan's railways have grown during the last   few months. These attacks have a symbolic message stating that economy is not   the major problem to solve in the North Caucasus. Insurgency fighters are   battling for political representation, and simple economic measures will not   stop their demands. Khloponin's socio-economic programme is perceived as a   challenge to which they've given a strong and bloody answer.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Going back to the subject of the predictable downsizing of federal   budgetary aids, it is important to stress one more issue that can contribute to   the upsurge of violence in the North Caucasus. The reduction of the money   received from Moscow would make it much harder to achieve regular processes of   loyalty production. Until recently, "federal subsidies have facilitated the   process of amnestying former guerrillas" (Leahy, 2009) integrating these men   into the republic's security forces, one of the most secure and well-paid jobs   in the region. With scarce money and the ambition to invest in other structural   areas, these programmes would become difficult to maintain and their   attractiveness would consequently decay.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We shouldn't judge lightly the reasons why this kind of scheme to   combat insurgency ranks is being contemplated by the Kremlin. From an   anthropological perspective, we have to take into account that "the Caucasian   traditions demand that every man should take an active part in providing his   relatives with the necessary resources for living" (Liono, 2000), no matter   what kind of activities he has to do to achieve those precious resources.   Accomplishing this paternalistic obligation is a question of manhood and   honour, two structural values in the North Caucasus societies.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This societal demand on males aligned with "systemic corruption   along with stat despotism and a culture of impunity" (Halbach, 2010: 15) are   fomenting the growth of a "shadow economy" in the North Caucasus. Because this   is a phenomenon as difficult to follow as poorly studied, we have to focus on   its effects instead of looking at its dynamics. According to Arbakhan   Magomedov, "illicit economic activity contributes to a "shadow state",   encourages corruption and undermines the sustainability of economic   development" (Jackson, 2010), which is in so much need in this Russian region.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The apparent merge on less legal economic and political activities   is a heritage of the Russian influence in the region, namely Patrimonialism.   Due to the Patrimonialism influence in the North Caucasus, we have several   local regimes "where the rights of sovereignty and those of ownership blend to   the point of becoming indistinguishable" (Pipes, 1995: 22&#150;23), making it   difficult, if not almost impossible, to reach any kind of endurable economic   society, which could provide economic security and stimulus to a stabilisation   of the situation and an acceleration of the integration.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Douglas Blum, "Putin's policies at home and abroad   reflect a particular conception of the state, one that is historically rooted   with imperial Patrimonialism" (Blum, 2008: 353), in which the value of   entrepreneurship and innovation is substituted by the need to satisfy   clienteles and loyalists. To sum up, "we have few doubts that the national   economic system in Russia fashions a type of patrimonial capitalism, resulting   from the political Patrimonialism existent in the institutions and power   relations in Russia" (Freitas, 2012: 2), with there being a special occurrence   in the North Caucasus. We have to have in mind that all political elites in   public positions need to be confirmed by the Kremlin, and at the same time,   Moscow needs to please local political elites in order to diminish regional   discontentment and resentment.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So far, we can state that all North Caucasus republics have a feeble   "economic society" as their very best scenario, disrupted by a shadow economy,   by continuous ethnic disputes and by insurgency attacks. Even more concerning   is the sheer incapacity of the federal and regional institutions to improve the   already bad situation plundering the economic security of local populations. It   is impossible to assert that there is human security, or even economic   security, when even the traditional threats to the state security are out of   control.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moving forward, it is also important to centre our attention on the   numbers concerning violent insurgency incidents and the death toll resulting   from those incidents. According to a recent report of the Center for Strategic   and International Studies, the number of violent incidents registered in the   first four months of 2010 was 5% lower than the number of violent incidents recorded   last year in the same period: decreasing from 291 violent incidents registered   in 2009 to 283 violent incidents recorded this year (Mendelson, Malarkey and   Moore, 2010: 7).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At a first glance, it appears that the insurgency movement had not   grown but stabilised. However, we should complement this first indicator with a   second one: death toll. In 2010, the decrease in 5% on violent incidents   recorded during the first four months of the year had resulted in a growth of   16% in the number of deaths, compared with the same time period in 2009. The   result of the violent incidents has moved from 183 deaths reported in 2009 to   219 in 2010 (Mendelson, Malarkey and Moore, 2010: 11). From this data,   we can conclude that the number of violent incidents has slightly decreased its   frequency but has grown up in intensity and mortality.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How could such an outcome be related to the economical plight of the   republics in North Caucasus? It is expected that violence grows when the living   conditions are perceivably eroding, especially in societies without job   opportunities, with insufficient and mostly ineffective social services, and   where the central state is seen by a large majority of the ethnic populations   as the enemy. Additionally, we should not forget that men are obliged to   fulfill the basic family needs, even if young men are the most affected group   by unemployment and by the economic continuous underdevelopment. There are no   coincidences when we see that the most subsidised region with the higher rate   of unemployment (Ingushetia) is also the second most deadly (with 290   registered occurrences) of all the subjects composing the North Caucasus   Federal District. Dagestan, the most dangerous and deadliest of the North   Caucasus republics (surpassing 320 confirmed occurrences), is the second most   subsidised republic with the second highest unemployment rate.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reinforcing our argument and understanding the perilous situation is   the "Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin's plan to create 400,000 jobs for   North Caucasus residents over the next ten years" (Vatchagaev, 2010). To the   majority of the political analysts and experts, these statements were made   under the pressure of the growing destabilisation of North Caucasus, at a time   in which the hosting of the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 and of the World   Football Championship in 2018 is getting closer. Putin's declarations were   vague about when the job creation would start and vaguer about which resources   from the federal budget would be allocated to accomplish that<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a>. The importance here   is that Putin knows that North Caucasus' economic plight must be improved in   order to guarantee economic security to local populations and, consequently, to   increase the levels of loyalty to the Kremlin.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once again, it is true that "unemployment and poverty may be factors   in the rise of instability, but they do not explain the complex nature of   violence in the region" (Melvin, 2007: 45), where almost fifty different ethnic   groups cohabit with different and mostly divergent interests. We can even argue   that, to some extent, the prolongation of insurgency could be linked to the   "lack of openness, incompetence and unwillingness to hold a dialogue with   opponents" (Markedonov, 2009: 52), phenomena that have characterised Russian   politics since the first military campaigns launched in Astrakhan in the   sixteenth century<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a>.   From this macro perspective, the unsuccessful economies of the North Caucasus   are just a contributive factor to the resurgence of insurgency. The capacity to   establish an economic society is vital to the transitional path towards   democracy and social stability, but "it is often difficult or impossible to   make systematic statements about the effect of economics in democratization   processes" (Linz and Stepan, 1996: 77). In simpler words, economic dynamics   could produce socio-political phenomena if and when they are related with   several other factors.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the specific case of the North Caucasus, economy surely plays an   important part but is not the sole factor; this is if we take into account that   even during the most peaceful years (2000&#150;2007), the regional economies fared   pretty badly. As we have argued elsewhere,<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> the growth of social and political instability and the rebirth of   ethno-religious nationalisms are the result of a sum of different structure and   conjuncture factors. Economy (and the building of an economic society) is part   of the problem but does not in itself account for the   phenomenon under analysis.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The situation in the North Caucasus will surely be worse after the announced   cuts to the budgetary aid to all North Caucasus republics. At a different level   of analysis, we can conclude that the legacies of the global crises will   decrease the already feeble guarantee of human security in the region. The   expected decline in human security will most probably degenerate in a dangerous   uncertainty, making it more accrued in an already   critical situation. This is pretty much a real picture of what could happen in   the near future in the North Caucasus. As Bronislaw Geremek stated:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It has rightly been said that poverty does not     necessarily generate terrorism, since terrorists also come from among the     privileged. It is nevertheless true that terrorism takes advantage of misery,     knowing that despair creates favourable conditions for terrorist projects and     actions. (Commission on Human Security, 2003: 74)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Loyalty can't be ensured (or even demanded) when the basic needs of   the local populations are not guaranteed. Knowing that "the average all-Russia   rate was 7.3 unemployed in 2006 and 6.1 percent in 2007, &#91;and that&#93; in the   Caucasus the unemployment rate was 13.7 and 11.7<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a>" (Markedonov, 2010: 4),   we better understand the difficulty in ensuring economic security because of a   non-existent economic society. The attractiveness of insurgency groups to local   populations resides on the certainty that some basic needs could be fulfilled   through them. In a region where the shadow economy employs more people than a   regular and legal economy, people will see "shadow economy" as the exit door to   a troubled life. In the case of Ciscaucasian ethnic populations, we also have   to understand that these individuals regard themselves firstly as part of a   community and only after that as singular subjects.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The applicability of human security paradigms is partially   conditioned by this structural precondition (what we could call the   communitarian clause). That is the main reason why this paper has tried to   weave a macro level (economic society) together with a micro level (economic   security). Indeed a human security focus on individuals is important to provide   an alternative level of analysis to questions that historically have proven to   be difficult to account for on a more macro level. Human security offers the   possibility of enlarging the type of analyses and allows taking new and more   accurate conclusions that should be taken into consideration by the Kremlin   when looking at the North Caucasus as an object of political connection.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BAYLIS, John., SMITH,   Steve., and OWENS, Patricia.

Information about this subject is scarce, but a good start to understand   it is: <a href="http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/North_Caucasus_economic_region" target="_blank">http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/North_Caucasus_economic_region</a><br />     <a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" title="">4</a> The main measures appointed to accomplish this goal in Khloponin's   proposal are the "construction of highways across the North Caucasus,   invigorating the development of railroads to the South Caucasus, construction   of ports on the Dagestani coast of the Caspian Sea and creating a transport   corridor to Iran" (Dzutsev, 2010).<br />     <a href="#_ednref5" name="_edn5" title="">5</a> At the end of the 1990s, a series of socio-economic programmes were   approved, such as "Measures for State Support for the Social and Economic   Development in Kabardino-Balkaria or State Support for the Social and Economic   Development in North Ossetia-Alania"<i>. </i>Despite the political intentions,   the majority of the programmes have proven their inefficiency in the production   of concrete results. To read more about this topic, see: Matveeva (1999).<br />     <a href="#_ednref6" name="_edn6" title="">6</a> On 12 August 2010, Ramzan Kadyrov proposed   that only the President of the Russian Federation could use that title,   changing his own title as President of the Chechen republic to Head of the   Chechen republic. Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, President of the Ingushetia republic, had   supported this idea as well as the current President of the   Karachaevo-Cherkessia Republic, Boris Ebzeev. Prior to that, in 2005, Alexander   Dzasokhov had already changed the title of President of the North   Ossetia-Alania republic to Head of the republic. To read more about this   subject, see: <a href="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/regional-bosses-seek-new-title/412431.html" target="_blank">http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/regional-bosses-seek-new-title/412431.html</a><br />     <a href="#_ednref7" name="_edn7" title="">7</a> In a political document presented in Moscow, Vladimir Putin's   grandiose plan to create 400,000 jobs in ten years in the region has been   reviewed to a smaller number of 160,000 jobs. This programme wasn't considered   a priority to the Kremlin endangering its nearby fulfillment. To read more   about this turnover in Vladimir Putin's promises, see: <a href="http://www.jamestown.org/programs/ncw/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=36636&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=423&amp;no_cache=1" target="_blank">http://www.jamestown.org/programs/ncw/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=36636&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=423&amp;no_cache=1</a> <br />     <a href="#_ednref8" name="_edn8" title="">8</a> For a developed reading about the campaigns in the   Caucasus and the r&eacute;sistance of the ethnic groups, see   Gammer (2005).<br />     <a href="#_ednref9" name="_edn9" title="">9</a> Lopes (2010).<br />     <a href="#_ednref10" name="_edn10" title="">10</a> Unemployment rates in Kalmykia, Krasnodar, Rostov and Stavropol are   much lower than the ones registered in the other predominantly non-Russian   republics. The numbers that Markedonov presents in its research results from an   average calculation that includes those four predominantly Russian regions.</font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

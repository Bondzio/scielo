Originally published in French at the Cahier Internatinaux de Sociologie in 1970, the translation of this article, made especially for this dossier, aims to present to the new generations the reflections and research in the field of work sociology of a young student at USP who later became one of the most important authors of the Brazilian social sciences. In this sense, the text has an unparalleled historical value, without losing the current relevance of its problematic. The objective of the article is to elucidate some problems related to the structure of class consciousness of a group of workers present at a 1959 trade union congress. The theoretical reference for this work is Marxism, a perspective that at the time of the research was unaware of the academic milieu.

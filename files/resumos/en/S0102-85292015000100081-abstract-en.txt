This study aims to understand the recent Brazilian foreign policy towards China and the BRICS. Perceptions, expectations and Brazil's projects to China and the BRICS are analyzed as well as discussed the results obtained by means of bilateral and multilateral negotiations between Brazil, China and the BRICS at the end of bilateral and multilateral meetings in Brasilia and Fortaleza, in July 2014. The questions that motivate this article are related to the ways public and private Brazilian agents are adapting to China's presence and seizing the opportunities created by the BRICS and how they conform to Brazilian's political and economic interests.

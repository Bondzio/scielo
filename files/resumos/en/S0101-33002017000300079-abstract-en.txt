ABSTRACT The paper addresses the current Brazilian political crisis. It first discusses the return to traditional interpretations that see the combination between a presidential regime and a multiparty system as the main cause of the crisis. The paper criticizes this view and reasserts the more positive view about the Brazilian political system that merged from more recent scholarly work. As a conclusion, the paper notes the importance political strategies played in the current political crisis.

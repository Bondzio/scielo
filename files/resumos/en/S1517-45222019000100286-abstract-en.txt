Abstract This is a critical review of the work História de vida vivenciada e história de vida narrada: Gestalt e estrutura de autoapresentações biográficas by the German sociologist Gabriele Rosenthal, translated and released in Brazil in 2017. The focus is put on the intellectual endeavor undertaken by the author to locate life histories and biographical narratives within the epistemological, theoretical, methodological horizons, and also in the scope of sociological debates such as those involving individual and society or objectivity and subjectivity. In doing so, we aim at situating the work in the scenario of Brazilian social sciences.

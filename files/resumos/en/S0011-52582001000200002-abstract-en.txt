This article analyzes the building of professionalism among members of the São Paulo State Supreme Court, focusing on their social profile and career patterns as related to the ideas expressed by associate justices in the journals Revista dos Tribunais from 1912 to 1978 and Revista de Jurisprudência do Tribunal de Justiça do Estado de São Paulo from 1967 to 1997. The objective is to assess identity trends in São Paulo judges over the course of the 20th century, using discourse analysis. The study follows the social morphology of judges beginning with the creation of the São Paulo Court of Appeals in 1873, analyzing whether there is a causal nexus between the groups profile and predominant ideology.

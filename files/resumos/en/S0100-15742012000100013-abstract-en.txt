This paper is aimed at construing the subject of education in some writings by Rousseau. Pursuant to the bibliography about the theme, this analysis focuses on how Rousseau understands education, mainly in Projet pour l'éducation de M. de Sainte-Marie, written early in the 40's of century XVIII, on account of the preceptor occupation held by the philosopher in 1740. Accordingly, one may construe that, in such writing, Rousseau establishes comments and critical considerations about the teaching practices then in force, imparting recommendations and drawing pedagogical suggestions for children education. In that case, it would be about a home teaching. In this paper, we have tried to compare such perspective with the proposals posed by Rousseau, with regard to public education. To such effects, we have tried to construe the educational respects contained in the entry that Rousseau wrote in 1755 to the French Encyclopedie under the headline Economy (moral and political). Furthermore, we have tried to identify the education theme in Considérations sur le gouvernement de Pologne et sur sa reformation projetée, written in 1771.

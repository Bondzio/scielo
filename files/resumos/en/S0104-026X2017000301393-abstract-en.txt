Abstract: In this text, it is intended to highlight the main issues regarding gender relations in cinema, presenting a critical analysis of women's participation, in different roles, both in acting and in the cinematographic direction. The feminist critique of cinema also takes into account the expectations of the public in a historical-social context, and contributes to the reflection on the resistance posture of some filmmakers. Also highlighted are the relationships between women and filmmaking in Brazil in the 60s, 70s and 80s.

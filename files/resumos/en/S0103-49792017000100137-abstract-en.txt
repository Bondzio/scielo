Contemporary Latin American societies have been pressured by conflicts between multiple views about the articulation between economic growth and social policies. This article presents the analysis of interpretive frameworks that, from the constructivist perspective, permit to deepen the symbolic and representative dimension of the policies. From the theoretical reflections and analyses about the visions of social protection in parliamentary discussions, in the case of Chile, the purpose of this study is to bring a perspective of analysis that permits to inquire about the processes social policies change. In addition, this study aims to demonstrate how the axis, in the ideas, offers a better comprehension of the stability and change of social policies.

The main goal of this text is to identify which migrant minority groups are in a less advantageous situation in the Brazilian labor market when compared to the &#8220;majoritarian&#8221; group. The results show that the disadvantages of the Black Brazilians in relation to the White Brazilians are lesser than those affecting Bolivians, Paraguayans, Peruvians and Uruguayans. However, when one proceeds to an analysis by region, the negative impact of color/race is stronger in Sao Paulo and in the Amazon. On the contrary, in the states of Paran&#225; and Rio Grande do Sul, the negative effect is respectively greater for the ethnic-national groups of Paraguayans and Uruguayans.

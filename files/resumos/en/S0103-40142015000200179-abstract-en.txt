The decision process, outlined in the classic pyramid shape, the base starts with data collection to apply in hydrological sciences, towards the top where a political decision concluded. The message of the article is that scientific knowledge generated provides the support for the water management model practiced in Brazil. Challenges in the pursuit of new knowledge to manage the dynamics of the uses of water resource discussed.

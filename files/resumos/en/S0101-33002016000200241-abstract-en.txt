ABSTRACT Various historical and sociological studies focusing on the relationship between gender and art show that women&#8217;s participation in the Western art market, although it has increased, continues to represent a minority. However, the Brazilian case proves to be something of an exception, in that women artists occupy positions of prestige in local and international rankings. This article examines the specificities of the Brazilian art system, which have enabled certain female artists to gain national and international recognition, an extraordinary feat when contrasted with other international contexts.

Considering the various existing interpretations around the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC), this paper attempts to identify its arrangements in the creation of jobs, especially emphasizing the construction market, promoted by Minha Casa, Minha Vida program. Thus, we organized data collection on the measures and actions proposed by the PAC during the Lula government and during the Rousseff administration, and we analyzed of the reports of the Federal Courts of Accounts (TCU). Similarly, we carried out desk reviews on the websites of the Ministries of Planning and Finance and a few interviews with construction workers. Data were treated with inspiration of economic sociology, a discipline that considers the whole market is a social construction. In the case analyzed here, the labor market is the result of a social construction, more specifically the construction labor market, since it is the result of various actors and institutions engaged in the promotion of the PAC, such as the state, contractors, unions, pension funds, etc. Moreover, conflicts arising from this social construction were identified.

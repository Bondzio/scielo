Abstract This study discusses the issue of scientific bricolage in education research, raising reflections based on the experience of post-graduate students. This approach takes into account the diligence, complexity and interdisciplinarity aspects of the production of scientific knowledge on teacher training. This discussion was supported by the theoretical-methodological framework and the analysis of data originating from qualitative research. Semi-structured interviews were used as the main technique. We noticed that interviewees conceive scientific bricolage as a challenge and at the same time as an alternative that promotes researcher creativity. They understand that to become a bricoleur scientist demands time, diligence and thorough analysis.

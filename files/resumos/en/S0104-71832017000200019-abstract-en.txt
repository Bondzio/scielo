Abstract: This paper combines interests on human-animal relations with those from anthropological research in cyberculture. Besides, it is a reflection on the redefinitions of culture from the information and computing technologies, and its close articulation with the production order and control of life. Moreover, these themes are based on the results of an ethnographic research in which I followed the implementation of a new methodology of action against the Aedes aegypti in a capital of Northeast Brazil, based on technologies for georeferencing of risk areas. Furthermore, my goal is to show how mosquitoes and people have their lives crossed, produced and governed locally by means of the increasingly ubiquitous and pervasive presence of global infrastructures, such as biology, chemistry and particularly new digital technologies.

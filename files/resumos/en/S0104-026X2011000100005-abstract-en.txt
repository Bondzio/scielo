Since the beginning of the 20th century, the habit of going to the beach allowed for the progressive revelation of the bodies of women, men, and children in Rio Grande do Sul (Brasil). Women were the main targets of advertisements for hygiene and pharmaceutical products, cosmetics, and fashion. During the 1930s, a wide variety of such products was advertised in the Revista do Globo magazine. With the aim of satisfying new feminine desires through new products,these advertisements allow for a historical analysis of the representation of the modern woman, especially the birth of a new feminine body. This article discusses the changes in the representation of women, during the 1930s, based on the advertisements which appeared in the most widely read magazine in the state of Rio Grande do Sul at the time.

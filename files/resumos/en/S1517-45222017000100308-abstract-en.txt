Abstract This article discusses the issue of academic internationalization, by analyzing the mobility of students, professors and researchers toward the universities and research centers abroad, where exceptional technical competence and high quality infrastructure are found for obtaining post-graduate education and research training. It analyses the results of a study carried out involving Brazilian grantees from Capes and CNPq in the areas of Computer Science, Physics/Astronomy and Economics, who conducted full doctorate, sandwich doctorate and post-doctorate in the United States, France and Britain, between 1996 and 2007. Findings suggest that Brazil does not suffer substantial brain drain, since the predominant movement is related to circulation, with the return to the country after the end of the proposed activities abroad. Although the destinations consist of environments that foster the contact with various forms of knowledge production, also providing familiarity with other aspects related to the research practice, following the return to Brazil, the place of research activities practically does not differ with respect to the national pattern, being basically the academic institutions.

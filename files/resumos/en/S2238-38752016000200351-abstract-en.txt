Abstract This article argues for the need to reconsider and reframe the debate on the interpretation and validity of Max Weber's theory of social classes in Brazil. Countering its reduction to the condition of a historical precursor, the study highlights the differences between the two versions of his theory of stratification in Economy and Society and describes its problematic reception in the Brazilian academic context. Starting from a critique of the bias contained in these interpretations, the article presents its current revival in the German sociological debate with na emphasis on the work of M. Rainer Lepsius aiming to stimulate a diversification and deepening of the theoretical reflection on social classes.

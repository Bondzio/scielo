Small community administrations and large consumers of water coexist in the Brazilian rural area. In recent years, community regulation of resources and the large consumer enterprises have entered into confrontation because of water, forcing a reflection upon the logic of the uses and dialogues between the apparent irrationality of rural populations and the development proposals. This article analyzes the lack of synchronization between those logics and perspectives, analyzing the case of high Jequitinhonha, in the Northeast of Minas Gerais. The article initially comments on the recent and growing emergence of water scarcity and how this shortage tends to result in conflict and legislation. Then, the regulation of such shortage is discussed _ which consolidated in the Brazilian water legislation. Following that, the article analyzes the usual water tariffs currently collected in the rural communities of the Jequitinhonha Valley in Minas Gerais, and, finally, it contrasts the usual regulations with the water legislation, analyzing the small consumers' absence in the construction of the agencies and in the exercise of legislation.

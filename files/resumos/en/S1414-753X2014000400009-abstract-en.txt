In past decades, disasters have increased in number and intensity. Humanitarian organizations have looked for approaches to prevent and to prepare for disasters. This situation requires the study of previous disasters so that decisions can target the main vulnerabilities. The purpose of this paper is to assist policies for prevention and preparedness through training programs for disaster preparation in Brazil considering the profile of the populations affected by disasters. Literature reviews of vulnerability studies and training methods focused on natural disasters prevention are conducted, and a statistical analysis of data on victims of natural disasters in four Brazilian states is carried out. Finally, training methods are discussed according to the vulnerabilities identified in the study. The conclusions note training programs and methods that should be more effective and targeted in Brazil. The findings can assist disaster mitigation and preparedness in the states studied.

This article examines the possibility of criticisms based on post-structuralist approaches in International Relations. In this sense, it offers a broad view about the use of post-structuralism in this knowledge field focusing on the approach of Robert Walker and his criticisms on the mainstream currents. In line with the authorÂ´s relativistic view, it calls attention to the fact that any effort of relativization undertook by Post-Structuralism requires the intrinsic acceptance of previously established elements immune to this relativization. Following that, the article presents two instruments used in this theoretical perspective: deconstruction and transvaluation. From these two concepts, it elaborates on the possibilities of critical perspectives supported by Post-Structuralism. Finally, the article concludes that the repetition of the paradigm to be deconstructed ought to be considered one of the possible forms of criticism, according to the assumptions of the theoretical approach under consideration.

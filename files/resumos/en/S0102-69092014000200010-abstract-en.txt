The article discusses the constitution of the field of political memory. Discussing initially Halbawchs' perspective on social memory, it deals with authors such Bourdieu and Habermas in order to address the idea of a field of political memory. The author identifies two moments of inflection in the constitution of such field. The first moment, represented by authors such Nora and Anderson, is a moment in which the political memory is part of state processes of construction of a national memory. The second moment has as reference mainly the context of Latin America post dictatorships. In its discussion, the autonomization of the field is examined from themes such as those of the agents, the supports, and the conflicts of memories.

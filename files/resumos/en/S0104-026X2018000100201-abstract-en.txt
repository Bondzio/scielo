Abstract: In this work I reflect on the relationship between science, gender and feminism. For this, I pursue similarities between the major group of researchers in the field of gender and science known as &#8220;feminist biologists&#8221;, and the interdisciplinary international network of &#8220;feminist neuroscientists&#8221;, established in 2010, called NeuroGenderings. The goal of NeuroGenderings is to bring a critical feminist perspective to recent studies on the brain, especially those looking for differences between men and women. The neurofeminists are engaged in producing a situated neuroscience, unapologetically feminist, thus offering relevant analytical material to reflect on the disputed ideals of scientificity present in the idea of a feminist neuroscience.

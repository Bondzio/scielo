In a scenario of urban expansion and precariousness, urban green areas act as mitigators of environmental and health problems. The aim of this research is to analyse the management of green areas in the city of SÃ£o Paulo and advances in terms of sustainability. The research involved a literature review, documental research, interviews with the key actors and an analysis model. The government possesses the institutional and legal structure to undertake environmental actions and there is funding and mechanisms to enforce social participation. In the last decade there have been several advances relating to green areas, such as the creation of new parks. However, planning procedures need to be strengthened. In addition, there must be monitoring of actions taken and incentives must be created so that private green areas are maintained. Stronger integration of the green areas policy with other urban policies is needed, as is the case in countries such as Germany.

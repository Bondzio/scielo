Abstract: We analyzed the efficiency and the presence of clusters in the soybean complex future contracts (soybean, soybean meal and soybean oil) traded in the following future markets: Argentina (MTB), Brazil (BVMF), China (DCE), India (NCD), Japan (TKT), US (CBT) and South-Africa (SAF). Based on the metrics obtained by Euclidian distances of variance ratios, similar dependencies were found for all markets. The results suggest informational efficiency spread. Therefore, agents shall maintain perceptions over several international markets, given the interdependence found for prices in separate future markets.

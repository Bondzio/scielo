Abstract: The objective of this article is to propose, through bibliographical research, a discussion about which are the systemic and cultural mechanisms that promote the rape culture while protecting the rapist and canceling out the victim&#8217;s right. In a focusing sexual violence against the woman, we seek to observe which are the forms of symbolic violence which result in this kind of de violence. The idea is to deconstruct the popular, mythical, image of both victims and perpetrators, and, in doing so, clarifying our concept of rape. Once we clarify the status of both victims and perpetrators, we will be able to demonstrate how rape is above all one of the most widespread forms of gender violence.

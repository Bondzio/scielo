Abstract The article deals with gender relations in Physical Education classes in Early Childhood Education. The methodology involves performing class observations and interviews with a male teacher and a female teacher, who teach at public schools in a municipality of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, SP, Brazil. Expectations and teachers incentives, when expressed in a polarized manner, produce gender inequalities. Less polarized interventions produced less hierarchical and unequal gender relations, forming boys and girls as being capable of learning and experiencing the body and gestures in a broad and diversified way.

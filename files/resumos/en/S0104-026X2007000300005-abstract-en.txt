Gender discrimination has been discussed in several academic ambits and also recognized by the States. One of the main goals of the agenda that crosse national, regional and local dimensions consists in developing equal education between men and women. It is known that today women can access to a better education than in the past, however, as higher skills are required in technology or knowledge development, fewer women are enrolled . Our investigation intents to prove that some gender indicators may be connected according with the scientific productive process of the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México (UAEM). We believe that scientific productive process of the UAEM should be part of the institutional strategies to result in equal treatment for men and women. The methodology implemented is the analysis of descriptive strategy, trying to obtain data evaluation regarding the academic development of the UAEM from 2003. Also a quality study should be used to know the perception of success, focused on the public recognition from institution investigators. We based this report in the interviews made to four women and four men, who belong to different disciplines of investigations, aged from 30 to 45 years old.

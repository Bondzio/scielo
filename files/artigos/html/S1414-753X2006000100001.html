The former emphasizes    the positive role of local communities and sees law enforcement programs as,    at least potentially, counterproductive to environmental policy. While this    perception fails to take the rule of law seriously, it shows the importance    of local arrangements for sustainable use of forests. On the other hand, there    is a view of deforestation that defines it only in juridical terms as 'illegal    logging', without taking into account the variety and complexity of social problems    at local level. The paper reviews some of the ways social sciences help us to    overcome the limitations of both views. However, it also points at an issue    that has not been sufficiently addressed by social disciplines: the question    of local democracy. While most observers agree on the need of democratic institutions    at the local level, there is not enough research and deliberation on the social    conditions that make those institutions possible. This is a challenge for social    sciences, due to the growing complexity of rural societies, a complexity that    includes <I>inter alia</I> conflicts between owners and non-owners of natural    resources, as well as the presence of 'external' social actors such as NGOs.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Keywords: </B>Illegal logging, common property    resources, deforestation, Mexico, local government, environmental crime. </font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>RESUMO</B> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">O artigo aborda duas vis&otilde;es importantes    sobre a <I>"extra&ccedil;&atilde;o ilegal de madeira"</I>: a perspectiva    "comunit&aacute;ria" e a perspectiva "legalista". A primeira    enfatiza o papel positivo de comunidades locais e v&ecirc; os programas de aplica&ccedil;&atilde;o    da lei, pelo menos potencialmente, como contraproducentes para as pol&iacute;ticas    ambientais. Embora esta perspectiva n&atilde;o leve a s&eacute;rio o poder da    lei, ela mostra a import&acirc;ncia dos acordos locais para o uso sustent&aacute;vel    das florestas. Por outro lado, h&aacute; uma vis&atilde;o do desmatamento que    o define apenas em termos judiciais como "extra&ccedil;&atilde;o ilegal    de madeira", sem levar em conta a variedade e complexidade dos problemas    sociais no n&iacute;vel local. O artigo rev&ecirc; algumas das maneiras pelas    quais as ci&ecirc;ncias sociais nos auxiliam na supera&ccedil;&atilde;o dos    limites de ambas as vis&otilde;es. Entretanto, o artigo tamb&eacute;m trata    de uma quest&atilde;o que n&atilde;o tem sido suficientemente discutida pelas    disciplinas sociais: a quest&atilde;o da democracia local. Enquanto a maioria    dos observadores concorda com a necessidade de institui&ccedil;&otilde;es democr&aacute;ticas    no n&iacute;vel local, n&atilde;o h&aacute; pesquisa suficiente nem delibera&ccedil;&otilde;es    sobre as condi&ccedil;&otilde;es sociais que tornam estas institui&ccedil;&otilde;es    poss&iacute;veis.

On the one hand, a legalistic view (that at its worst can be characterized as    legal fetishism) uses the language of the law to condemn those practices and    puts the law above all other consideration. On the other hand, communitarian    views put the emphasis on the conditions under which members of local communities    engage in logging practices, and tend to avoid any definition of those practices    that can imply 'blaming the victims'; the very notion of 'illegal logging' is    just one of those definitions. From a legalistic point of view, the law should    be enforced by a strong national government, against anyone who misuses natural    resources such as forests, regardless of the 'reasons' that they may have at    a local level. From a communitarian point of view regulation of natural resources    should be left to the local community. National institutions (and especially    the legal system) are seen as illegitimate encroachments into the only true    space for democracy and the rule of law: the local community. These are indeed    extreme views, but it is my impression that too many observers are close to    one of them. In this paper, I argue for the need to transcend this dichotomy    and I consider some of the contributions and the limitations of social sciences    for this task. I take as a reference the case of Mexico, where peasant communities    own and control more than two thirds of the country's forests.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">My main argument in this paper is that the social    sciences can play a mayor role in assisting our understanding of deforestation    and above all, can help us to find a way out of the dilemma between legalism    and communitarianism. At the same time, I point to an issue upon which the social    sciences are still far from providing us with secure answers: the means by which    democratic institutions are created at the local level for the sustainable use    of forests.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>DIFFERENT ECONOMIC PROCESSES, ONE SINGLE LEGAL    CATEGORY</B> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is an obvious contribution of social sciences    to the understanding of deforestation. It refers to the empirical demonstration    that behind the phrase illegal logging one can find a wide variety of economic    processes. 'Logging' in the sense of transforming trees into wood for some economic    purpose, is by no means the only activity that threatens forests. In the case    of Mexico, and this applies to many other countries, deforestation takes pace    mainly through three different categories of practices: Unsustainable forestry,    the conversion of forested areas into agriculture, and the intensification of    certain practices associated with traditional rural society. Although we can    find situations in which all three of these categories occur, it is important    to recognize their differences because they are part of different economic processes.    Let us summarize the context of each of these processes for the case of Mexico.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unsustainable forestry, as the extraction of    timber beyond the rate of renewal, is a well-known cause of deforestation. Misconceived    and erratic government policies have played a mayor role in encouraging unsustainable    forestry. For most of the twentieth century, the primary way in which the Mexican    government tried to avoid the destruction of forests was by establishing <I>vedas</I>    (i.e. moratoria upon logging). This of course created a black market for forest    products and prevented the development of professional skills among the owners    of forests and forest resources. Moreover, when forest projects were approved,    permits were given not to the owners of those forests but to private or state    owned corporations. Although more than three fourths of Mexico's forests are    the common property of agrarian communities (<I>ejidos</I> and <I>comunidades</I>),    the communities were usually only able to collect a small rent for allowing    those corporations to use their forests. In the late 1980s, government policies    began to promote forestry projects conducted directly by the owners of the forests.    Thus, in many regions of the country they have just begun to engage directly    in the use of their own forests. The learning process is only beginning and    there are still serious problems with community forestry, but most scholars    agree that sustainable use of the forest by the owners is a better alternative    than just making all logging illegal. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second category of practices that lead to    deforestation is the conversion of forests into agricultural areas. In fact,    this has been the major cause of deforestation in many countries like Mexico.    Although available data are extremely scarce, there is general agreement that    much more tropical forest has been lost to agriculture and cattle raising than    to forestry. The causes for this 'change of land use' are multiple, including    encouragement by fundamentally misguided public policies. One of the worst mistakes    of agricultural policy of the last four decades is the principle of "beneficial    use," based upon the belief that land in the tropics would invariably be    more productive without its native vegetation. Let us point at some of the most    salient features of those policies:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Peasants' property rights over forests were    protected only if they converted them into agricultural production.    <br>   2. Colonization policies populated the tropics with peasants with no previous    experience in the management of these fragile ecosystems.    <br>   3. Public loans were available for cattle raising, even in natural protected    areas.    <br>   4. Huge agricultural projects were intended to profit from the supposed fertility    of land in the tropics (TUDELA, 1988). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many of those policies were still in effect during    the 1980s, so it is not surprising that many rural communities still wish to    transform their forested areas to agricultural and/or livestock uses. This happens    particularly where there is no timber with significant economic value as in    the seasonally dry forest type (the <I>selva baja caducif&oacute;lia</I>) and    residents have not developed the ability to make a sustainable use of the resources    of the forested areas. In all of these cases, peasants do not take advantage    of the forest. They simply remove it because it is an obstacle to short-term    profitable activities. In spite of recent efforts (SEMARNAP, 2000; GIUGALE et    al, 2001) there is still a long way to go before the inertia of many decades    of wrong-headed policies can be offset by new policies. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The third category of practices that lead to    deforestation is associated with certain traditions in rural life. The domestic    use of wood as fuel, overgrazing in forested areas, and the use of fire in 'swidden'    agricultural systems, are some of the traditions that pose a threat to tropical    ecosystems. The impact of the last of these may depend not on how carefully    or recklessly fire is used, but also on climatic conditions. Mexico had a very    dry year in 1998, and fire became the leading cause of forest degradation in    that year (SEMARNAP, 2000).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This brief account does not try to cover all    the different processes that lead to deforestation. Talking about local processes    does not mean locating 'causes' at that level - regional markets and national    policies are frequently the driving forces at work. I only try to illustrate    how different practices can fall into the same legal category. Cutting trees    without a permit (an illegal action) can be part of very different economic    activities. It can be the product of forestry or of agricultural production,    of using the forest illegally versus just destroying it. Also, illegal forest    activities can be related to consumption practices of poor rural societies (e.g.    fuelwood) or to those of affluent urban societies (e.g. the commerce of high    value flora and wildlife species). Finally, such activities can be seen as the    normal way of doing things (mainly by local communities), or as crimes (through    the urban gaze), regardless of the fact that they might be the same from the    point of view of the law. In a very important sense, we can be deceived by the    categories of law. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Certainly, there are situations in which enforcing    the law against those responsible for deforestation is just a matter of 'political    will', and optimal results can be achieved. In fact, some efforts have been    made in Mexico to 'map out' the predominant activities leading to deforestation    in the different regions where intense deforestation processes occur (PROFEPA,    1998). Although they are only a preliminary basis for the search for much more    robust information, these efforts can help to design different enforcement strategies.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However, once we recognize the variety and the    complexity of the social processes behind deforestation, the law itself becomes    problematic. Apparently, the 'distance' between law and social reality is so    large that we should have to abandon a legal perspective in favor of that of    another discipline or a combination of disciplines. It is only through a socio-legal    approach that we can fully understand the nature of the problems at hand. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>THE ROLE OF LAW IN SOCIETY AND THE MEANING    OF ILLEGALITY</B></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I use the word socio-legal research in a very    broad sense, in order to include every analysis that looks at the meaning and    the role of law for the organization of society. Rather than a unified discipline,    it is a field in which many disciplines and perspectives converge. Even if there    is nothing close to an academic community that share basic tenets, there is    a vast literature that documents and reflects upon the relevance of law in society.    There is nothing in this literature like a 'general theory of illegality' that    we could use in order to understand illegal logging. Therefore, we have to resort    to rather general ideas about law and society. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Although the contributions of socio-legal    studies are extremely diverse, they help us to see law as performing two basic,    and by no means contradictory, functions in society. On the one hand, law brings    about what mainstream sociology calls the 'stabilization of expectations' -    a function that lends itself to pragmatic analysis. On the other hand, law provides    social actors with a series of categories that serve as representations of social    relations which in turn inspire interpretive or hermeneutic approaches, i.e.    those that try to understand the meaning that social actors ascribe to the situations    they confront. There are substantial differences between these two aproaches    to the law, but taken together they convey what we can learn about the role    of law in society from the social sciences - i. e. from that intellectual project    that tries to go beyond metaphysics on the one side and common sense on the    other. From abstract theories to case studies, socio-legal research teaches    us that in modern societies, social relations cannot be maintained if they are    not, at the same time, legal relations. Although there is always the risk of    believing that law 'creates' society, it is possible to say that, at least in    modernity, society cannot reproduce itself without a legal system. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pragmatic analyses tend to see social action    as guided by some form of rational calculation, based on the knowledge of legal    rules and on the expectation that they will also guide the behavior of others.    The 'Law and Economics' movement can be considered as one example of this kind    of approach (POSNER, 1995). However, those analyses take for granted that legal    rules will be enforced when violations occur. Since this is not the case when    we talk about illegal logging, they are not very useful for understanding it.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no doubt that law is made up of categories    that provide definitions of the world, its inhabitants, and the relations between    them. This is why hermeneutic analyses can be very helpful for our purpose:    they look at the way legal categories become part of people's definition of    their situation, as well as the situation of others, even when one of them is    described as being 'outside' the law. Legal categories transform humans into    citizens (and, of course, non-citizens), forests into natural resources, land    into property, and so on. In fact, legal categories are so powerful, that it    takes some intellectual effort to analyze social relations without using them.    Very often, we do not realize that we define a situation through concepts that    only make sense within the realm of the law. For example, in most contexts,    saying 'I am an Italian', can mean the same as 'I am an Italian citizen'. However,    when we come to examine the question of citizenship from a socio-legal perspective,    the distinction between identity and citizenship is essential. One has to differentiate    between the experience of belonging to a national community, i.e. a complex    situation that involves a multiplicity of elements, and even mixed feelings,    on the one hand, and citizenship as a legal category, which does not have to    correspond to any particular form of experience. It is a way of construing individuals    from the perspective of the legal system. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The very idea of 'illegal logging' is a good    example of this. At its worst, it is a typical example of 'seeing like a state'    (SCOTT, 1999). There is not one specific form of logging that can be said to    be intrinsically illegal, thus it is not difficult to recognize that it is solely    in the legal system where certain practices become illegal -or legal. However,    keeping this in mind in a systematic way is far more difficult. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By the same token, unless one thinks that lawmakers    never make mistakes, it should be obvious that not every form of logging that    is declared illegal will be a major cause of deforestation, and similarly, that    not every form of legal logging is sustainable. The main problem with looking    at society through legal categories is the risk of falling into a scheme that    separates the law, on the one hand, and social 'reality' on the other. In that    scheme, law must be outside reality, it would only exist as our own frustrated    expectation of what should be and is not. It is perfectly correct for us to    denounce practices that contradict legal norms in which we believe. But it is    important to recognize that, in doing this, we are talking within the legal    system. Every time we say 'this is illegal' and are listened to by a socially    significant actor, even if we are not before a court, we are embracing one version    of the law, when in fact there are many of them. And if we want to understand    the ways different versions of the law influence the behavior of social actors,    we must at least for a moment take some distance from legal categories. If we    wish to avoid a scheme in which law is not part of reality, we must bracket,    as it were, our own expectations. A recent example of this strategy is the work    of Paul Kahn (KAHN, 1999) although it can certainly be traced back to the origins    of modern social science. Indeed, since the nineteenth century social thinkers    have tried this 'detached' position, although with different implications. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When we stop seeing society through legal categories,    and recognize them as (problematic) objects to be analyzed, we can consider    two basic questions. First, we can distinguish between the nature of social    relations on the one hand (in our case, political and economic relations regarding    forests) and, on the other, the legal categories through which they are represented    and regulated - a perspective that shows us that ambiguity is an essential    feature of law. Second, we can study situations in which illegality appears    as a salient feature, in order to recognize the different, and often contradictory,    legal categories that social actors use to define the situation. Let us consider    these two questions. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When we think about the contrast between social    relations and their legal representation it is clear that while social relations    are fluid, diverse and in constant change, legal categories tend to be permanent,    general and fixed. This generality makes legal categories fundamentally ambivalent.    Thus, the same legal category can be used to represent very different social    processes, as we saw in the case of illegal logging. Conversely, the same set    of social relations can be subject to different legal labels, and we can see    this when we think of people and forests. When a social group exerts some form    of exclusive control over a forested area, two quite different legal categories    can be used: property and sovereignty. When social relations over land are of    an economic nature, we use the legal category of 'property' in order to represent    it, whereas we use the notion of "sovereignty" when we see social    relations of a political nature. In many cases, that distinction is clear enough.    A group of people that controls an area as property owners, can be differentiated    from a wider group that constitutes a political community, that is, a group    that exerts sovereignty over a much larger territory (e.g. a nation-state).    Also, the same forest can be subject to two clearly different social relations    - e.g. it can 'belong' to the Rotary Club and it can 'belong' to the County    of Wartdforshire, <I>at the same time</I>. In that case, it is easy to understand    the distinction between those two forms of belonging and their correspondence    with certain legal categories. However, precisely in the case of forests in    developing countries, there are many cases in which things become much more    uncertain. Frequently, it is not clear whether a local community is only a group    of owners or a political community. Many combinations of economic (property)    rights and political (sovereignty) claims may occur and this is why lack of    clarity and conflict are so frequent in tropical forests. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moreover, it is too frequent that national states    do not even have a legal category that allows indigenous communities to give    any meaning (within the legal system) to their presence in a territory. As long    as those territories are not 'theirs' in any legal sense, they will not be able    to defend themselves in the realm of the law. In the meantime, deep ecologists    in the West can celebrate that those communities belong to the earth, rather    than the opposite. It is interesting to observe that such "ecocentric"    views are not confined to refined urban societies; they are now also present    in many tropical forests around the world, thus bringing additional complexity    to the debate on who owns what. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Certainly, we can examine (and even admire) those    local communities without the categories of the law; anthropologists have done    that successfully for more than a century. But, again, when the issue is 'illegal    logging', we cannot ignore the legal system. Particularly when we want to find    a way of including local communities, we have to face the issue of their legal    status. And we are forced to do so even if we want to transcend the typically    modern public/private dichotomy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In modern states, sovereignty is frequently expressed    at various geographical scales, something that was recognized by the European    constitutional legal tradition even in the heyday of the nation-state    (JELLINECK, 1981). National, sub-national and local authorities claim the political    representation of different levels of social groups. Things become even more    complicated with the emerging claims for a global citizenship that would entitle    members of different national communities to have a voice in the way a particular    forest is being managed. Federal constitutions have been successful in dealing    with this complexity. Far more serious problems arise when it is impossible    to make the distinction between political control of a territory, on the one    hand, and property rights on the other. The consequences of being a political    community, and not only a simple group of property owners, are enormous. It    goes without saying that we are talking about the distinction between a private    and a public sphere, which is one of the fundamental principles of modern society.    Property owners can enjoy the benefits of using a forest, but they are 'subject'    to the legal order of a wider political community. They cannot enforce by themselves    whatever claim they may have over their forest. However, when the group becomes    a political community and creates a local authority, the nature of social relations    is completely different. They have to deal with the responsibilities of government    - collecting taxes, securing the public order, and so on. In fact, some groups    may prefer to be treated as political communities, and even fight for that recognition,    whereas others may choose to be seen as simple landowners. External actors,    such as government agencies, international organizations or even NGOs may also    have different views. Legal definitions are not only varied, they can be the    very source of social conflict. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In fact, the lack of a clear distinction between    owners and rulers is the main problem for forest management in Mexico at present.    Agrarian communities, which are defined as mere owners of forested lands from    a legal perspective, have been forced to act as local governments. As I have    shown elsewhere (Azuela, 1995) <I>ejidos </I>in tropical regions fulfill some    of the functions that local authorities are unable to perform: from policing    to tax collection and the administration of some basic infrastructures. At the    end of this paper, I will consider the problems associated with this lack of    clarity. For the moment, the point is that the distinction between social relations    and their representation through legal categories is more than an academic abstraction.    As long as it is also a field of social conflict, it is important for academic    research to maintain that distinction in order to see the way social actors    mobilize different legal definitions. Also, from a political point of view,    taking that distinction for granted amounts to taking sides <I>a priori</I>,    for an abstract formula, regardless of the way it works in reality. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a second question we can understand    better when we see legal categories as external observers, and it is precisely    the question of illegality. This can be particularly important for the study    of 'illegal logging' where it takes place through practices that are the normal    operation of society at local level and, not surprisingly, are also seen as    legitimate by most local actors. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Illegality has given rise to a vast literature    from at least three different regions of social sciences. Please take note that,    taken as a whole, this phenomenon covers a good part of the human race and its    relation to legal systems. Economics, and more recently a sociological version    of 'new institutionalism', have been concerned with the 'informal sector', which    almost by definition operates outside the law (BRINTON &amp; NEE, 1998). Anthropological    research has produced a huge amount of empirical and theoretical work on 'legal    pluralism', under the idea that rural (pre-modern) societies cannot be ruled    out simply as illegal. Instead, they are seen as having a different type of    legal system from that of modern societies. Similarly, 'irregular human settlements',    a pervasive element in the urbanization of developing countries, is a field    in which the tensions between state legal systems and 'different' local arrangements    have attracted the attention of social scientists. I have dealt with this elsewhere    (AZUELA, 1987) and it is impossible to review all the problems involved here    (for an overview, see FERNANDES &amp; VARLEY, 1998). However, it is worth mentioning    one version of it as it is closely related with communitarianism in a wider    context. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For a good number of scholars in Latin America,    the illegality of low-income urban settlements is not a problem, but a solution.    Wherever neighbors have managed to avoid the enforcement of state law, and have    been able to create their 'alternative' way of settling disputes and create    order at local level, this has fascinated observers. Boaventura de Souza Santos,    by far the most prominent figure in this movement, offers a vivid account of    the way residents of Rio de Janeiro's <I>favelas</I> generate their own legal    system (SANTOS, 1996). By celebrating the existence of an 'alternative' law,    a celebration that has an obvious anti-statist component, this literature has    succeeded in reaffirming what just one version of state law says: that those    settlements are illegal by definition. At the same time, lawyers who are working    to defend residents' interests, and who have managed to stop forced evictions    and to obtain legal recognition for these settlements, have done so by defining    the situation in exactly the opposite terms. Taking as a platform the recognition    of housing as a fundamental right in international law, and arguing that forced    evictions are violations of that fundamental right, several NGOs have conducted    an international campaign against evictions (COHRE, 2001). In many developing    countries this has improved the situation of urban settlers, insofar as it has    provided some security of tenure. In the view of these lawyers, it is the eviction    that can be seen as illegal, not the settlers' possession of the land where    they live. The paradox we want to show here is that, by accepting as valid the    definition of human settlements as illegal, 'progressive' social research gives    a poor service to the cause of those it is supposed to care about. Obviously,    the prejudice against all forms of state legality is the origin of this trap.    But the analytical error resides in taking legal categories as unproblematic.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is an obvious danger of repeating this    mistake in the case of logging. There can be no doubt that communitarianism    has gained momentum in the last two decades. It is the strongest ideology amongst    NGOs involved in rural issues and it permeates the work of many academics. In    this context, a small dose of legal anthropology and a couple of case studies    will apparently be enough to convince ourselves that the very idea of 'illegal    logging' is just a demonization of local practices. In that context, all we    need is to follow whatever local communities decide by whatever procedure, as    if nation-states could be easily 'legislated out'. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The problem with this view is not that it takes    seriously local communities, but that it fails to recognize that, apart from    local interests, there are wider social interests involved in the use of forests,    which can be seen as legitimate by many relevant actors. Unless one believes    that sub-national, national and international (both governmental and non-governmental)    organizations have no role to play in the definition of the way forests are    to be used, one has to recognize the relevance of perceptions and interests    that are defined beyond the local level. In fact, one of the main problems in    designing institutions for sustainable forestry is precisely the need to balance    social interests that are defined at different geographical levels. Before we    turn into the area of social science that offers a perspective for this problem,    let us summarize the main points in this section. Creating some distance from    legal categories is important for three reasons. First, concrete social practices    engaged with forest resources can be seen both as legal or illegal (as can any    form of human action), depending on the side one wants to take. Thus, a universal    definition of illegal logging means taking sides in a number of cases whose    particular conditions remain undetermined. It is only when one wants to influence    a decision that it is necessary to embrace the notion of illegal logging as    a definition of the situation. A universal fight against illegal logging can    be meaningful only for those who want to combat all forms of logging, as well    as for those who are ready to place legal arguments over and above any other    consideration - i.e. for those who want to defend trees or legal rules at any    rate. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, taking distance from the law is still    more important when it is not only social practices, but also the very nature    of social relations that is at stake. This is particularly clear in the tropics,    where the legal status of local communities is unclear. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last, but not least, looking at the law and its    categories as external observers is a fundamental methodological requirement    in order to see the way social actors represent their positions through normative    categories. If law plays any role in social relations, it is because social    actors use its categories to give meaning to what they do and what they are.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp; </p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>COMMON POOL RESOURCES AND NEW INSTITUTIONALISM</B>    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The main source of optimism for the sustainable    management of forests by local communities comes from a movement that, in the    last decade, has used the theoretical platform of 'new institutionalism' in    order to provide an alternative view from that of the 'tragedy of the commons'    (HARDIN, 1968). What has also been called the Institutional Development Analysis    (IDA) framework, is a growing movement of empirical research that has gathered    around the proposals of Elinor Ostrom, Margaret McKean and others. It has established    the basis of a theoretical framework that promises a better understanding of    the conditions under which local communities can use 'common pool resources'    (such as forests or irrigation systems) in a sustainable way. Among the many    merits of this movement, is the fact that it recognizes the need to reconcile    local institutional arrangements with wider institutional contexts - both    at regional and national levels. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the concerns that mobilize scholars for    studying 'the commons' is that many countries have promoted institutional reforms    that suppress communal forms of forest property as part of 'modernization' schemes.    As McKean puts it, in many instances common property regimes have been "legislated    out of existence" (McKEAN, 2000, 34). Adherents to this movement have shown    that in different countries, under certain circumstances, common property can    be the best institutional arrangement for forest management. Although the IDA    framework has an obvious sympathy for common property regimes, there is also    a clear commitment to be more sensitive to empirical findings than to any <I>a    priori</I> ideological position (OSTROM, 1990). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The case of Mexico is particularly interesting    for the IDA framework, because most of its forested land is the common property    of agrarian communities, and this is legally recognized. Moreover, the 'modernization'    of Mexican agrarian law in the early 1990s did not alter this basic feature.    While peasants who are members of an agrarian community are allowed to put their    agricultural land into the market as a result of those reforms, the forested    areas of communities are to be maintained as common property. Communities are    not allowed to subdivide those areas and only in very exceptional cases can    forests become private property. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One the most attractive aspects of the IDA framework    is that it does not see local communities as self-contained social universes    that can succeed isolated from wider political entities. The idea of 'nested    institutions' is central to this theory (OSTROM, 1990) as it recognizes that    national or sub-national governments have a role to play in the maintenance    of common property arrangements at local level. As McKean puts it, "where    local communities' resource claims go unrecognized by national governments,    the best they can hope for is that higher layers of government will overlook    them rather than oppose them" (McKEAN, 2000, 43). This implies not only    a national legal framework, but also the willingness and the capacity of those    higher layers of governments to enforce it. In terms of this theory, this willingness    is essential for common property arrangements, because one of the basic conditions    for its success is that "the criteria for membership in the group of eligible    users of the resource must ... be clear" (McKEAN, 2000: 44). In consequence,    the right of owners to exclude non-owners must also be enforceable. By recognizing    the need for a link between local and central institutions, this theory has    opened the way to pose problems that most communitarian analysis ignores. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The task of building links between the local    dimension and wider spheres meets enormous obstacles. The case of Mexico gives    us good examples of at least three major problems. First, national institutions    are far from being mere enforcers of local communities' rights. Increasingly,    NGOs and public opinion expect to monitor local communities and, if necessary,    enforce the law against them whenever they practice unsustainable forestry.    In this respect, decentralization is not an option that environmental NGOs support.    Moreover, new international actors, both non-governmental and inter-governmental,    are bringing ever more pressure upon the national government to act upon whatever    is seen as 'illegal logging'. Too often, without knowing what happens at local    level, a rock star or a member of the Kennedy family can construct heroes and    villains just by calling a press conference. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, local communities that embark on conservation    or sustainable forestry projects can also have local enemies. Once again, regardless    of how we choose to define them (poachers, invaders, defectors, and so on) there    can be many sources of local conflict over the use of resources. In a Natural    Protected Area like the Lacandona Reserve in Chiapas, the indigenous community    that holds common property rights over the area is the victim of other communities'    problems. Newcomers penetrate the area in order to settle there. Not surprisingly,    the enforcement by national authorities is not an easy task when this happens    just twenty miles away from the stronghold of the Zapatista army. In other regions    of the country, neighbors can find it difficult to accept that members of a    community obtain income from their forests, and may feel tempted to organize    different forms of 'civil resistance' in order to stop logging, without waiting    to see what forest authorities have to say. Last but not least, communities    without strong surveillance mechanisms can be the victims of neighbors who want    to make use of their forests. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, we can also find the opposite situation    when a local community has not found a way of making a sustainable use of its    forests. Thus it is frequent that community leaders protect those of its members    who embark in something that external observers may see as illegal. When this    entails a traditional social practice, like those we described in section 1,    federal law enforcers can encounter a hostile environment, which can range from    kidnapping to assassination. After two inspectors were killed during a visit    to an <I>ejido </I>in the State of Campeche in 1996, the Office of the General    Attorney for Environmental Protection in Mexico instructed inspectors to avoid    'dangerous places', a category that could include a large proportion of the    forests of the whole country. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In short, the use of forests can give rise to    many social conflicts that involve only local actors. That is why they cannot    be addressed solely through the intervention of national authorities. To put    it in its simplest form: while sometimes communities' property rights are too    weak, there are also instances in which they are too strong, i.e. when (non-owners)    local actors are completely deprived of the opportunity to express their views    about the way resources are used in <I>their</I> community. This problem is    usually overlooked by communitarian views, but can be very important when rural    communities grow and so does the division between owners and non-owners.    Citizens in modern societies are allowed to participate in the decisions regarding    the use of <I>other</I> people's land in the communities where they live, through    conventional planning processes. Those places are <I>their</I> communities in    a fundamental political sense. In many countries like Mexico, 'neighbors' of    tropical forests, who are not part of the group that owns them, want to have    a say in the way they are used (AZUELA, 1995). We are talking about local democratic    institutions in which both property rights and citizens' rights are reconciled.    How does this sort of institutional arrangement come about?</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>THE MYSTERY OF LOCAL POLITICAL POWER</B> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have reached a point in which social sciences    do not seem to give us a clear answer. How can we 'build' a local democracy    that gives room to such a complex set of social interests? It is true that the    origin of state institutions has been the subject of great efforts in the field    of historical sociology (ELIAS, 1994; MANN, 1986). However, it is difficult    to find anything specific about the new challenges of the relationship between    people and forests at the local level as well as its articulation with larger    geographical levels. Indeed, most communitarian analyses of deforestation tend    to ignore the complexity of local societies and, in particular, the conflicting    nature of relations between owners and non-owners. There are two aspects    of this complexity. First, the traditional distinction between the urban and    the rural world has been replaced by a complex web of social interests that    operate at different geographical levels. Between big urban centers and small    rural villages there is a setting of small cities and towns. Within an increasingly    complex social geography, at least three groups of actors interact: Regional    authorities (that can include elected legislatures), economic agents (that transform    or simply transport forest products) and citizens (and citizens' organizations)    who want to participate. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Secondly, enforcing the law against 'illegal'    loggers is something that cannot be accomplished by national authorities alone.    Enforcers in countries like Mexico know that it is not just a question of 'getting    there'. Enforcement always implies making decisions about what is legal and    what is illegal and, above all, it frequently entails decisions about what to    do - what kind of sanctions should be imposed and their severity? What    should be done with seized timber? Should permits be temporarily or permanently    suspended? and so on. None of these decisions can be successful if they do not    have a minimum of legitimacy at the local, if not regional level. To the extent    that law is an external rule that is imposed upon a community, that community    will not be part of the social basis that supports the rule of law. Some form    of participation of local actors in the definition of what is legal and what    is illegal seems to be essential to the construction of any legal order. We    are not talking here about some utopian process by which <I>the will</I> of    a community could be easily translated into law. Precisely because the problem    is the multiplicity of local and regional wills, perceptions and interests,    a strong third party is necessary, i.e. a local state that is both democratic    and capable of enforcing what the majority has accepted as legitimate. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even if we convince <I>legalists </I>that local    arrangements are important, they would have to drop the view that legal changes    are all we need to engender new social arrangements. Law can help in the reproduction    of society, but it cannot create it. The consolidation of property (as the operation    of markets) depends on what economic agents do, as much as the consolidation    of democracy depends on how political actors behave. A legal system can be used    to defend interests, but it cannot create them. On the other hand, communitarian    views are often associated with prejudices against state institutions in general.    This is why the communitarian perspective has difficulty recognizing that local    communities must transform themselves into political entities if they are to    handle social conflicts successfully. Wherever there are owners and non-owners    and wherever there are different views of how the forest should be used, the    institutions of political representation become inevitable. Unless we manage    to go beyond those two ideologies, we will be unable to think of a sustainable    use of forests, which is not only efficient but also legitimate. How can this    come about? It is a question that social sciences have yet to answer. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have tried to show that, in order to understand    the relationship between deforestation and the law, it is necessary to transcend    prejudices that dominate the two main ways of looking at deforestation practices.    When looking at those practices from a legal point of view, it is important    to recognize the way society actually works at the local level. Similarly, when    looking at the law from the point of view of local communities, it is necessary    to recognize that there can be legitimate interests apart from those of the    collectivities that own forests. These two steps lead to the construction of    alternative legal arrangements that are capable of recognizing the plurality    of interests around forests and, at the same time, inhibit practices that lead    to deforestation. Strong democratic arrangements at the local level seem indispensable    for the attainment of such an ambitious goal. Nevertheless, while it is easy    to agree with the need for local democracy, it is difficult to specify the way    it comes about. It is my contention that social scientists should make a new    effort in order to elucidate the conditions under which this new form of local    democracy becomes possible.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>REFERENCES</B> </font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">AZUELA, A.

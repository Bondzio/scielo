Abstract Based on the thematization of the Hare Krishna movement and the Rajneesh movement, the present text is a comparative analysis of how both models of Indian religious traditions have dealt with the theme of &#8220;sex&#8221; throughout their processes of diffusion in the Western world. Our purpose is to consider the extent to how each of these religious movements presents their discursive alternatives to the Western religious field that, as far as we know, is heavily operated by an antinomy between sex and religion.

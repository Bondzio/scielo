Abstract: This article seeks to examine how the new global contemporary conditions lead to the redefinition of differences in post-national societies. The coexistence of disparate cultural practices in a single legal framework requires new ways of managing and sharing political space. With the decline of cultural relativism as a persuasive political doctrine, and the advancement of multicultural claims, intellectuals, lawyers and Government officials had the political and theoretical problem of resetting the place of differences within Nations. We propose in this essay to examine the new models of political management and sharing of space developing two main arguments: a) identities are discoursively constructed, and they depend consequently on a cultural mediation work; b) multicultural demands depend on the historical peculiarities of formation of national States and its counterpart, the particular settings of public space.

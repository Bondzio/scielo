The offensive realist theory on defence cooperation under unipolarity aims to understand: (1) the state motivation to cooperate on defence; (2) the independent variables that affect defence cooperation; (3) a comprehensive defence cooperation model that can be replicated in different regions of the world. Under unipolarity, attempts to alter the regional balances of power will be punished by the system. The way states can maximise their power is through defence cooperation, which must provide not only the individual state capacity but also distributive elements that do not trigger an arms race on the regional aspect nor an offshore balancing from the unipole. The theory suggests that new times demand new ways of power maximisation.

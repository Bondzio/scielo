Abstract: Women are the majority both among the students and in the teaching staff at the Argentine universities. However, they appear grouped mainly in certain areas and barely access the higher upper categories. There is a horizontal and a vertical pattern of gender segregation. Our objective is to study the participation of women and to deepen the perception of gender discrimination. Firstly, a descriptive analysis of the faculty of the National University of Salta (UNSa) is carried out. Secondly, the results of a survey applied to the female staff of the Faculty of Engineering of the UNSa are analyzed. There is a low perception and awareness of the problem, especially on the part of the teachers of minor age and they point out certain barriers as the main obstacles in the academic career.

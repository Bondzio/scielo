This article evaluates economic and environmental impacts of Brazilian highway conditions. The economic benefits evaluated were: diesel consumption, travel time and vehicle maintenance; the environmental benefits evaluated were the reduction on negative externalities related to decrease on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Primary computer collected data related to the trucks performances on highways with different infrastructure conditions. The data were derived from 20 trips over 2 routes, each route representative of one of two highway conditions: better or worse (Campo Grande to Santos, and Rondon√≥polis to Campo Grande). The results had confirmed economics and environmental benefits resulting from travel over the better routes.

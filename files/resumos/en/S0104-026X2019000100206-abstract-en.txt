Abstract: This qualitative study aims to identify the meanings attributed to the experience of migration by women in the military context. Using a critical psychosocial approach and particularly gender theories and the theory of social representations, it specifically aims to understand how these experiences contributed to the construction of subjectivities. Through the narration of military women, we concluded that the experience of becoming a woman by herself in an unknown place is full of representations and meanings that reinforce the continuity of a culture of gender subordination, where women remain in powerless positions.

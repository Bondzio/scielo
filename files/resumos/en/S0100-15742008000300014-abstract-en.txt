This article presents a preliminary analysis of PDE (Education Development Plan) that was launched by the Brazilian federal government in April 2007, in order to address some expectations, impasses, and impacts. Much of the uneasiness and doubts we approach arose in the itinerant seminar "The Education Development Plan - PED - under Discussion in SÃ£o Paulo Public Universities", in which specialists from different institutions had the opportunity to debate the plan with those who were responsible for creating and implementing the plan. We have organized the analysis in three parts. In the first part, we discuss some presuppositions of national education funding and show that Brazil can and should invest more resources in order to attain adequate social and educational development. In the second part, we analyze documents of the Ministry of Education evidencing the conceptions on which the PDE is based with regard to funding of the 40 proposed actions. In the third part, the authors take a position on the form of funding adopted and the resources foreseen or allocated to carry out actions. Finally, a series of issues concerning the plan are raised from a propositional perspective.

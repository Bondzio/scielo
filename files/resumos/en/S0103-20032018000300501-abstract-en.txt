Abstract: The objective of this study was to characterize the family´s autopoiesis conservation movement in the agroecosystems of the Sacaí Environmental Complex, Baixo rio Branco, Caracaraí, Roraima, Brazil. The theoretical-methodological framework was based on the real understanding of the paradigm of systemic complexity. For this, it used a family of autopoietic organization analysis from the design of a multiple case study. Interviews with a previous script, census questionnaire, field diaries and photographs were used as evidence collection techniques. Forty-one families participated in this study. The paper revealed the importance of understanding the primary organizational structures in human ecological systems when considering conservation, which are not possible for standardization and replication in their entirety. From the results presented, it can be stated that the Sacaí Environmental Complex, as a result of the recursive process of autopoiesis, at the same time, assumes organization as a nuclear family, troncal extensive family and community extensive family. Thus, the Sacaí Environmental Complex, as an agroecossistemic organization, assumes the multiple possibility of life (re)construction from the family organization as a starting point for the conservation of autopoiesis.

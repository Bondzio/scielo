<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "humanistic"    or "solidarity-based" trend in the Brazilian strategy of international insertion,    adopted after the rise to power of President Lula and considered innovative,    consolidated the objective of prioritizing the South-South axis and can be explained    by domestic, regional, and systemic reasons. This strategy was put into practice    by increasing the international aid granted by Brazil, by transferring resources    and technology and by the emphasis placed on conveying to partner countries    some of the domestic social policies and programmes developed successfully by    the Brazilian government. The aims of this paper are: (a) to look at how this    "humanism" and "solidarity" appeared in the discourse of the Brazilian authorities;    (b) to discuss the reasons for them and their logic in the national, regional,    and systemic dimensions; and (c) to map the initiatives adopted, the preferred    partners and areas, the resources used and the intragovernmental connections    necessary for their implementation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords:</b>    Foreign policy; Brazil; humanistic; solidarity.</font></p> <hr noshade size="1"/>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the end of the    first decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Brazil had attained unprecedented    visibility and prestige in international affairs (Dauvergne and Farias, 2012;    Hurrell, 2008; Rouqui&eacute;, 2008), a position long aspired by the Brazilian    elite (Lima, 2005a). Evidence of this is so plentiful that examples are unnecessary.    Such a shift was made possible by both international and domestic factors.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In such a context,    much has been said and written about the foreign policy put into practice during    the Lula administration (2003-2010): that it was "politically engaged" (<i>engajada</i>)    (Almeida, 2004); that it sought a "sovereign presence" in the world system (Souto    Maior, 2004); that it was based on a search for a new "diplomatic architecture"    (Almeida, 2005); that it followed a strategy of attaining "autonomy through    diversification" [of partners] (Vigevani and Cepaluni, 2007) and that it was    based on a "charismatic diplomacy" that was "impossible to transfer" (Ricupero,    2010), among many other labels and adjectives.<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>    Celso Amorim, Minister of Foreign Affairs during Lula's two terms in office,    said in an interview immediately after his appointment to lead Itamaraty once    again<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a> that the country's    foreign policy would be "lofty and active" (<i>altiva e ativa</i>). In another    interview, towards the end of his eight years as Lula's foreign affairs minister,    Amorim stated that he preferred to label it as "fearless and solidarity-based"    (<i>desassombrada e solid&aacute;ria</i>) (Amorim, 2010).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until quite recently,    few Brazilian foreign policy analysts had stressed the importance that this    emphasis on "humanism" and "solidarity" had on Lula's strategy of international    insertion, even if, as we will see, it was strongly present in public speeches    given both by Lula and Amorim since the very beginning, and even if it was almost    immediately translated into practice. Lima and Hirst (2006: 22), however, state    that the "inclusion of the social agenda as a major topic of foreign affairs    was one of the first and most important innovations".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This new tendency    of the country's foreign policy, regarded as innovative, consolidated the objective    of prioritizing the South-South axis. With this objective, Brazil established    closer ties to countries on the periphery of capitalism, which can be explained    by domestic, regional, and systemic reasons. This strategy was put into practice,    <i>inter alia</i>, by the increase in international aid granted, the transfer    of resources and technology, and the emphasis placed on conveying to partner    countries some of the domestic social policies and programmes developed successfully    by the Brazilian government.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper aims    to analyse this aspect of the country's foreign policy in discourse and in the    analytical and empirical dimensions. In other words, its objectives are: (1)    to look at how this "humanism" and "solidarity" appeared in the discourse of    the Brazilian authorities; (2) to discuss the reasons for them and their logic,    in the national, regional, and systemic dimensions; and (3) to map the initiatives    adopted, the preferred partners and areas, the resources used and the intragovernmental    connections necessary for their implementation. The structure of the paper will    follow these objectives and attempt to unveil both the theory and the practice    of Brazilian self-proclaimed "humanistic" foreign policy during the period 2003-2010.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Rhetoric    of Solidarity and Humanism in Lula's Foreign Policy</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The activism of    Brazilian foreign policy under Lula may be gauged by the intensity of the so-called    presidential diplomacy during his time in office. <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/01t01.jpg">Table    1</a> compares the official presidential trips to foreign countries made by    Cardoso (1995-2002) and by Lula (2003-2010).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whereas Cardoso's    presidential diplomacy had been widely praised in Brazil (Danese, 1999), the    intensity of Lula's personal engagement in international affairs initially surprised    many of his fellow citizens, largely due to prejudice, since the former industrial    worker did not have a university degree and spoke only Portuguese.<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>    As a matter of fact, the comparison presented above not only illustrates the    priority Lula gave to foreign affairs, but also shows that the South-South axis    really became of particular concern during his administration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our objective in    this section is not to present a quantitative analysis or analyse the circumstances    in which Lula and Amorim made reference to their intention to develop foreign    policy strategies based on solidarity and humanism, made clear in their innumerable    public speeches, both abroad and at home. Neither do we intend to perform any    kind of formal discourse analysis. Our goal here is much more modest: to select    and present a few passages in order to show that such a strategy was conceived    since the very beginning of the Lula administration, to illustrate that it was    clearly and frequently presented and to highlight how powerful this rhetoric    was at times. As we will see, the fact that the president could claim, as he    did on several occasions, that he himself had experienced poverty, hunger, exclusion    and migration motivated by economic reasons was not the only reason for which    it was so powerful.<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his inauguration    speech on January 1, 2003, Lula made it clear that the link between domestic    and foreign policies in his government would not just be "developmental". It    must be borne in mind that in Brazil, foreign policy has traditionally been    regarded as an instrument to promote economic development at home. Lima and    Hirst (2006: 21) have also stressed this point: "the government's fight against    poverty and unequal income distribution at home and its assertive and activist    foreign policy can be viewed as two sides of the same coin".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the aforementioned    inaugural speech, Lula called upon the nation to make the "end of hunger a great    national cause", a "crusade". He said, "Our foreign policy will also reflect    the desires that were expressed in the streets. In my government, Brazilian    diplomatic action will be oriented by a humanistic perspective and will be,    above all, an instrument for national development". The main priority was to    build "a continent that is politically stable, prosperous and united, on the    basis of the ideals of democracy and social justice". The country would back    the efforts to make the United Nations and its agencies efficient instruments    for promoting "social and economic development, to fight poverty and inequality".</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are starting      a new chapter in Brazilian History today, not as a submissive nation, (...)      not as an unjust nation, passively watching the suffering of the poorest,      but as a lofty (<i>altiva</i>) and noble nation that will affirm itself courageously      in the world as a nation for all, free from class, ethnic, gender or belief      distinctions.<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a></font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The message Lula    took to Porto Alegre (III World Social Forum) and to Davos (World Economic Forum)    later that same month (January 2003) was not any different: he recognized that    his electoral victory meant hope not only for Brazilians, but also for leftist    forces all over the world. Lula stated that it was no longer possible to carry    on with an economic order that allowed children to starve. "The truth is that    the social problems of the world had never been discussed in Davos", said Lula    in Porto Alegre. Two days later, he said in Davos that "the construction of    a new international economic order, one that is more just and democratic, is    not only an act of generosity, but is also particularly an attitude of political    intelligence". To justify his proposal to create an international fund to fight    poverty and hunger in the third world, Lula stated that "it is necessary to    admit that hunger and poverty are usually [part of] the cultural environment    (<i>caldo de cultura</i>) where fanaticism and intolerance arise". The speech    at Davos was thus concluded: "We urgently need to unite around a world pact    for peace and against hunger. And rest assured that Brazil will do its part".</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lula regarded the    task of convincing leaders, sensitizing audiences and setting the international    agenda as part of his responsibility. This is clear when one looks at his agenda    and reads his speeches. But Lula had more than a moral discourse, personal charm,    charisma and his own life story to support his "crusade". He also insistently    presented Brazilian social policies created or improved by his government, such    as <i>Fome Zero</i> (Zero Hunger) and the conditional cash transfer programme    called <i>Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia</i>, which became the world's greatest programme    of that sort, as best practices to be emulated. In 2011, Lula's former minister,    Jos&eacute; Graziano da Silva, was elected Director-General of the UN Food and    Agriculture Organization (FAO). Lula once said that "Brazil wants to be proud    to be the first country to accomplish all the Millennium Goals established in    Rome".<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a> In fact, Brazil managed    to accomplish the first goal ("to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger") well    before the deadline. But it was not only the domestic policies that were praised    and sold as examples to other developing countries. The social programmes financed    by the IBSA (India, Brazil and South Africa) Forum Fund in non-member countries,    for example, received an award from the UN.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both Lula and Amorim    stressed the "humanistic" spirit that characterized Brazil's mobilization in    the domestic and international spheres on many occasions. According to the rationale    that was being disseminated, "the fight against exclusion and inequality is    not a mere consequence of growth, but its mainspring" (<i>mola mestra</i>).    As Lula had strongly condemned the invasion of Iraq, which took place on March    20, 2003, he said repeatedly that "our war is against hunger and poverty, and    that is the only war that interests us". But perhaps the most striking argument    used by him on countless occasions in his speeches around the world was that    hunger can be considered the most lethal weapon of mass destruction, since it    killed "twenty thousand people a day and eleven children per minute", affecting    nearly one quarter of humanity. The goal of "transforming hunger into a political    issue" became clear and was easily recognizable. "We will not be successful    in the fight against hunger if we do not radically change the standards of international    cooperation. It is necessary to turn the page on the models imposed from abroad".<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a>    "With the IBSA Fund we are proving that it is not necessary to be rich in order    to show solidarity, that it is possible to help without interfering in other    nations' internal affairs".<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rhetoric of    solidarity was also frequently presented as part of a defence of Brazilian national    interests, once defined by Amorim as the well-being of the Brazilian people.    Brazilian diplomatic efforts to liberalize the international commerce of agricultural    goods in multilateral institutions - particularly in the World Trade Organization    (WTO), where the country led the articulation of the G20 in 2003 - were also    linked to the search not only for a more equitable international system, but    also for social justice. As Lula mentioned several times, "there will be no    peace and security [in the world] without economic development and social justice".<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a>    Targeting the heavy subsidies for agriculture practised by the USA and Europe,    both Lula and Amorim emphasised many times that "it cannot be possible that    cows in some developed countries earn more than two dollars a day in subsidies,    while half of the world's population has to survive on less than that".<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a>    In another speech, Lula said that "the sum of resources spent on subsidies for    agriculture is equivalent to six times the yearly additional value necessary    to make the achievement of the Millennium Goals possible. Such a situation must    change".<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a> According to    Amorim,</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(...) for the      first time in the history of trading diplomacy we have managed to put together      [through the G20] two seemingly antagonistic objectives: trade liberalization      and social justice. This has only been possible with this background which,      in a way, President Lula created with his crusade against hunger.<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a></font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lastly, but no    less important, we must mention the relevance and opportuneness of a term/concept    coined by Minister Amorim: "non-indifference". Whereas non-intervention and    the defence of self-determination have been traditional hallmarks of Brazilian    diplomacy, as several analysts have stressed, the new concept "non-indifference"    was first used to justify the Brazilian leadership of MINUSTAH in Haiti, the    UN mission established in 2004 under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter. The term was    later used by Brazilian diplomatic authorities to try to legitimize not only    humanitarian assistance, but also debt relief and technical cooperation with    the official goal of promoting social development in other third world countries.    Just as "the right to intervene" was largely used by the USA in their War against    Terror after the Iraq War, "non-indifference" also legitimized a sort of intervention,    but for the sake of social justice (Lima, 2005b). And in Haiti, Amorim believed    that Brazil was "creating a new paradigm in international cooperation to solve    conflicts. (...) What we desire is that our action in Haiti turns out to be    a model, at this moment in which the UN is undergoing profound transformations".<a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14"><sup>14</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is therefore    possible to say that Lula worked hard in his "crusade" (or "apostolate", as    Amorim once said) to set the international agenda and to disseminate Brazilian    policies, becoming a kind of international policy entrepreneur. And a very successful    one, according to many observers and analysts.<a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a>    But how can one explain such a "crusade"? What are the reasons behind the humanistic    and solidarity-based foreign policy developed by Brazil during Lula's presidency?    We will attempt to answer these questions in the next section.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Domestic, Regional    and Systemic Reasons that Guided Lula's Humanistic Foreign Policy</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the individual,    psychological motivations for launching this innovation in Brazilian foreign    policy could be employed in our search for an explanation, as we saw in the    previous section, in the following discussion we will emphasise the domestic,    regional, and systemic variables.<a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It must be initially    said that, although the Workers' Party's (PT) rule in Brazil and "<i>Lulismo</i>"    have been viewed as "pragmatic" - at least in comparison to other Latin American    left-wing governments that rose to power, in what has been labelled as a "pink    wave" that swept the region in this century's first decade (Panizza, 2006) -    , it is hard to distinguish the political/ideological reasons behind the emergence    of that humanistic trend in Brazilian foreign policy from the more pragmatic    ones. Be that as it may, we should always ask ourselves if there really are    politics without ideology.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lula won the presidential    elections in 2002 after also having disputed the three previous ones. His victory    was possible not only due to a nationwide mass mobilization led by his party    and his charismatic personality. His appeals to social justice during the campaign    were combined with a promise to preserve the orthodoxy of the country's economic    policies in order to calm down the markets and to gain the confidence of the    middle classes. The neoliberal policies of Lula's predecessor, Cardoso, of the    Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), would not be undone at the cost of    instability. Economic orthodoxy may have marked Lula's first term in office,    but as well as departing from the privatizations that took place during the    government of the Social Democrats, the administration also immediately started    putting into practice the long aspired foreign and social policies preached    by the PT.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to official    expectations, these two policies, which were "two sides of the same coin", would    be the trailblazers of the country's project of social and economic transformation.    If social and economic change would inevitably come about slowly, self-esteem    could be quickly induced by the forcefulness of the social justice discourse    and by a renewed appraisal of the country's role in a changing world. The fact    that sustained national economic improvement ensued was due both to external    good fortune (particularly the commodities boom) and the progressive expansion    of the internal market, fuelled by the social policies, successive increases    in the minimum wage, novel forms of access to credit and the creation of millions    of new jobs. Upward social mobility, material improvement and a sense of collective    pride in the country (Anderson, 2011; Burges, 2005) strengthened the leading    role Brazil was playing on several international stages. These were to be compared,    according to the new Brazilian foreign policymakers, to the increased social    inequalities produced during the previous government and the diplomatic fidelity    to the United States, with no visible domestic impact, which was the guideline    of the Social Democrats.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the strategy    of solidarity-based international insertion, stressing the South-South axis,    was domestically produced, legitimized and reinforced by the character of the    Brazilian political leader, by political competition and by the need to produce    economic improvements. The Brazilian economy was among the world's first to    recover after the 2008 Wall Street Crash, which took place during Lula's second    term. Such a performance was attributed, to a large extent, to both foreign    and social policies, as domestic demand kept the machine working and Brazilian    exports were no longer dependent mainly on developed countries (China became    Brazil's main commercial partner in 2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Regional factors    also played an important role, as the new Brazilian foreign policy sought to    reinforce the traditional priority given to South America, treating it as a    renewed priority. However, it quickly became evident that the kind of bold regional    leadership initially preached by Lula and the PT would not work out. As if the    huge regional asymmetries were not enough to make most of the Brazilian initiatives    suspicious, Venezuelan president Hugo Ch&aacute;vez had also begun expanding    his regional ambitions through the ALBA (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas)    and his petro-diplomacy (Burges, 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil's regional    leadership had several interconnected purposes: to transform the open regionalism    of the 1990s into a post-liberal one, which would supposedly promote common    political, strategic and social objectives; to reduce or prevent US hegemony    over the continent; to promote regional trade and the interests of Brazilian    companies (and the Lula government strongly backed the internationalization    of the country's companies); to support, both directly and indirectly, like-minded    political leaders in neighbouring countries; and last but by no means least    - on the contrary - , to make the region a platform for consolidating Brazil    as a global player (Spektor, 2011). According to that rationale, the Brazilian    leadership then had to be based on solidarity and humanism, which also demanded    a willingness on Brazil's part to act as a regional integration paymaster.<a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The global impact    of the September 11, 2001 events is of central importance for understanding    the opportunities provided by the international system for developing the Brazilian    strategies. As the US-led War on Terror strongly promoted a securitization of    the international agenda and made the US concentrate on a different region,    Latin American countries found themselves free to pursue more autonomous objectives.    The mostly ruinous legacy of the neoliberal policies of the 1980s and 1990s    (or at least such a perception) certainly played an important role, as it made    possible the upsurge of the "pink wave" mentioned earlier (Panizza, 2006; Vilas,    2005). The rhetoric of the Brazilian authorities stressing humanism and solidarity,    as well as the policies promoted by the country in both the domestic and international    spheres, helped to revive the North-South divide. The War on Terror was contrasted    with the war against poverty, and the selfish objectives of trade liberalization    and the hegemony of the few developed nations started to be forcefully denounced    in the streets and by dozens of leaders of developing countries.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Traditional Brazilian    ambitions of reforming the institutional structure of the international system,    particularly the UN, where Brazil demands a seat in the Security Council, are    also said by many to be an important motivation for the priority given to the    South-South axis. This is so because the new partners and beneficiaries of the    cooperation Brazil is implementing could lead to greater political support and    possibly new votes in its favour.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 2008 outbreak    of the profound financial crisis that still limits the international impetus    and influence of the developed nations has been interpreted in the periphery    as a sign and an opportunity. The transformation of BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India,    China) from an acronym into a group of emerging countries that endeavour to    coordinate their international positions, and the subsequent expansion to include    South Africa, should be regarded as one of the many manifestations of this perception.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having analysed    the rhetoric of solidarity and humanism in Lula's foreign policy and very briefly    presented the domestic, regional, and systemic reasons that drove such an innovation,    our task in the next section is to discuss how it was translated into practice.</font></p>     ]]></body>

These projects and actions    included: Brazil's methodological transfer of some of its main policies through    the provision of South-South technical cooperation, debt relief for poorer countries    and Brazil's commitment to help countries affected by natural disasters or conflict    by means of international humanitarian assistance. The purpose of this section    is to map these initiatives, the key partners, resources, and intragovernmental    connections necessary for their implementation.<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The policies and    projects in question are considered "humanistic" and "solidarity-based" because,    as stated earlier, they were justified in the Lula government by the sharing    of values and interests with other countries of the South; by the sense of duty    or "moral obligation" to protect individuals from another country; by the guiding    principle of asking no counterpart to these actions from recipient countries;    and by the Brazilian government's involvement in actions that sought to alleviate    people's poverty, hunger and misery. The next subsections will briefly touch    on the priorities, policies, and programmes of the following three areas: (1)    South-South technical cooperation; (2) humanitarian assistance; and (3) financial    cooperation. We will then conclude by presenting the intragovernmental coordination    efforts and structures necessary for implementing these policies and programmes.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before examining    the practice of international solidarity in Lula's foreign policy, however,    another comparative exercise may be useful in order to make the administration's    priorities even clearer. The great emphasis placed by the Lula government on    the "social question" in its international agenda may also be attested by a    content analysis of the bilateral "international acts" signed by Brazil during    2003-2010. Such research is greatly facilitated by the fact that the Itamaraty's    Department of International Acts (Divis&atilde;o de Atos Internacionais) has    a database on its website that enables access to all the acts signed and a search    for specific key words. In this regard, a comparison between the Cardoso (1995-2002)    and Lula (2003-2010) governments is revealing. The aforementioned site has a    register of 845 bilateral acts signed during Cardoso's years in office, a figure    that more than doubled during the following government (1,896 bilateral acts    signed). This difference proves the great international activism of the Lula    administration. For the purposes of this article, however, it is more important    to compare the results of the search for the keyword "social development" in    the text of those agreements. This expression appears in 576 of the bilateral    acts signed during the Cardoso administration (68.2% of the total), whereas    it appears in 1,546 of the 1,896 bilateral acts signed during Lula's government    (81.6%).<a name="top19"></a><a href="#back19"><sup>19</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>South-South    Technical Cooperation During Lula's Government</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The South-South    cooperation is not a new phenomenon, but it has been deeply reformulated and    enhanced in the last decade or so. According to Silva (2010), the motivation    for undertaking this cooperation is to share interests and mutual benefits.    In this sense, the South-South cooperation had an important role during the    Cold War, after the articulation of the Non-Aligned Movement at the Bandung    Conference in 1955, and in the operation of the G77, created in 1964. The oil    crisis, the international recession and the debt crisis in peripheral countries    during the 1970s and 1980s caused a significant reduction in development cooperation,    which affected both North-South and South-South cooperation. Only in the 21<sup>st</sup>    century have we been able to see the South-South cooperation enter a new phase.    According to Silva, several factors contributed to this revival. The rise of    some developing countries through economic growth and social improvements enabled    them to exercise leadership roles in the periphery of capitalism and become    providers of cooperation. The creation of the Millennium Goals in 2000 added    urgency to the problems of the South. Finally, the crisis and the disappointment    with the cooperation initiatives came from the North, which have frequently    ended up with not very encouraging results for the recipient countries, making    the asymmetries of power even more evident and strengthening the dependence    of peripheral countries (Silva, 2010).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The South-South    Technical Cooperation, also known as technical cooperation for development,    or horizontal cooperation, is one of the cooperation modalities delivered by    Brazil.<a name="top20"></a><a href="#back20"><sup>20</sup></a> It was "reinvigorated"    from the beginning of the Lula government, as pointed out by Puente (2010).    This was due to the expansion of relations and to an approximation with the    countries of the periphery, as well as to the growing human and financial resources    allocated to the Brazilian Agency for Cooperation (ABC).<a name="top21"></a><a href="#back21"><sup>21</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following figure    shows the evolution of the ABC's budget from 1995 to 2010. One can see that    from 2004 to 2005 there was a significant budget increase, from nearly US$ 8    million to US$ 37 million (Puente, 2010: 294). One explanation for this sudden    increase was the fact that Brazil has been carrying out cooperation projects    in Haiti, where it leads the UN peacekeeping mission, MINUSTAH, which began    in 2004. In the following years the budget fell in relation to 2005 and increased    again in 2009. Nevertheless, from the last year of Cardoso's presidency (2002)<a name="top22"></a><a href="#back22"><sup>22</sup></a>    and during the Lula administration, the amount of resources allocated to the    ABC increased significantly. Notice, however, that a study conducted by the    ECOSOC and the OECD showed that in 2008 Brazil was only the eighth donor among    developing countries, responsible for just 2.6% of the resources mobilized (apud    Souza, 2012: 90).</font></p>     ]]></body>

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil's performance    as a provider of international humanitarian assistance is based on two complementary    UN General Assembly resolutions: 46/182 and 58/114. The first (46/182), from    1991, sets out the principles that must be observed in providing this sort of    assistance: humanity, neutrality and impartiality. Since the sovereignty of    states must never be violated, humanitarian assistance should be provided only    with the consent of the affected country. The second resolution (58/114), from    2003, emphasises the need for cooperation on humanitarian assistance. It encourages    governments, international organizations, and NGOs to cooperate with the Emergency    Relief Coordination, of the UN Secretary-General, and to follow the resolutions    of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Lula's government,    Brazilian humanitarian assistance went through a growing process of institutionalization    and there was great concern for its operation. This took place after the creation    of the General Coordination for International Action Against Hunger (CGFOME),    linked to the Office of the General Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs    by Decree No. 4759, of June 21, 2003. According to the General Coordinator of    CGFOME, Minister Milton Rond&oacute; Filho, CGFOME was created to be the "external    interface" of the Zero Hunger Programme<a name="top24"></a><a href="#back24"><sup>24</sup></a>,    providing humanitarian assistance and emergency actions on food security.<a name="top25"></a><a href="#back25"><sup>25</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, the Inter-Ministerial    Working Group on Humanitarian Assistance (GTIAHI) was created by a decree published    on June 21, 2006 in order to coordinate the efforts of Brazilian international    humanitarian aid and to formulate a bill that would permanently authorize the    donation of food, medicine and other items from Brazilian public stocks to international    humanitarian actions. Thus, on April 17, 2007 bill n&ordm; 737<a name="top26"></a><a href="#back26"><sup>26</sup></a>    was presented for this purpose, as these donations were being sent by means    of Provisory Measures<a name="top27"></a><a href="#back27"><sup>27</sup></a>,    which authorized the shipments. In addition, in 2009, the first humanitarian    warehouse in Brazil, at the International Airport of Rio de Janeiro, was set    up with the aim of expediting humanitarian assistance.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Humanitarian assistance,    as well as other actions comprising the "humanistic" and "solidarity-based"    trend of Brazilian foreign policy, divides opinion within the country. The Observatory    of the Metropolises, in partnership with other national and international organizations,    conducted a survey in major metropolitan areas of Brazil to understand the exercise    of citizenship in these regions. The survey was also conducted in six other    countries: Canada, the United States, France, Sweden, Spain and Portugal. In    it, respondents were asked about the importance of "helping people around the    world who live in precarious situations". The indicator varies from zero to    seven (seven = Very important; zero = Not important at all) and Brazil came    first in the ranking, with an average of 6.23, followed by Spain, Portugal,    Canada and Sweden (Azevedo; Santos; Ribeiro, 2009: 353). Since only 43% of the    Brazilian population lives in metropolitan areas, the results cannot be extrapolated    to the whole population. Nevertheless, they suggest strong internal support    for the "humanistic" and "solidarity-based" foreign policy actions. On the other    hand, according to Milton Rond&oacute; Filho, coordinator of CGFOME, the opposition    parties have been against the approval of Bill 737/2007. This controversy is    illustrated by the declaration of separate voting by Deputy Fernando Coruja    (PPS - Socialist Popular Party):</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the      intention is commendable, this House cannot give up its prerogative to review      the allocation and type of humanitarian aid to be granted case by case, otherwise      we will succumb to a logic of executive power that often goes beyond common      sense and can border on the absurd, penalizing the Brazilian people" (BRASIL,      2008a).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The initiative    was also subject to pressure from other leftist parties. Helo&iacute;sa Helena,    then Senator for the Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL), made a speech in 2004    criticizing giving humanitarian assistance to other countries instead of providing    aid to needy states in Brazil:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I appeal once      again to humanitarian aid for the Brazilian states that suffer emergencies      and floods. Of course, I have much sympathy for the people of Africa, the      Arab World and Latin America. There is no problem with that. I just want humanitarian      aid to also be provided to Brazil. A government that throws in the mud of      speculation 70% of the public budget, that chooses to fill bankers' bellies      while emptying the plates, jobs and dignity of the Brazilian people has no      moral authority to demand humanitarian aid, saying that someone in this House      was against it. No one is against it. Lies! [...]. Solidarity with others,      yes, but also solidarity with the Brazilian people!" (Senado Federal, 2004).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The humanitarian    assistance provided by Brazil during the Lula administration consisted of donations    in kind (food, medicine and general items), sending in Brazilian professionals    to help<a name="top28"></a><a href="#back28"><sup>28</sup></a>, cash donations<a name="top29"></a><a href="#back29"><sup>29</sup></a>    and participation in multilateral dialogues on humanitarian assistance.<a name="top30"></a><a href="#back30"><sup>30</sup></a>    The funds for international humanitarian assistance are authorized by the Annual    Budget Law (LOA), under the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs    (MRE).

According to a study by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) and    the ABC, Latin American and Caribbean countries received 76.27% of Brazilian    humanitarian aid between 2005 and 2009. The Asian continent received 16.44%    and Africa received 7.26% of these resources. Oceania received 0.02% of the    Brazilian aid during that period (IPEA and ABC, 2010).</font></p>     ]]></body>

Within the scope of financial cooperation, the Brazilian    government deducted a significant amount from the debt that poorer countries    had with Brazil, especially African countries. Among the beneficiaries were    Mozambique, Nigeria, Gabon, Cape Verde and Bolivia, among others. As the National    Monitoring Report of the Millennium Goals points out, "the discounts granted    to developing countries in debt with Brazil amounted to US$1.25 billion, of    which more than US$1 billion pertained to heavily indebted poor countries" (IPEA,    2010: 159).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This policy has    also generated controversy. There are many questions regarding whether or not    Brazil should have cancelled some of these countries' debts. In September 2004,    Deputy Antonio Carlos Mendes Thame, from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party,    presented Bill No. 4128, which required the Executive to obtain specific and    express permission from Congress to relieve debt. As justification, the deputy    argued:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the merits      of the announced motivation for such international acts (solidarity), we agree      with the chairman of the Federal Bar Association of Brazil, who has publicly      declared that he did not find any device in the Federal Constitution that      gives powers to the Brazilian President to unilaterally forgive debts or make      donations with public money to other countries (Thame, 2004).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The bill was in    process until 2010, when it was declared unconstitutional by means of a report    by the Committee on Constitution, Justice and Citizenship (CCJC) of the National    Congress (Congresso Nacional, 2010).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to    debt relief, Lula proposed the creation of the "Action against Hunger and Poverty"    programme in 2004, an attempt to diversify the international agenda. This action    was supported by Heads of Government such as Jacques Chirac (France), Ricardo    Lagos (Chile) and Jos&eacute; Lu&iacute;s Zapatero (Spain), as well as UN Secretary-General    Kofi Annan. The unprecedented nature of this initiative was the fact that it    proposed to create and implement innovative financing mechanisms able to finance    actions to eradicate hunger and poverty. In 2006, the proposal evolved into    a pilot project and UNITAID, a central medicine purchasing facility at the headquarters    of the World Health Organization, funded by a solidarity tax on airline tickets,    was created.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the next section    we will present the intragovernmental coordination efforts put into practice    for implementing technical cooperation and international humanitarian assistance,    highlighting the most relevant actors involved at the domestic level.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Intragovernmental    Coordination for the Implementation of South-South Technical Cooperation and    International Humanitarian Assistance</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To understand the    process of implementing foreign policy in Brazil it is necessary to contextualize    the special dynamics of this policy. The Itamaraty has historically centralized    this process. Its high level of professionalization, bureaucratic autonomy,    and insulation at times enabled the MRE to reach an almost monopolistic control    over how foreign policy is conducted (Cason and Power, 2009; Cheibub, 1985;    Faria, 2012; Pinheiro, 2009). According to Faria (2008), other factors have    also contributed to this centralization: the dominance of the Executive in Brazilian    foreign policy; the fact that Brazilian legislators delegated responsibility    for its formulation to the Executive;<a name="top31"></a><a href="#back31"><sup>31</sup></a>    the country's international isolation, which was also an outcome of adopting    the development model through import substitution; and the traditional "non-conflictive"    practice of Brazilian diplomacy (Faria, 2008: 81).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the Itamaraty's    insulation has become less pronounced since the country's redemocratization    in 1985 and after the economic liberalization that took place in the beginning    of the 1990s, which led to the appearance of new stakeholders who tend to achieve    greater influence on foreign policy decisions, in a context of the emergence    of new internal distributional conflicts (LIMA, 2000). This trend highlights    the increasing politicization of foreign policy in Brazil, reducing the monopoly    of foreign policy production by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Faria, 2012),    which also reflects the expansion and diversification of the country's international    agenda. In this sense, new governmental actors have also come into play, and    the participation of other ministries besides the MRE has become recurrent.    Silva et al. (2010) have pointed out that this process of "public fragmentation    of diplomacy" provides an increase in the bureaucratic spaces of foreign policy    formulation and a greater dialogue with society.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study of the    current institutional arrangement of Brazilian foreign policy undertaken by    the aforementioned authors demonstrated that today's competence regarding the    production of foreign policy in Brazil is shared by the entire structure of    the federal executive branch. Almost all ministries have a structure for international    affairs. Moreover, this "horizontal decentralization" can be observed both during    the decision/formulation and the implementation phases (Silva et al., 2010).    In the next subsection, the activities undertaken by the various ministries    and governmental agencies mobilized to put the solidarity-based foreign policy    into practice will be analysed in the context of technical cooperation and international    humanitarian assistance. Financial cooperation with less developed countries    involves a much smaller number of governmental agencies, demanding an implementation    structure that is not so complex, this being the reason for which it will not    be further discussed in this paper.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Intragovernmental    Coordination for the Implementation of South-South Technical Cooperation</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Puente    (2010), one of the hallmarks of Brazilian horizontal cooperation is the fact    that a multitude of actors participate in the domestic conception and implementation    of cooperation. In addition to its role in coordinating Brazilian international    cooperation, the ABC also acts in the "recruitment and mobilization" of cooperating    institutions, which, in most cases, act as executors and are fundamental to    implementing many of the actions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is estimated    that more than 120 national institutions are involved in delivering technical    cooperation.

According to Decree n&ordm; 7304 of September 22, 2010, the Agency    has the primary function of coordinating cooperation activities, but it is also    responsible for negotiating, monitoring, evaluating, planning etc. However,    it seldom acts as a direct executor of cooperation projects (BRASIL, 2010b).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/01f02.jpg">Figure    2</a> shows the institutional design of the Brazilian technical cooperation,    as well as the intragovernmental network mobilized for its implementation.

The Ministry    of Social Development and Fight against Hunger (MDS) is significantly involved    in developing technical cooperation with developing countries, as some of these    social policies fall under its responsibility.<a name="top33"></a><a href="#back33"><sup>33</sup></a>    Until 2010, the MDS had signed 62 international cooperation agreements, in the    form of memorandums, cooperation projects, letters of intent and other related    documents. Most of them are part of the South-South cooperation delivered by    the country (MDS, 2010).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the area of    professional qualification, there is the involvement of institutions such as    the National Service for Commercial Learning (SENAC) and the National Service    for Industrial Learning (SENAI). The latter has projects for restructuring education    systems and for creating professional training centres in Portuguese-speaking    countries (Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, East Timor) and Latin America    (Paraguay and Colombia) (SENAI, n.d.).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the area of    education, Brazil transfers the methodology from the National School Food Programme    (PNAE), which operates under the control of the National Fund for Educational    Development (FNDE). In 2010, thirteen countries kept cooperative agreements    with the Fund (FNDE, 2010). Furthermore, in this same area, there is the project    the NGO Solidarity in Literacy (Alfasol) has with the ABC, providing training    for teachers and technical staff in basic literacy and education for young people    and adults in Cape Verde (Alfabetiza&ccedil;&atilde;o Solid&aacute;ria, 2009).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Intragovernmental    Coordination for the Implementation of Brazilian International Humanitarian    Assistance</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main institutional    mechanism that operates international humanitarian assistance provided by Brazil    is the Interministerial Working Group on Humanitarian Assistance (GTIAHI). The    Brazilian system of international humanitarian assistance includes a set of    activities developed by a series of ministries and federal government agencies.<a name="top34"></a><a href="#back34"><sup>34</sup></a>    <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/01f03.jpg">Figure 3</a> shows the actors involved in the provision    of humanitarian assistance, as well as their mode of participation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Supply    Company (CONAB) - linked to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply    - has an important role in international humanitarian assistance. Its general    function is to manage the outflow of the national harvest, to build public stocks    and to sell them according to market movements (CONAB, 2010). The role of the    CONAB in international humanitarian aid is to act in the purchase of food, storage    and distribution logistics. Between 2004 and March 2007, it allocated nearly    220 tonnes of food for humanitarian assistance (CONAB, 2007: 5).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another important    agency in the provision of international humanitarian assistance is the National    Civil Defence Agency, which is linked to the Ministry of National Integration.    According to Decree n&ordm; 7257 of 2010, the Agency is responsible for the    articulation, coordination and technical supervision of the National System    of Civil Defence (SINDEC), and seeks to build preventative rescue, and recuperative    care; to prevent disasters; and to minimize their impacts on the population.    It is responsible for the humanitarian assistance provided by Brazil (BRASIL,    2010a) and operates internationally, donating items to countries affected by    conflict or natural disasters; sending in trained professionals; and representing    Brazil in multilateral dialogue forums dedicated to humanitarian assistance,    such as the Global Platform for Disaster Reduction in 2009.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition, we    should mention the Cabinet of Institutional Security (GSI), linked to the Presidency.    Its function, among others, is to prevent the occurrence of crises and coordinate    their management (GSI, n.d.). In international humanitarian assistance, its    role is to liaise with other agencies to provide the logistics of assistance.    In January 2010, the Office gave support to victims of the earthquakes in Chile    and Haiti (Aguilar, 2012).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The role of the    Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA) and the Ministry of Social Development    and Fight against Hunger (MDS) in international humanitarian assistance manifests    mainly through the Food Acquisition Programme (PAA).<a name="top35"></a><a href="#back35"><sup>35</sup></a>    They carry out the donation of food coming from government stocks and bought    from family farmers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This brief mapping    of programmes, projects, activities and priorities that make the "humanistic"    and "solidarity-based" foreign policy of the Lula administration concrete allows    us to understand its domestic operation. The creation of the General Coordination    of International Actions Against Hunger (CGFOME), linked to the Itamaraty, the    significant increase in both the number of projects and budget of the Brazilian    Cooperation Agency (ABC) and the greater institutionalization of international    humanitarian assistance, through the creation of the Interministerial Working    Group for International Humanitarian Assistance (GTIAHI), are some of the ways    in which the rhetoric of international solidarity has been translated into practice.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These initiatives    rely on the participation of several ministries and other public agencies, which    strengthens the thesis of "horizontal decentralization" in the production of    foreign policy. The Itamaraty has been losing exclusive control over external    issues to other parts of the state bureaucracy. Today, almost all the ministries    have their own institutional structures for handling their international interests.    In addition, the expansion and greater complexity of the Brazilian international    agenda during the Lula government reinforced the need to involve other ministries,    not only the MRE, which does not have sufficient organizational capacity, technical    expertise or the authority to implement at the national level many of the decisions    taken at the international level. Coordination problems, however, are still    legion (Ayll&oacute;n and Leite, 2010). The proper functioning of coordination    mechanisms and the creation and institutionalization of new mechanisms are crucial    for the maintenance and longevity of those policies at the top of the Brazilian    government's international agenda.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, improving    the accountability of these policies is essential, as it helps to ensure transparency    and legitimacy. The importance of accountability becomes even greater as these    actions are not free from controversy. As we have seen, assistance provided    to other countries from the South, in the form of technical or humanitarian    assistance, can and has in fact been regarded as incompatible with the social    obstacles Brazil still faces.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Concluding Remarks</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to discuss    the theory and practice of the humanistic trend in Brazilian foreign policy    under Lula (2003-2010), we have used different sorts of arguments (related to    three levels of analysis - the individual, the state and the international,    both regionally and globally) and stressed the relevance of various actors (politicians,    bureaucrats, political parties and domestic and international institutions).    In order to provide more than the panoramic view that we have given here, it    would be necessary to touch not only on International Relations Theory, but    also on Political Science, History, Public Administration, Political Psychology    and Sociology of Organizations. After all, foreign policy analysis is a multidisciplinary    field almost by definition.<a name="top36"></a><a href="#back36"><sup>36</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, what has been    the actual impact of this innovation in Brazilian foreign policy, also considering    that its scope was not restricted to the national level? One could say that    new institutions and social programmes were created and that old ones were strengthened;    that it helped to give Brazil a special place on the world stage, an outstanding    one, according to many; that it mobilized actors and institutions at home and    abroad; that it helped change the international agenda; and that it promoted    social improvement. Its sole impact on poverty and hunger alleviation is certainly    very difficult to measure. It is therefore not absurd to say that its most visible    impact, at least from the viewpoint of 2013, has been essentially political.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As Brazilians tend    to interpret the merits of the country's foreign policy in terms of economic    gains and benefits, as suggested by Lima (2005b), one could foresee that, as    a policy innovation, such a humanistic trend would not endure the sequence of    the electoral cycle. But Lula himself chose his successor, Dilma Rousseff, who    was virtually unknown to most Brazilians a few months before the 2010 presidential    election. During the contest in which PT's/Lula's candidate was victorious,    Lula repeatedly recalled the collective pride that his two terms in office supposedly    managed to promote, which can be seen as a direct product of his foreign and    social policies. The priority to the South-South axis is an entrenched tradition    of the Workers' Party. Rousseff also kept Marco Aur&eacute;lio Garcia as her    advisor for international affairs, the same member of the PT cadre who held    the post during Lula's eight years in office.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a recent seminar    promoted by Perseu Abramo Foundation, an official PT think tank, Garcia said    that Latin American integration "needs to be different", that "we need a solidarity-based    integration". "We Brazilians do not want to be Latin American Germany."<a name="top37"></a><a href="#back37"><sup>37</sup></a>    And there are several other indications of policy continuity.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dilma Rousseff's    government seems to preserve the foreign policy innovation it inherited from    the previous president, a policy orientation that does not reflect international    altruism, but an international posture of "enlightened self-interest", according    to Lima's (2005b) sympathetic suggestion. However, if such a standing results    in Brazil becoming a "post-imperial power", as Brazilian leftist media has suggested,    it is a possibility that will probably make entrenched realists smile and change    the subject. An "offensive realist" might not react so politely... Be that as    it may, Brazil has already been labelled "the soft power great power" (Dauvergne    and Farias, 2012: 913).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AG&Ecirc;NCIA BRASILEIRA    DE COOPERA&Ccedil;&Atilde;O.

<body><![CDATA[<br>   <a name="back17"></a><a href="#top17">17</a> It is important to note that Brazil's    real willingness to act as a regional paymaster is still a controversial question    among Brazilian foreign policy analysts, as evidence is contradictory.    <br>   <a name="back18"></a><a href="#top18">18</a> It must be emphasised that the    mapping that follows does not include all of the initiatives that make up this    trend. Despite some initiatives implemented, such as the research carried out    by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA) in conjunction with the    Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC) (IPEA; ABC, 2010), the Brazilian government    itself does not have a systematization of all these actions, since they are    recent, numerous, growing fast, and involve many actors. As pointed out by Puente    (2010), the cooperation activities developed by the ABC are poorly publicized,    even within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MRE).    <br>   <a name="back19"></a><a href="#top19">19</a> Source: Sistema Consular Integrado,    Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, &lt;<u><a href="http://dai-mre.serpro.gov.br/pesquisa_ato_bil" target="_blank">http://dai-mre.serpro.gov.br/pesquisa_ato_bil</a></u>&gt;.

It should be held by and between    governments and may count on the participation of public and private organizations.    Although it is an initiative among developing countries, it should not dismiss    the support of developed countries and international organizations in their    implementation" (United Nations apud Puente, 2010: 78).    <br>   <a name="back21"></a><a href="#top21">21</a> Brazilian agency responsible for    international cooperation, linked to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    <br>   <a name="back22"></a><a href="#top22">22</a> According to Puente, the recovery    process of the ABC budget began in 2002, after the inclusion of ordinary resources    for financing activities of horizontal cooperation. From 1998 to 2001, the agency's    budget came from unused resources in projects of other government agencies with    the UNDP. These funds were very low and from 1999 to 2001, served only to cover    the administrative costs and the conditionalities of received cooperation (Puente,    2010: 145-146).    <br>   <a name="back23"></a><a href="#top23">23</a> For a very interesting comparison    between Brazilian, Chinese and Indian South-South development cooperation showing    the distinctiveness of the Brazilian cooperation, see Souza, 2012.    <br>   <a name="back24"></a><a href="#top24">24</a> The Zero Hunger Programme is a    strategy driven by the federal government to ensure the right to adequate food    to people with little access to it.

There are two requirements for a "provisory    measure" to be issued: the urgency and the relevance of the matter to be regulated.    <br>   <a name="back28"></a><a href="#top28">28</a> For example, doctors, psychologists,    coroners, military personnel and civil defence professionals, among others.    <br>   <a name="back29"></a><a href="#top29">29</a> These funds are used to pay for    flights transporting items of humanitarian assistance, for the purchase of items    in recipient countries and for voluntary contributions to UN offices and organizations    involved in humanitarian assistance.    <br>   <a name="back30"></a><a href="#top30">30</a> Specifically, in the Global Platform    for Disaster Risk Reduction, within the UN International Strategy for Disaster    Reduction, as a donor of the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery    (GFDRR), as organizer of the Second Regional Meeting on International Humanitarian    Assistance Mechanisms and in the MERCOSUR Specialized Meeting on Social and    Natural Disaster Risk Reduction, Civil Defence, Civil Protection, and Humanitarian    Assistance (REHU) in 2008.    <br>   <a name="back31"></a><a href="#top31">31</a> This argument of a supposed legislative    delegation was originally developed by Lima and Santos (2001). More recently,    the literature has emphasised the contribution made by the Brazilian legislative    to the production of the country's foreign policy (e.g: Alexandre, 2006; Diniz    and Ribeiro, 2008; and Almeida, 2013).    <br>   <a name="back32"></a><a href="#top32">32</a> Oswaldo Cruz Foundation is a Brazilian    scientific institution for research and development in biomedicine.    <br>   <a name="back33"></a><a href="#top33">33</a> E.g. the Zero Hunger Programme    (promoting food security and nutrition), the "Bolsa Fam&iacute;lia" (a programme    of income transfer, which benefits families in extreme poverty), the construction    of cisterns (a receptacle for water, built to catch and store rainwater) etc.    <br>   <a name="back34"></a><a href="#top34">34</a> The GTIAHI is coordinated by the    CGFOME, linked to the MRE, and composed of the following agencies: Civil House;    Ministry of Defence; Ministry of Justice, represented by the National Department    of Public Security; Ministry of Finance, represented by the Internal Revenue    Service; Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply, represented by the National    Supply Company (CONAB); Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social Development and    Fight against Hunger; Ministry of National Integration, represented by the National    Civil Defence Agency; General Secretariat of the Presidency of Republic; Institutional    Security Cabinet of the Presidency; Ministry of Education; Ministry of Agrarian    Development; Ministry of Communications; and Special Secretariat for Human Rights.    <br>   <a name="back35"></a><a href="#top35">35</a> "Created in 2003, the Food Acquisition    Programme (PAA) is one of the actions of the Zero Hunger Programme and aims    to ensure access to food in the necessary quantity and regularity for populations    in situations of food and nutrition insecurity. It also aims to contribute to    forming strategic stocks, allows family farmers to store their produce to be    sold at fair prices and promotes social inclusion in rural areas. It is run    by the Ministries of Agrarian Development (MDA) and Social Development and Fight    against Hunger (MDS) with state and local governments and civil society organizations"(MDA,    n.d.).    <br>   <a name="back36"></a><a href="#top36">36</a> According to Valerie Hudson, "Explanatory    variables from all levels of analysis, from the most micro to the most macro,    are of interest to the analyst to the extent that they affect the decision making    process. As a result, insights from many intellectual disciplines, such as Psychology,    Sociology, Organizational Behaviour, Anthropology, Economics and so forth, will    be useful for the foreign policy analyst in efforts to explain foreign policy    decision making, making multi-/interdisciplinarity a third hallmark of FPA [Foreign    Policy Analysis]". (2007, p.6).    ]]></body>

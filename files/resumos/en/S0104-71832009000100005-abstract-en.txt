In this paper I focus on Brazilian women' migration to Europe in the context of the transacionalization and imbrications of sex and marriage markets. The analysis is based on anthropological research studies carried out in Italy and Spain with the aim of apprehending the political, economic and cultural aspects associated with this type of migration. Taking as reference the social networks activated during the migratory process and these women's participation in the sending and receiving countries, I consider the notion of transnationalism present in the debates about prostitution and migration studies. I argue that in order to understand transnational practices in this type of migration it is necessary to focus on a broad approach that takes into account women's spaces for agency.

This article is intended to assess the relationships between "body and technology" in the context of the modern social project, taking the notions of "productive body" and "draft body" as reference. The analysis is developed through bibliographic sources of the field of sociology and the body, articulating this debate with authors of the physical education field. The concept of draft body proved to be heuristic for understanding the relationships of the body with technological processes in our time. It was preliminarily concluded that the conception of body underwent changes and distinct representations throughout history; however, currently, such modifications happen routinely producing a fluid notion, according to which one could be, at any time, what one wished to be.

Teacher training is currently the center of events in the world of education, yielding approval and controversy, and pointing out the need for reforms in the area. Reasons for these reforms, for some, are linked to the negative results in student performance, which have not met the labor market's demands. This text analyzes teacher training reform as an international trend, linked to multilateral agencies' requirements, whose purpose is to serve the process of globalization. Based on this logic, the aim is to identify the premises of such reform, the conceptual framework and the methodological contributions which have supported the process. The text presents some axes which have sustained teacher training reforms, such as: "universitarization"/professionalization, emphasis on practical training/certification of experience, continuous training and competence-based pedagogy, analyzing the importance of each in the international context.

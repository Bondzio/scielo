<p>The livestock species play very important economic and socio-cultural roles for the
               wellbeing of rural households, such as food supply, source of income, asset saving,
               source of employment, soil fertility, livelihoods, transport, agricultural traction,
               agricultural diversification and sustainable agricultural production. The aim of this
               work was to identify and characterize the different roles that livestock and
               livestock species play in rural communities of Timor-Leste, highlighting the
               importance of animal production for the wellbeing and rural development, and relate
               the functions performed by livestock production with economic, social and cultural
               attributes of the communities. The data used in this study were collected in 2011
               through a questionnaire survey in three rural communities in the district of
               Bobonaro, namely in a mountain area, an irrigation plain and a coastal zone, and were
               complemented with secondary data. Livestock production in Timor-Leste is
               predominantly familiar being chickens, pigs, goats, cattle, horses, buffaloes and
               sheep the main species. Beyond the economic function, each livestock species also
               performs social and cultural functions.</p>

<p>The livestock species play very important economic, social and cultural roles or
            functions for rural households once they contribute to improve income and wellbeing of
            the farm family. Livestock helps on food supply, family nutrition, family income, asset
            savings, soil productivity, livelihoods, transport, agricultural traction, agricultural
            diversification and sustainable agricultural production, family and community
            employment, ritual purposes and social status (<sup><a href="#B20">MOYO et
               al., 2010</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Livestock functions can be classified in several ways. According to FAO (<sup><a href="#B16">ILRI, 1995</a></sup>), two widely used classifications are
            based on the kinds of output produced or in the uses in which these outputs are put on.
            Among the kinds of output produced it should be mentioned the food, inputs to cropping,
            and raw materials. Among output uses, subsistence consumption by the livestock holder's
            household, direct supply of inputs, cash income through sales of live animals or their
            output, savings and investment and social functions such as paying bride wealth, or
            providing animals for communal feasts or sacrifices can be pointed out.</p>
<p>Another classification divides livestock functions in economic roles such as source of
            cash income and mean of savings accumulation, direct feed use for family subsistence,
            input supply such as fertilizer and animal draught and capacity to comply with a set of
            social rules and obligations.</p>
<p>Livestock has an important contribution for food supply of rural and urban areas and
            contributes to the family nutrition, supplying animal protein. As household income
            increases, the consumption of protein increases, principally from animal origin,
            allowing the substitution of vegetal by animal protein. Besides milk, eggs and meat used
            as a source of food, other livestock products are used for domestic consumption and
            local sale such as skins, hides and horns.</p>
<p>Livestock feature as living savings can be converted into cash whenever the family needs
            it, is a security asset influencing access to informal credits and loans and being also
            a source of collateral for loans. In many rural regions, in special where financial
            markets are absent or non-existent, livestock stocks or herds are a source of asset
            accumulation and a measure of prosperity. Livestock stocks or assets can be mobilized at
            any time, satisfying planned expenditures such as children school fees and bride wealth
            or unplanned expenses such as the illness and death of family members. This livestock
            asset could be seen as "bank account" and it is also an important source of family
            savings that can be used in years of low crop production, reducing income insecurity and
            household vulnerability, being an important source of risk reduction and security
            increase.</p>
<p>Livestock production is closely interrelated with crop production. The use of livestock
            and its sub product manure are important in crop production. Livestock is a source of
            energy providing draught animal power while manure improves soil structure and fertility
            as well as water retention. Both uses are environmentally friendly improving energy and
            nutrient cycling. Livestock is also used to transport agricultural inputs and outputs
            and people.</p>
<p>Livestock production is an important mean of exchange between rural households and, when
            sold, contributes to boost and strengthen rural markets. Rural markets are an important
            piece in the operation mode of rural communities and a significant contribution for
            rural families' wellbeing and wealth.</p>
<p>The livestock social functions correspond to the symbolic values associated to each
            species and the use of animals for the fulfillment of a set of rituals and social
            obligations of families and communities. Livestock gives social status to its owners
            once it is considered a common mean of demonstrating wealth and provides economic status
            as it facilitates the access to informal credits and loans to the households. Livestock
            is also used in traditional rituals, ceremonies and festivities and is given as a gift
            in worships (e.g. installation of ancestral spirits, ritual slaughter, bride
            wealth).</p>
<p>In some cultures, animals can be considered sacred (cattle in India) and in others
            cultures (pigs in Muslim countries) animals are impure. For both these cultures, those
            species are not consumed by the population. In other countries or cultures, animals play
            an important leisure role, being used for betting, like horse racing and cock fighting,
            for sports, like horses in polo and bullfighting and for hunting, like dogs, falcons and
            horses.</p>
<p>Animal health greatly affects livestock functions, not only by direct effects on animal
            productivity but also by indirect effects, namely concerning human health, coasts
            associated to disease control, international movement restrictions of animals and animal
            products as well as animal welfare (<sup><a href="#B24">OTTE and CHILONDA,
               2000</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Concerning the direct effect on productivity, it can be due not only to the mortality
            and reduction of livestock herds, but also, due to the decrease on productive
            parameters, namely weight gain or milk production, or even through the decrease of
            quality of animal products. The existence of a great number of parasitary, infectious or
            metabolic diseases that affect fertility cannot be underestimated, despite the
            difficulty to quantify the associated costs.</p>
<p>Besides the positive effects of livestock to human welfare, livestock production and
            consumption can also be associated to some risks, namely the transmission of important
            diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans (zoonosis). The absence of rigorous
            animal health control programs represents a high risk to the human health. Moreover the
            rigorous control and restrictions to animal movement and to exportation of animal
            products, associated with the existence of animal disease, makes the existence of
            national animal health programs indispensable in order to allow international trade.</p>
<p>The social and cultural functions of livestock are often ignored when estimating the
            total contribution of livestock to the development and well-being of rural communities.
            Since those functions are difficult to value in monetary terms, emphasis is mainly
            placed on the physical marketed livestock production. One key to smallholder
            competitiveness is its ability to capture non market benefits, however not well measured
            to date (<sup><a href="#B25">OUMA et al., 2003</a></sup>).</p>
<p>It is relevant to know the present functions of the livestock sector, and to understand
            that expanding the output of one function may diminish the output of another. So, in
            order to evaluate its importance, from different points of views, and to ensure correct
            policies and practices, all of them have to be taken in consideration.</p>
<p>Livestock production in Timor-Leste is predominantly familiar, the main species
            including chickens, pigs, goats, horses, cattle, buffaloes and sheep, and each one
            performing several functions for rural communities and families.</p>
<p>The aim of this work is, for three rural communities in the district of Bobonaro
            -mountain area, irrigation plain and coastal zone -, to identify and characterize the
            different roles that livestock and livestock species play in rural communities,
            highlighting the importance of animal production for the wellbeing and rural
            development, and relate the functions performed by livestock production with economic,
            social and cultural attributes of the communities.</p>
<p>The primary data used in this study was collected in 2011 through a questionnaire survey
            and complemented with secondary data from different consulted sources. The farmers
            survey was conducted in three sucos, Tapo-Tas, Tapo-Memo and Aidabaleten, of the
            district of Bobonaro, where 101 households were selected by convenience sampling. The 13
            districts of East Timor are subdived in 67 subdistricts and those are subdivided into
            442 villages-sucos - and 2,336 communities or hamlets - aldeias. The questionnaire
            characterized the economic and the sociocultural functions that livestock production
            plays in the life, wellbeing and development of rural households and communities. The
            secondary data used included the studies made during Portuguese colonial period and
            after the 1999 referendum and the data collected in the different livestock census, in
            special the 2004 and 2010 census. The analysis performed was essentially descriptive and
            qualitative, highlighting the functions that livestock still performs in the rural
            communities of Timor-Leste.</p>
<p>After this introduction, in the second part livestock production in Timor-Leste is
            characterized, in the third section the functions of livestock production and species in
            Timor-Leste are explained and in the final part the main conclusions are drawn.</p>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp5563568"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Livestock production in Timor-Leste</p>
<p>Regarding livestock production in Timor-Leste, it is important to remember that sheep
               and cows were introduced sometime in the past, after the arrival of the Portuguese
               and Europeans in the territory and that at the beginning of the XXth century the
               number of cattle was very small, in 1920 was 617, and only in 1954 reached more than
               10,000 heads.</p>
<p>The evolution of the number of livestock heads during the last century shows three
               moments in which the livestock stocks were severely reduced: second world war,
               beginning of the war for independence or beginning of Indonesian occupation and
               referendum for independence, as can be seen in <a href="#f1">Figure
                  1</a>, where the number of livestock heads is expressed in terms of livestock
               standard units (LSU). The LSU at the end of Portuguese colonization is very similar
               to the one observed nowadays. However, LSU per capita is lower nowadays due to the
               population growth that was observed during the last 40 years. At the end of
               Portuguese colonization, LSU per capita were around 0.65 while nowadays is around
               0.43.</p>

<p>A comparative static analysis can be made between the different historical periods

               buffalos decreased 25%, horses decreased 50%, pigs increased 1.5 times and goat
               decreased 30%.</p>

<p>The majority of rural households and a significant number of urban households own
               some sort of livestock, 76.63% of the total number of households rear livestock.
               Livestock species, per order of importance in head numbers, are chicken, pigs, goats,
               cattle, horses, buffalos and sheep (<sup><a href="#B9">DNE 2006</a></sup>;
                  <sup><a href="#B10">DNE 2011</a></sup>). Between 2004 and 2010, the
               number of heads increased for all species reported, excepted for horses.</p>
<p>From the household point of view, the most important livestock species are chickens
               and pigs. In 2004, more than 70% of the households owned these two species, while, in
               2010, that percentage decreased to around 67%. The percentage of households with
               cattle and goats is around 20%, and between 2004 and 2010 there was an increase in
               the number of household holders of 8.3 and 9.3%, respectively. In the same period,
               the households with horses decreased 19.3%, from 17.6% to 15.0%, while households
               with buffalos decreased 13.6%, from 11.3 to 10.4%. The percentage of household with
               sheep is small, around 4%, with a reduction in the period of 11.9%. In overall terms,
               between 2004 and 2010, only in cattle and goat production, there was an increase in
               the number of households involved in those livestock activities.</p>
<p>The average number of heads of livestock per household is low, but some large
               producers are found throughout the country. In 2010, the average number of heads is 6
               for sheep, 5.6 for chicken, 5.0 for buffalos, 3.8 for cattle, 3.3 for goats, 2.7 for
               pigs and 2.1 for horses. Between 2004 and 2010, the average number of livestock heads
               per household increased. The reduction in the number of households involved in
               livestock production and the increase in livestock density per family is a phenomenon
               that often happens simultaneously (<a href="#t2">Table
               2</a>).</p>

<p>As expected, the percentage of urban households with livestock is much lower than
               those of rural households. Around 79.9% of rural households have some sort of
               livestock production and only 56.1% of urban households do.</p>
<p>The more relevant livestock species for urban households are chickens and pigs, 41.3
               and 41.0%, respectively. Regarding the average number of livestock heads per
               household, urban areas show higher stock rates for all the species, except for pigs
                  (<a href="#t3">Table 3</a>).</p>

            </p>
<p>The comparison between 2004 and 2010 of urban and rural households that rear
               livestock shows that the number and proportion of urban households with chicken and
               pigs decreased, while the number and proportion of urban households with sheep
               increased. Regarding livestock heads, the urban number and proportion of heads
               increased for chicken and sheep and decreased for pigs.</p>
<p>Concerning the percentage of households involved in the production of each animal
               species, per district, one can conclude that the importance of pigs and chicken is
               similar in almost all the districts (around 70%), with exception for the urban
               district of Díli (around 30%) and Liquiça (84% and 82%, respectively for chicken and
               pigs). Covalima, Bobonaro and Oecussi are the more representative districts
               concerning cattle production, with almost half of households owning cattle (Covalima
               49.3%, Bobonaro 43.3% and Oecussi 44.5%). Household engagement in buffalo production
               is higher in Viqueque (24.2%), Lautem (22.3%), Manatuto (19.2%), Manufahi (19.2%) and
               Ainaro (15.3%).The most important districts involved in goat production are Liquiça
               (50.1%) Aileu (39.7%), Oecussi (35.6%), Manatuto (32.8%) and Baucau (30.2%) and sheep
               production is mainly restricted to Baucau and Manatuto districts, respectively with
               17.8% and 6.1% of the households involved. Horse distribution is higher in the
               mountainous districts, Ainaro (37.5%), Manufahi (29.7%), Manatuto (25.5%), Baucau
               (24.7%) and Aileu (24.0%).</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of livestock species per district, in overall terms, the
               districts of Baucau, Viqueque and Bobonaro are the ones that show higher proportion
               of livestock heads. For chicken, the order is Baucau, Viqueque and Bobonaro, for pigs
               Bobonaro, Baucau and Viqueque, for goats Baucau, Bobonaro and Liquiça, for cattle
               Bobonaro, Viqueque and Covalima, for horses Baucau, Viqueque and Ainaro, for buffalos
               Viqueque, Baucau and Lautem and for sheep Baucau with more 55% of total heads (<a href="#t4">Table 4</a>).</p>

            </p>
<p>Livestock feeding is done using native pastures, crop and fallow land, agricultural
               products and waste materials around houses and villages. No grazing management rules
               of natural pastures leads many times to overgrazing and unsustainable animal
               production due to loss of the cover vegetation and enhanced soil erosion. Native
               pastures available occupy an area of around 200,000 ha, about 10% of the country area
                  (<sup><a href="#B7">CRUZ, 2003</a></sup>). The average number of cows and
               buffalos per ha of native pasture is around 1.,3 heads, higher than 3 for the
               districts of Dili, Aileu and Ermera and less than 1 for Lautem, Covalima and
               Manufahi,.</p>
<p>In overall terms, animal production is performed without any special concerns
               regarding feeding, reproduction or even health management. Animals are kept all
               together around the year, eating what is available, reproducing around all the
               seasons and fighting most of the diseases based only in their natural resistance.
               Vaccination is performed only for a few diseases, namely haemorrhagic septicaemia in
               cattle and buffalos; classic swine fever in pigs and Newcastle disease in chicken.
               However, as there is no consistent official animal identification, is difficult to
               evaluate the overall efficacy of its application.</p>
<p>Pigs and goats are mostly free ranging, some being housed near human houses and
               sometimes feeding with domestic feed debris. Chicken are almost raised as scavenging
               birds. Some times are housed at night and feed with domestic feed debris.</p>
<p>Buffalos, cattle and sheep are raised free in native pastures. Changes in feed
               quality are seasonal and associated with changes in rainfall, which results sometimes
               in inadequate feed supply. Problems of inadequate feeding are more frequently
               associated with inadequate quality, namely low protein content, than with complete
               absence of aliment and sometimes are due to poor feed resources utilization (<sup><a href="#B32">SMITH, 1992</a></sup>). The low quality of native grasses
               namely in the dry season, in which protein contents can fall below 4%, and the
               inability of the traditional grazing management methods to improve pasture
               utilization and enrichment are good examples of cattle and buffalo production
               constrains (<sup><a href="#B35">TIMOR AGRI, 2004</a></sup>).</p>
<p>In many situations, livestock underfeeding is observed but no feed supplements are
               supplied. Actually, in some areas, cattle and buffalos are supplemented with
               leguminous trees, namely <em>Gliricidia sepium</em> and <em>Leucaena
                  leucocephala</em>. However, and as referred in the past, at the present time
               frequently the nutrition of livestock species and working horses is often neglected
               and many still suffer from hunger (<sup><a href="#B7">CRUZ,
               2003</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Despite the lack of reliable information on reproductive data, there is consensus
               that livestock fertility rate is low. The absence of a defined reproductive season
               and the associated nutritional constrains described above, as well as the possible
               existence of diseases affecting fertility can be responsible for this situation. The
               low fertility will affect animal selection and genetic progress. Moreover, the use of
               male animals in some rituals may have important consequences on fertility, mainly if
               the younger and better animals are the selected ones, staying in the farms only the
               older males to be used in reproduction. Recently, a survey was conducted by MAF
               (Minister of Agriculture and Fishery), with the support of the Faculty of Veterinary
               Medicine of Bogor University. The results show high serological prevalence of
               Brucellosis in cattle and buffalos in some districts of East Timor, which can be in
               part responsible for this low fertility (<sup><a href="#B5">CONCEIÇÃO,
                  2012</a></sup>). More research is needed in order to understand the real impact on
               fertility of this disease.</p>
<p>Local livestock species, such as chicken and pigs, are more valuable than the
               imported ones. Regarding the gender divisions, usually women take care of small
               animals that live around the house, chicken and pigs, and men of the others, goats,
               buffalos, horses and cattle (our observations and <sup><a href="#B19">MIRANDA, 2011</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Regardless the importance of livestock species in Timor-Leste, few studies have been
               performed in animal health distribution and no diseases are reported in OIE database
                  (<sup><a href="#B23">OIE, 2012</a></sup>).</p>
<p>In the past, surra (<em>Trypanosoma evansi</em>) and hemorrhagic septicemia
                  (<em>Pasteurella multocida</em>) have been described as causing high
               mortality in Timor-Leste, namely in buffalos (<sup><a href="#B38">VALDEZ,
                  1927</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B38">VALDEZ 1929</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B30">SILVA, 1954</a></sup>). Moreover, <sup><a href="#B30">Silva (1960</a></sup>) performed a parasitic prospection in Timor-Leste in
               which he describes the internal and external parasitic fauna existent in the island,
               including <em>Trypanosoma evansi, Fasciola hepatica Ascaris lumbricoide,Taenia
                  solium </em>and <em>Coccidea sp.</em> as well as a variety of ticks,
               namely, <em>Amblyoma cyprium cyprium, Boophilus microplus, Haemaphysalis papuana,
                  Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides, Rhipicephalus sanguineus</em>, which are well
               known vectors of important animal diseases. A recent parasitic prospection (<sup><a href="#B5">CONCEIÇÃO, 2012</a></sup>), conducted by MAF with the
               cooperation of Bogor University, showed the presence of parasites in cattle, buffalos
               and pigs. The parasites identified with higher prevalence in cattle and buffalos were
                  <em>Anaplasma sp.</em> (26.4%), <em>Babesia sp</em>. (23.4%),
                  <em>Theileria sp</em>. (19%), and <em>Coccidia sp.,</em> in 11.9%
               of the samples. In pigs the more frequent parasites included <em>Coccidia
                  sp</em>. (24.6%), <em>Eperythrozonn sp. </em>(24.5%) and
                  <em>Ascaris sp</em>. (17.6%).</p>
<p>Nowadays, Timor-Leste official veterinary services developed and applied veterinary
               programs concerning the control of some animal diseases, namely, as referred,
               hemorrhagic septicemia in cattle and buffalo, classic swine fever in pigs and
               Newcastle disease in chicken. The serological survey conducted by MAF, referred
               earlier in this text, also included the serological evaluation concerning the agents
               of these diseases. Positive serology was found in buffalos and cattle for Brucellosis
               and for <em>Pasteurella multocida</em> (hemorrhagic septicemia), in pigs for
               the virus of classic swine fever and in chicken for the virus of Newcastle disease
               and Infectious Bursal disease (<sup><a href="#B5">CONCEIÇÃO,
               2012</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Concerning the zoonotic diseases, the risk is highly improved due to the absence of
               animal official identification and routine animal health controls, indispensables for
               the control of important zoonosis, namely brucellosis and tuberculosis. The recent
               confirmation of the presence of Brucellosis in cattle and buffalos (FELICIANO, 2012)
               emphasize the urgent need of developing an official program for the control of this
               important disease. Moreover some livestock animals, namely pigs, are important
               reservoirs of emergent diseases in humans, namely Japanese encephalitis, which have
               been recently identified in Timor-Leste (<sup><a href="#B39">WHO,
                  2012</a></sup>). Because pigs are mostly free ranging, some being housed near human
               houses, the risk for encephalitis is higher in the rural areas where rice fields and
               pigs coexist.</p>

               Timor-Leste</p>
<p>The descriptions made by the Portuguese during the XX century about Timor-Leste
               livestock species talk about buffalos, cattle, horses and pigs as a symbol of wealth,
               being the greatness of a king, chief or a simple man of the people, assessed by the
               number of animals or herds owned.</p>
<p>Although there were significant livestock numbers and the fact that animals are an
               important source of proteins, the population rarely consumed their animals at home,
               except during funerals or feasts. Animals were a way of capital accumulation and
               savings, which could be employed at the time of household necessities.</p>
<p>The Timor-Leste population does not explore livestock in economic and profitability
               terms. The animals are mostly used to sell or exchange for other products and to
               perform ceremonies and rituals. Livestock is seen as immobilized resource or wealth
               with low economic profitability (<sup><a href="#B38">VALDEZ, 1929</a></sup>;

<p>Livestock species are a source of protein for Timor-Leste population but the
               consumption of meat is not done in a daily basis, instead it happens in the absence
               of vegetables, in the presence of guests and at the time when ceremonies are made,
               being chicken and pork the preferred ones. Meat dog is also consumed either at home
               or in the traditional restaurants, though in Viqueque only by men, being assumed that
               for women it is considered sacred (<sup><a href="#B19">MIRANDA,
                  2011</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Despite the old descriptions that referred that pure milk and milk mixed with rice or
               crushed corn were consumed as a delicious <em>manjar</em> and that the milk
               left was sold (<sup><a href="#B17">Martinho, 1936</a></sup>), at present,
               milk from local production is not drunk, while eggs consumption is restricted, mostly
               due to the fact that in the free ranging system it is often difficult to find and
               collect the eggs.</p>
<p>The results obtained in three sucos of Bobonaro district show that the majority of
               the population eat meat only once a week (53.9%) and 31.4% twice a week (<a href="#t6">Table 6</a>). Tapo-Memo population has higher
               consumption of meat than the other two sucos perhaps because this is a more urban
               suco. These overall results are better than the ones obtained by <sup><a href="#B8">Deus (2011</a></sup>) for Letefoho sub-district, in Ermera
               district, in which the majority of the population eat meat once a month (47.7%) and
               29.1% twice a week. These modest results confirm some of the descriptions made during
               Portuguese colonial period that reported to be rare the Timor-Leste population eat

<p>The technologies used by subsistence agriculture are traditional ones with low modern

<p>During the Portuguese colonization and Indonesian occupation, several attempts were

               but also for the other agricultural activities such as maize. For example, with the
               supervision of Portuguese administration, fields experiments were made to use ploughs
               adapted to the thin and unfertile mountainous soils (<sup><a href="#B28">SILVA, 1910</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B17">MARTINHO, 1936</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B33">THOMAZ, 1974</a></sup>). During the Indonesian occupation,
               attempts were made, principally through transmigrants, to increase the use of draft
               animals, while after 1999 several programs and projects provided training and support

               ploughs are not used in Timor-Leste by the rural population since the country is
               outside the diffusion area of the Chinese plough, that reached Philippines and North

<p>The Timorese horse is one of the greatest richness of Timor-Leste people. From Arab

            Having hard shell and not using horseshoe, climbs like a goat the highest mountains and
            the steepest barriers and goes down without hesitation the most rugged slopes, walks the

            and race, although can be used for draught (VALDEZ, 1926; <sup><a href="#B29">SILVA, 1954</a></sup>).</p>
<p>In the past, horses were used not only as transportation and draught animal power, but
            also in the wars between the different kingdoms and between them and the Portuguese
            colonial power. Horses were also used in the hunt of deer. Until the XIX century,
            Timor-Leste horses were well known in the South East Asia for their excellent qualities
            and were exported for Philippines and Dutch territories (MARTINHO, 1936).</p>

<a name="idp5732864"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Socio-cultural functions</p>
<p>There has been an increased interest in the role and impact of livestock in the
               livelihoods of the poor in the last decade and livestock are starting to be viewed as
               a capital, like other forms of capital (natural, financial and so on). According to
               the FAO (<sup><a href="#B16">ILRI, 1995</a></sup>), paying bride wealth with
               animals or providing animals for communal feasts or sacrifices could be considered as
               social functions of the livestock activity.</p>
<p>The social functions corresponds to the symbolic values associated to each species
               and the use of animals for the fulfillment of a set of rituals and social obligations
               (funerals, ritual slaughter, bride wealth) of families and communities, either formal
               and informal, and in this way animals are a mean to strengthen social networks.
               Livestock also play a social role by giving social and economic status to livestock
               owners, facilitating the access of the households to, both informal and formals,
               financial services, i.e. animals can be used as collateral. They are also considered
               a common mean of demonstrating wealth.</p>
<p>To fully understand the social role of livestock, it is also important to consider
               the role that gender plays in livestock production. To treat the pigs and chickens is
               considered a women's work, on the opposite the guard of buffaloes and cows, which are
               male property, is considered a man's job. The same division applies to its
               commercialization, women are in charge of small animals and men of big ones (our
               observations and <sup><a href="#B19">MIRANDA, 2011</a></sup>). In rituals
               there are animals that have a feminine symbolic value and others with masculine
               symbolic value, for instance pigs are considered feminine social goods while buffalos
               and cows are masculine social goods.</p>
<p>Animals have also for Timor-Leste people leisure value once they are used for racing,
               hunting and fighting games.</p>
<p>During Portuguese colonial period horse racing became very pleasing to the Timorese
               people. The descriptions made say that bets were made, in which participated local
               and European people, involving sometimes appreciable amounts, horses and riders
               entered the racetrack under standing ovations and assistants accompanied the running
               of the race with great enthusiasm, especially the punters or bettors (<sup><a href="#B11">FIGUEIREDO, 2004</a></sup>). Nowadays, horse racing is
               regaining its importance with the construction of the hippodrome in Batugadé in the
               border to West Timor. The last horse races were integrated in the commemorations of
               the 10th anniversary of the independence of the country and counted with Australia,
               Indonesia and Timor-Leste participation. The horse racing is seen as important to
               tourism and economic development (<sup><a href="#B21">NARCISO,
                  2012</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The deer hunting in Timor-Leste was done in the past and in some zones is still done
               nowadays. In the past, horses were used in this activity in which animals were hunted
               with a javelin. The old descriptions tell us about the ability of hunters in handling
               simultaneously the horse and the javelin when tracking down and killing the deer.</p>
<p>Cock fighting is one of the older traditions of Timor-Leste and one of the games
               preferred by Timor-Leste people from all regions. It is a popular masculine pastime
               where women are not allowed to participate (<sup><a href="#B15">HICKS,
                  2001</a></sup>). Cocks are admired in Timor because of their courage and perseverance
               and the courage of a man is sometimes compared with that of a cock, while a coward is
               called a hen. The cock fighter is inseparable from his owner and it is common to see
               men carrying cocks under their arms as precious possessions.</p>
<p>Cockfights are held on any social occasion when men get together, from the
               spontaneous to more formal occasions and are part of many weekly markets. In the
               past, the animals represented always two factions or two villages and not only fight
               for their owners, but also for the two villages or kingdoms. There were two fights,
               between the two cocks and between the bets made by people belonging to the two
               factions.</p>
<p>It is a gambling game and a very important leisure activity in Timor-Leste. It is a
               fight to first blood, it makes it very quick, 10-20 seconds from the wind-up to first
               blood, and there is always someone on site, to stitch up the loser and he can go home
               to the cooking pot or to stud. East Timorese people says gambling is in their blood
               after centuries of cock-fighting and many times lose all their belongings in an
               afternoon of betting in cock fighting (<sup><a href="#B2">BRAGA,
                  1935</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B12">FONTOURA, 1940</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B27">SÁ, 1963</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The Portuguese colonial government tried, but was not able to end this practice, and
               instead implemented a tax to its realization, thus becoming a source of income to the
               state. Beside the fact that many <em>tais </em>designs include the cock, its
               representation in the coins (10 <em>cêntimos</em>) is a tribute to the
               culture and to the courage of Timorese's people to fight over time to achieve their
               independence. The portuguese poet Ruy Cinatti, also in a tribute to Timor-Leste
               culture make the following poem about cock fighting.</p>
<p>
               <blockquote><p>A Luta de Galos (desporto número um dos Timorenses)</p></blockquote>

            </p>
<p>

<p>
               <blockquote><p>in "Um Cancioneiro Para Timor" - Ruy Cinatti, 1996</p></blockquote>
            </p>
<p>The description made before the second world war say that the Timor-Leste people,
               with his patience and perseverance, manufactures small articles from the black and
               white horns of the buffalos, such as dolls, utensils of ménage and adornments, which
               are a demonstration of his skills and artistic sense (<sup><a href="#B12">FONTOURA, 1940</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B2">BRAGA, 1935</a></sup>).
               Nowadays there are some handcraft made with animal raw materials such as skins and
               horns, used to build drums and other artifacts.</p>
<p>Cattle and special buffalos are owned as an index of wealth, outward sign of wealth,
               often created by mere ostentation, without the intention to extract from it any net
               income.</p>
<p>Cattle ownership largely determines social status in village communities. Owners of
               large numbers of cattle are important people in society and are always involved in
               important village events. The Timorese evaluates the wealth of a chief, boss, or a
               simple man by jewelry, clothes and animals he has, and the buffalo always enter in
               this calculation with a significant weight (<sup><a href="#B7">CRUZ,
                  2003</a></sup>).</p>
<p>For all the reasons, farmers are reluctant to slaughter animals, namely cattle and
               buffalos, for their own consumption, except during funerals, festivals or wedding
               celebrations. Occasionally, a farmer will slaughter an animal but will negotiate with
               relatives, friends and neighbors beforehand to ensure that the excess can be
               sold.</p>
<p>Cattle are more valuable than goats, sheep and pigs from a social point of view but
               they are not as easy to sell. Goats, sheep and pigs can be sold easily whenever
               farmers face economic difficulties. Ruminants are important for meeting the needs of
               major local markets throughout the territory (<sup><a href="#B7">CRUZ,
                  2003</a></sup>).</p>
<p>According to <sup><a href="#B3">Cinatti (1987</a></sup>), in Timorese
               society, the buffalo is one of the most useful/helpful animals. The buffalo is a
               "multi-task" animal: it works, give prestige and it is used in ceremonies. As a
               working animal, it is indispensable to prepare the lowland rice fields; it gives
               prestige as buffalos are used as a measure of wealth and as simple method of save
               accumulation.</p>
<p>During the last century, several authors mention the Buffalo as the sacrificial
               animal per excellence in agricultural, weddings and burial rituals (<sup><a href="#B37">VALDEZ, 1927</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B17">MARTINHO, 1936</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B33">THOMAZ, 1974</a></sup>; SÁ,
               1963). <sup><a href="#B17">Martinho (1936</a></sup>) refers that "estilos"
               of "Ocoí-Mate" cause the dead of some thousands of animals, buffaloes, pigs and goats
               around the year. Even nowadays buffalos are part of the "barlaque" and are
               indispensable in "estilos" of Ocoí-Mate. The <em>estilo</em> of "Ocoí-Mate"
               is a memorial service for departed souls. Animistic and superstitions says that the
               soul of the deceased does not feel quiet if relatives, in funeral ceremonies, not
               sacrifice a few buffalos.</p>
<p>The buffalo meat is of inferior quality but in Timor people makes extensive use of
               it. Their meat is appreciated in most of the territory. In fact, in terms of meat
               quality, the buffalo is lower than those of cattle, but in the traditional system,
               presents an opposite meaning, i.e., taking as an example, the dowry and the funerals,
               the buffalo has more symbolic importance than that cattle. Another dimension
               considered important to treat this animal is the size and length of horns. The
               largest value resides in the length of the horns and not on the size and volume of
               the body.</p>
<p>One of the social functions is the use of animals for the fulfillment of a set of
               rituals and social obligations (funerals, ritual slaughter, bride wealth) of families
               and communities, either formal and informal.</p>
<p>For the three sucos studied, the animals that are more relevant for traditional
               ceremonies and festivities "estilos" are pigs and cattle followed by chicken and
               goats. Cattle are more important for Tapo-Tas and Aidabaleten, while pigs and chicken
               are for Tapo-Memo (<a href="#t11">Table 11</a>). Regarding the
               households that are involved in livestock rearing, 51.5% use cattle, 47.0% pigs,
               46.7% goats and 30.0% chickens. The animals used are cooked, often in a special way,
               and shared by participants.</p>

<p>Among the several ceremonies performed around the year, it is worth to highlighting

<p>Almost all families celebrate some kind of worships before or/and after harvest the
               main agricultural production and they do that mainly as a household or family
               ceremony and more than of half of them as a more large communal ceremony (<a href="#t13">Table 13</a>).</p>

<p>Beside the main vegetable production, cattle and buffalos are also subject to worship
               and these occur mainly in Tapo-Tas which is in the mountain and the most rural of

<p>In all districts the communities still perform a set of rituals with a "propitiatory"
               nature (before sowing, after harvest, in the case of pests, to ask for rain or to ask
               to stop the rain ...) and even technological innovations from outside the community
               have to be integrated into the local culture, such as the ritual of <em>Fasi
                  karau</em> ain (washing the feet of the buffalo) that in the district Viqueque
               continues to be done, not only to animals but also to tractors (<sup><a href="#B19">MIRANDA, 2011</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Beyond the prayers, songs, dances and other gifts as gold, money and areca, the
               people proceed to the sacrifice of animals to offer to the spirits or to see in his
               bowels how the harvest will be.</p>
<p>This practice highlights the importance of the investment that is made in
               agriculture, despite the low number of animals that each family has, they do not fail
               to meet their ritual obligations, providing animals for communal feasts or
               sacrifices, in order to try to ensure a good harvest. As gift/scarified in
               ceremonies, the animals most used are chicken and pigs (<a href="#t15">Table 15</a>). The buffalos are used only by about 3% of the
               households.</p>

            </p>
<p>If we compare these findings with the past documents seems that buffalos are losing
               importance but according our informants the decreased in using Buffalos in ceremonies
               is not because they are not important and desirable but due to the fact that they are
               very expensive and only affordable on very rare occasions and for very few families.
               This idea confirmed the description made by Claudine Friedberg: she mentioned that
               "During my presence, these rituals were no longer performed, undoubtedly because one
               no longer could afford them" referring the 'cooling' ritual in which a piglet and a
               goat were traditional slaughtered (<sup><a href="#B14">FRIEDBERG,
                  1989</a></sup>).</p>

<a name="idp5832736"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">4 <strong>Conclusions</strong>
         </p>
<p>In sum, we can identify in the literature written about Timor-Leste and in our research
            that livestock had in the paste and has nowadays different functions for Timor-Leste
            households.</p>
<p>Nowadays, livestock is seldom used on agricultural works, such as buffalos and horse in
            rice land preparation, but the manure is often used as organic fertilizer. As a mean of
            transportation, horses are still used, mainly in mountainous regions, but much less than
            were in the past. However, when families do not have another mean of transport, use the
            animals mainly for cargo.</p>
<p>Regarding consumption, livestock species are a source of protein for Timorese even
            though the consumption of meat is not done in a daily basis. The livestock species used
            for self-consumption are mainly small animals, chickens, pigs and goats. At present,
            milk from local production is not drunk, although in past times buffalo milk was
            consumed, but this use was lost during the independence war. The Timor-Leste people use
            the black and white horns of the buffalos to manufacture articles such as dolls,
            utensils of ménage and adornments.</p>
<p>Concerning domestic finances, animals are very important as a mean of asset savings that
            can be converted into cash when family needs arise. In many rural regions, livestock
            stocks are a source of asset accumulation. This source can be mobilized to satisfy some
            unexpected expenditures such as children school fees, bride wealth, illness, etc. Cattle
            are owned as an index of wealth, outward sign of wealth, often created by mere
            ostentation, without the intention to extract from it any net income. This ownership
            largely determines social status in village communities.</p>
<p>Among the social functions, one is the use of animals for the fulfillment of a set of
            rituals and social obligations (funerals, ritual slaughter, bride wealth) of families
            and communities, either formal and informal. The most relevant animals for traditional
            ceremonies and festivities "estilos" are pigs and cattle followed by chicken and
            goats.</p>
<p>From our observations, interviews and talks with local people, it is worthwhile to
            mention the importance given by households to the livestock social functions. However,
            many of these functions are often ignored when estimating the total contribution of
            livestock to wealth and wellbeing of Timor-Leste households. The economic value of the
            livestock social functions are difficult to evaluate and specific research needs to be
            done in order to better understand and assess the role of livestock in the wellbeing and
            in development of rural communities in Timor-Leste and to quantify its economic
            value.</p>

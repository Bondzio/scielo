This text is divided in two sections. The first one analyzes the hypothesis according to which the diagnoses and responses to the current social changes not only stir the scientific and technical skills of individuals and of social groups, but also their basic systems of value. The ethical decision is prior to the definition of political strategies. The second part of the text explores the most appropriate political strategies to break the social determinism of learning results. In this sense, both policies of early attention to children and of pedagogical change strategies are mentioned, with a special emphasis on the so-called "subjective policies".

The author analyses the development of the political scene in the economic globalisation context, defending an affirmative way of making politics on the part of ecologists. In emphasising the activistsÂ’ ability of rereading the most important occidental ideologies, the author proposes a possible classification of actual ecological politics. Finally, he also points out a dilemma experienced by the greens: there is no political central command from the State, and usually the greens respond as figures of technical agencies in the national, regional and local governmental spheres.

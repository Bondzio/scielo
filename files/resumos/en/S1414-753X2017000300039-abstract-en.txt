Abstract This study aimed to analyze the socio-economic, demographic, health and climatic vulnerabilities in the ABC Paulista region that comprises the municipalities of Santo André, São Caetano do Sul, São Bernardo do Campo, Mauá, Diadema, Rio Grande da Serra and Ribeirão Pires. The vulnerabilities were analyzed through the construction of indices based on the aggregation of indicators collected in the IBGE census and climate indices of extreme rainfall. The municipalities of Diadema and Mauá were identified as the most vulnerable areas to heavy rains, presenting an increasing trend of days with moderate and intense rainfall (50 mm and 80 mm). In addition, these municipalities presented higher socio-economic and urban-demographic vulnerabilities, as a consequence of asymmetric social and economic development, poor environmental management and accelerated unplanned urbanization. Therefore, all these issues contributed to enhance the impact of heavy rains.

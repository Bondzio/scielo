At first, the   paper offers a brief historic overview of military spending in Latin America,   emphasizing South America's last decade. In the following section, the longest   of them all, an analytical map of military spending on armaments in six South   American countries (Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Argentina) is   presented, giving special attention to what kind of weapons is being purchased,   from whom they are being purchased, and which are the factors that motivate and   allow such purchases. Finally, the paper seeks to identify trends for the   second decade of the new millennium. Although this paper analyzes data referent   to the first decade of the 2000s, particular attention is placed to the period   2003-2007, since it represents a turning point in arms purchases for South American   countries.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Introduction (setting the context)</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Military expenditures in Latin American countries   (that is, countries geographically situated in both South and Central America)   amount to US$ 60.4 billion (in 2007 constant prices) in 2010<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a>.   From 2003 to 2007, expenditure of this nature increased at an annual rate of   6%, a low amount if compared to other regions of the world. The analyzed data   indicates a pattern of spending during the first decade of the millennium: In   South America, military expenditure constantly grew while in Central America   numbers remained virtually constant. The lowest spending year in South America   (1999) accounted for 86% of the region's expenditure; the highest-spending year   (2007) accounted for 97%. It is important to underline once again, however,   that these figures are still quite low if compared to other so-called   peripheral regions of the international system such as Asia and the Middle   East, and are incomparable to the huge amount of resources allocated by "first   world" regions like North America and Western Europe. In Latin America, South   American countries are responsible for the largest increases in military   spending during the 2003-2007 period, Venezuela (78.53%), Chile (53%), and   Ecuador (49%) being the main responsible countries. It is also in South America   where are the countries with higher military budgets in the region: Brazil,   which accounts for 46% of expenditures; Colombia, which accounts for 15%; and   Chile, with 13%.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> South America alone accounts for   US$ 39.6 billion of the US$ 44 billion invested in the   military in 2007. What could explain such an increasing pattern during the   mentioned years? The rise of military spending coincides with a series of three   consecutive years of strong economic growth in South America (2004-2006, at an   average rate of approximately 5.3%)<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a>,     a phenomenon experienced last in the 1970s, when average rates were close     to 7%. Although growth had declined in 2007 to 4.9%, some of the strongest   economies, like Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela, maintained their rates   considerably high: 8.7%, 5.3%, 5.1%, and 8.4%, respectively<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a>.   On the other hand, the positive economic performance was also accompanied by an   increase in macroeconomic indicators in almost all major countries in this   sub-region: inflation, fiscal adjustments, and public debt reduction, combined   with high flows of foreign capital that had an impact on dollar devaluation   policies.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on that, some experts have interpreted South   America's interest in increasing military spending over the past five years as   the result of high levels of economic growth, a stronger currency due to the   devaluation of the dollar - which stimulates import practices -, and   political will to modernize the armed forces of the sub-region, which have   obsolete arms stockpile<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notwithstanding, is it enough to claim an arms race in   South America based on the fact that there is an increase in investment   numbers? Indeed, reactions coming from some countries may suggest a movement in   that direction, raising concern about this possibility; for instance, Colombia   concerns with Venezuela's arms purchases, particularly regarding uncertainty   about the "ultimate consumers" of such products. Thus, the Colombian government   has come to favor mechanisms for monitoring Venezuelan arms purchases<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a>.   Bolivia and Peru have also expressed concern with increasing on armaments   spending by Chile. As points out a study by Gustavo Guti&eacute;rrez, "&#91;&hellip;&#93; military   expenditure, measured in US dollars, in relation to the GDP shows &#91;&hellip;&#93; a great   amount of spending by Chile in a program to modernize the Army, which   effectively raises suspicion and alarms its neighbors &#91;&hellip;&#93;."<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> This paper, however, does not intend to discuss whether or not there is an   "arms race" in South America, but to systematize information that can   substantiate such debate by mapping military expenditure in countries of the   region that maintain Armed Forces with complex structures and that purchase   sophisticated weaponry, drawing tendencies for this entering decade.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>An outlook of weapons' purchases in South America</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 2005, Chile and Venezuela (and, to a lesser   extent, Brazil) had the greatest increase in weapons imports among South American   countries, giving rise to the delicate question of whether their excessive   concern with modernizing the armed forces could not have the negative effect of   fueling an arms race in the region and destabilizing governments by   transferring part of the acquired arsenal to national or regional non-state   groups. The Venezuelan case has drawn the most attention.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute   (SIPRI) published in the summer of 2008 its annual balance report of export,   import and transfer of weapons around the world accounting for numbers of the   previous year. Interestingly, for the first time, SIPRI's report devoted a   whole chapter to analyze the purchase and transfer of arms in South America. At   SIPRI Yearbook 2008, emphasis is given to three countries: Brazil, Chile, and   Venezuela. In a medium-term analysis, SIPRI showed a percentage increase in   arms transfers in South America: "States of South America accounted for 5% of   the volume of international transfers of conventional weapons imported for the   period 2003-2007 - and 47% higher than in 1998-2002."<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a> These acquisitions could be transforming South America in an "emerging arms   market." For example, in the cases of Chile and Venezuela, the volume of   conventional weapons imported from Russia and Britain could turn them into a   market equivalent to other regions of the world such as North Africa. Not   surprisingly, countries that export conventional weapons - Russia in   particular - have pointed out that the economic success and obsolescence   of weapons systems in Latin America offer good opportunities for the sale of   new military equipment<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several important questions are essential to be   considered when dealing with military spending budgets. In accordance to the   methodology designed by Red Atlas de Seguridad y Defensa de Am&eacute;rica Latina   (RESDAL), these questions are: 1) which countries spend on weapons;   2) what resources are being spent on; 3) why countries decide to   spend on arms (motivation); and 4) how military expenditure is funded<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup>12</sup></a>.   Answers to these questions may give a more or less dramatic tone to the issue   of arms purchases in the region. In the next sections, South American countries   with large military structures - Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru,   and Venezuela - become the focus of attention in order to answer the   first, third, and fourth questions above mentioned<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><sup>13</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is disagreement among sources when it comes to   recognize Venezuela as the main arms investor in South America if it is   considered the relation between military expenditure/GDP. During the period   2000-2009 the country only invested 1.4% of its GDP in military expenditure.   The fact is that "Venezuela has increased   dramatically its weapon imports &#91;and&#93; moved from 56<sup>th</sup> position in   the period 1998-2002 to the 24<sup>th</sup> position &#91;in the period 2003-2007&#93;,   becoming the largest regional importer."<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><sup>14</sup></a> In 2007 alone, Venezuela increased its defense budget by 78% (reaching   US$ 887 million), becoming the greatest spender in real terms in   South America that year<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><sup>15</sup></a>. Such an amount,   however, was lower than the amount of weapons imported by Chile in 2003-2007:   Venezuela spent US$ 1,417 billion against US$ 2,283 billion   spent by Chile. Several years of constant increase in oil prices, political   will from President Ch&aacute;vez to improve the country's military capabilities, and   presidential will to boost Venezuela's political position in the region have   led the country to larger increments in its military capacities.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A remarkable fact is   that in recent years there has been a considerable distance between the   original military budget set and the actual yearly spending in Venezuela. This   may explain why in 2006 and 2007 Venezuela ranked fourth and eighth   respectively among developing countries, receiving more delivery of weapons and   having signed more arms transfer agreements.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>16</sup></a> The discrepancy between actual and expected budget spending is a consequence of   legal mechanisms that allow additional allocation of resources to the military   during     a fiscal year. The most relevant of such mechanisms is called Paraguas Act     (Ley Paraguas, in Spanish). This legal instrument, that dates back many years,   allows the government to negotiate foreign loans to finance extra military   spendings not always included in the initial budget, although the government   has announced its intention to limit the application of the Act or even to   eliminate it altogether.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><sup>17</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, what kind   of weapons is Venezuela buying and which countries or groups is it buying from?   Between 2005 and 2007, there was a big jump in Venezuelan weapons purchases,   estimated at US$ 4 billion, most of it coming from Russia. Since   2005, Venezuela has purchased from Russia 100,000 Kalashnikov automatic   rifles AK-47, 24 Sukhoi Su-30MK fighter aircrafts, 10 MI-35 combat   helicopters, approximately 40 Mi-17-V multitasking transport, and 3 Mi-26   heavy transport helicopters<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>18</sup></a>. In 2007, two new   agreements on arms purchases were signed with Russia. According to these   documents, Venezuela would receive a package of 5 Kilo-class   diesel-electric submarines and possibly ground missiles and long-range S-Type   Club. Venezuela also bought in the same period from China   3 three-dimensional JYl radars<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><sup>19</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It should be noted   that the trend that puts Russia as the main supplier of weapons to Venezuela   was consolidated over the comprised years being considered here. From 2003 to   2007, Russia provided 93% of the weapons bought by Venezuela while China and   Israel represent 3% and 2% of the total of arms imports, respectively<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><sup>20</sup></a>. In practice some of the weapons systems   purchased from Russia supplement purchases made from China. For example,   Venezuela probably acquired from Russia a ground-air Tor-M1 missile system.   According to the country's Ministry of Defense, three Chinese radars -   also purchased - will support the functions of the Russian system and even   the Sukhoi aircraft fighters. In sum, Venezuela in 2007 was the third largest   market to Russia's arms exports in the world (accounting for 5%, although this   percentage is well below the 45% Russia exported to China and the 22% Russia   exported to India)<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><sup>21</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US embargo on   arms transferring to Venezuela probably had the undesirable impact for the   United States of Venezuela turning to Russia as its weapons supplier. In 2006,   the US State Department imposed an embargo that prevents Venezuela from   importing goods and services of Defense nature. In the same year, Venezuela was   certified by the US government, under Section 40A of the Arms and Control Act   (AECA), as a country "not fully cooperative" in the fight against terrorism.   The AECA certification was renewed in 2007 and 2008. By this mechanism,   Venezuela is not allowed any assistance, sale or financing by the US military.   In practice, the US embargo on arms sales has led representatives of the   Venezuelan armed forces to pressure the executive to look for alternative   import markets. Several arms-producing countries are alert to Venezuela's air   force plans to buy other types of aircraft attached to the Sukhois purchased   from Russia.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Actually, the result   of the US arms embargo has not been much different than expected. Combined with   Venezuelan armed forces interest in buying weapons, the embargo was a strong   incentive for the establishment of closer relations between Russia and   Venezuela beyond<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><sup>22</sup></a> the commercial   aspect of purchase/sale of weapons. During 2008, both countries took more   concrete steps in that direction. In the first half of that year, on his third   visit to Russia since the beginning of his presidential term, Ch&aacute;vez confirmed   his intention to promote strategic partnerships with Russia including energy   cooperation and even the possibility of installing two Russian weapons   factories in Venezuela<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><sup>23</sup></a>. In the subsequent   years, new agreements on weapons (which would include the Su-35 and   Su-39 combat aircraft; the An-74 cargo aircraft; the II-76 and Mi-28 combat   helicopters; and Kilo-class submarines) were discussed, even though no   agreement was signed until late 2007<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><sup>24</sup></a>. During these years, Venezuela also   considered acquiring 24 Sukhoi SU-30 fighters in the BM version.   Additionally, Venezuela signed a US$ 2 billion contract with Russia   that includes the purchase of 4 submarines type 636, 10 Ilyushin   76MD-90 and 1 Ilyushin 78MK transport aircrafts, 2 tankers, and   10 attack Mil Mi-28NE helicopters. The Air Force has incorporated 18   training Chinese K-8 aircrafts, and the Army is in the process of finalizing   the purchase of about 100 Russian T-72 and T-90 MBT, and wheeled or   tracked armored troop carriers<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>25</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This deal was followed by the announcement of the   Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Russian warships would hold joint   exercises with Venezuela's navy, an initiative interpreted by analysts as a   message to United States<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>26</sup></a>. The first concrete step towards this   "strategic partnership" was given in September 2008 when two Russian Tu-160   supersonic bombers arrived in Venezuela to carry out military exercises in   international waters (the first exercise of military nature of a Latin American   country with Russia since the end of the Cold War)<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>27</sup></a>.The   Russian Defense Ministry announced, though, that after undertaking the   scheduled training, the aircraft would return to its home base<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><sup>28</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, pressures from the US government on   arms-producing countries such as Spain, Brazil, and France have also had the   unintended effect of inducing Russia to enter on the Venezuelan market.   Pressure from the US prevented the finalization of an agreement signed by   Venezuela and Spain in the second half of 2005 for the purchase of two patrol   boats type 10C and a 296 CN-235 transport aircraft. The US claimed that   marketing authorization was required since both the aircraft and the patrol   boats would be manufactured with technology of US origin. That same year, an   agreement between the Brazilian company Embraer and the Venezuelan government   for the acquisition of ALX and AMX-T Super Tucano aircrafts (a light attack   training aircraft) also failed to be carried out due to the blocking position   of the US for the same reason it had interfered in the transaction with Spain.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><sup>29</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chile is another country that stands out in its   efforts to acquire weapons of modern technology to re-equip its armed forces.   In the period 2003-2007, Chile became the largest importer of (conventional)   weapons in the South American region. Chile held the 36<sup>th</sup> position   in the world ranking of weapons recipient in the period 1998-2002; however,   during 2003-2007, the country moved to the 12<sup>th</sup> position (the   highest position among Latin American countries<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><sup>30</sup></a>).   Chile has also been the only Latin American country to maintain throughout the   first decade of the 2000s its military spending above 3.5% of its GDP, except   for the year 2007, in which it was exceeded by Venezuela.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 2003 to 2007, Chile's main import market for   conventional arms was the European Union, accounting for 82% of the country's   weapons imports, followed by the United States, accounting for 15%, and Israel,   with 3%<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><sup>31</sup></a>. As some analysts suggest, choosing   Western countries as its main supplier can be explained by Chile's intentions   to acquire NATO standard military status and certainly the strategic   partnership that the country intends to strengthen with the US in the coming   decades in the political, economic, and military domains.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><sup>32</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a short-term analysis, in 2007 Chile appears as the   main South American importer of arms from Britain, occupying, alongside   Romania, the second place in Britain's list of global arms exports (9% of its   total exports of weapons for both countries). The dynamism of Chilean arms   imports was reflected in the growth of 23% of its military budget in 2007.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><sup>33</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chilean constant level of military expenditure has   been made possible by two circumstances. First, the country's good economic   performance in the first decade of the century. To illustrate, between 2004 and   2007, Chilean GDP grew at an average annual rate of 6.2%. Second, Chilean armed   forces still benefit from the Copper Law, an act that dates from the 1950s<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><sup>34</sup></a>.   In addition, during the Augusto Pinochet military regime, the government   regulated that 10% of copper exports were to be directed to the funding of   military equipment purchases and operational expenses<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><sup>35</sup></a>.   It should be noted that Chile is the world's first copper exporter and its   commodity prices in the international market have experienced a steep growth   over the first decade of the 2000s.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><sup>36</sup></a> According to some calculations, the   Copper Law contributed, for many years, with an annual average of   US$ 200 million to the military budget. Due to the increase in   international prices, it is estimated that the Law alone contributes with   US$ 1 billion to the military budget, leading to strong pressure from   political and social sectors in Chile to revise or abolish the act. The   increase of 23% in the military budget in 2007 was a preventive action in   response to the existence of these social and political pressures emphasizing   the need to abolish or reform the Law. These sectors advocate for military   spending to be financed by the regular or general fiscal year budget<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><sup>37</sup></a>.   In short, "&#91;t&#93;he key to the increase in Chilean military spending is the steep   rise of international copper prices in recent years. The Copper Law implemented   in 1958 and later amended during the 17-year dictatorship of Gen. Augusto   Pinochet stipulates that the Armed Forces are automatically granted 10% of all   sales (not profits) made by the state-owned Codelco, the world's biggest copper   producing company."<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><sup>38</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this past decade, Chile has purchased very   sophisticated and technologically advanced weaponry. Among them, were   10 new US super-sophisticated combat aircraft F-16C, 18 second-hand   and 18 new F16 MLU from the Netherlands<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><sup>39</sup></a>. Chile has   also invested heavily in its navy, receiving 2 new Scorpene-class   submarines, built by France and Spain; 2 Doorman frigates and   2 Heemskerck Van Holland frigates coming from the Netherlands; and in 2009   it was waiting for the arrival of 3 23-type frigates of the former Royal   Navy. Chile also signed a contract with Germany to acquire 136 second-hand   Leopard-2 tanks delivered in 2009. The country's missile arsenal has also been   modernized: the American AIM-9M Sidewinder, AIM-120 AMRAAM, Harpoon and Sea   Sparrow are being acquired. From Israel, Chile is buying the Python and Derby   missiles, as well as smart bombs of various calibers. At the end of the decade,   Chile also incorporated 12 A-29 Embraer Super Tucano training aircrafts   and 12 new Bell 412EP helicopters to its military fleet. Recently,   3 batteries of air-defense system NASAMS were purchased, as well as about   40 8x8 armored Stryker for the Marines, 2 KC-135E aircrafts for   transport and refueling planes, 1 4-C maritime patrol aircraft 295MPA,   4 C-295MPA maritime patrol aircraft, and 5 Russian Mil Mi-17SP   helicopters<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><sup>40</sup></a>. Chile ranked third among Latin   American nations in military expenditure in 2008, spending   US$ 6 billion, following Brazil (US$ 23.3 billion) and   Colombia (US$ 9.1 billion). However, on a per capita basis, Chile by   far outspent both countries, since its population is (approximately)   17 million, compared to Brazil's 195 million and Colombia's   46 million<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><sup>41</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In regard to Colombia, some of its politicians have   raised concerns about the possibility of an arms race in South America,   pointing out to a weaponry disadvantage especially in view of the recent arms   purchases made by Venezuela. Thus, Colombia, following the steps of other South   American countries, announced in 2008 an impressive US$ 28 billion   plan to modernize its armed forces, giving priority to upgrade their combat   aircrafts Mirage and Kfir. The plan also provided for the purchase of new and   modern combat aircrafts, helicopters, and armored vehicles, and an increase in   army and police personnel, estimated at 36,000 people<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><sup>42</sup></a>.   The first step to put the plan in practice was taken in 2007 when Colombia   announced an increase in its military budget of US$ 3,370 billion for   the following year, the largest increase in more than 30 years<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><sup>43</sup></a>.   Fighting drug trafficking and anti-insurgent paramilitary groups was the   argument used by the government to justify the investment on the military.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, Colombia's expenditures on arms purchase in   terms of percentage of its GDP reveal a paradox. While the country has spent   considerably little on arms purchases in the 2003-2007 period compared to its   South American neighbors Chile and Venezuela, Colombia maintained the second   highest military spending in the region. The numbers for expenditure on arms   purchase for the period (US$ 210 million) are far lower than Chile,   Venezuela or even Brazil's acquisitions in the same period. In fact, Colombia   spent 3.6% of its GDP on military expenditure in 2000-2009, the highest   percentage in Latin America. Except for Chile, which spent 3.5% of its GDP   during these years, the rest of South American countries spent less than 2%.   The main suppliers of arms to Colombia during the period 2003-2008 were the   United States (39%), Spain (26.2%), Brazil (17%), Italy (5.2%), and Canada (4.5%).   It is remarkable that Colombia is the only South American country that has in   another Latin American country - Brazil - one of its main import   markets of weapons.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To unravel the existing discrepancy between armaments   purchases and a relatively high percentage of GDP spent on defense it is   necessary to look at the structure of military spending funding sources. In   addition to the defense budget, the Colombian government receives a war tax   from cities and provinces (generating a revenue of approximately   US$ 400 million a year) complemented by a new tax, announced in 2007,   expected to enhance in US$ 43.6 billion the government revenue by   2010.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><sup>44</sup></a> Despite that, Colombia depends heavily   on US military aid. Actually, Colombia receives the largest amount of US aid in   Latin America and that aid is not accounted for in the military budget of each   fiscal year. So Colombia is investing in armaments, but the source of such   expenditure does not appear directly in the military budget. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US has prioritized Colombia in military assistance   programs such as the Foreign Military Financing of the State Department, the   International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, and particularly through   initiatives such as Plan Colombia and the Andean Counterdrug Strategy<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><sup>45</sup></a>.   Colombia became, at the beginning of the new millennium, one of the main   recipients of US military aid around the world. In the years 2003-2007, thanks   to the above mentioned programs, US military aid to the country ranged from   US$ 550 million to US$ 650 million per year. In other   words, US military aid to Colombia is a contemporary version for Latin America   of the "military umbrella" policy. Compared to US military assistance to any   other country in the Southern Hemisphere, US military aid to Colombia is   notably higher. Its impact on Colombia military structure is evident. For   instance, much of the military equipment, including the modern Black Hawk   helicopters, purchased by Colombia between 2000 and 2007, was only made   possible due to US military assistance, particularly by means of anti-narcotics   programs and Plan Colombia (which, since 2000, has allocated 80% of its   US$ 4.5 billion budget to military assistance, including purchases of   military equipment). Only one lot of Black Hawks was purchased with Colombian   military budget in the past decade<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><sup>46</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, Colombia has not acquired sophisticated   weaponry if compared to Chile and Venezuela's acquisitions. There is not many   equipment today that can be compared to the Sukhoi acquired by Venezuela, or   the F-16s purchased by Chile. In recent years, Colombia acquired UH-60L Black   Hawk helicopters and bought a Beech B-300 aircraft converted to an air   intelligence aircraft, and various units of the Super Tucano A-29 manufactured   by Embraer in Brazil. The Air Force bought 13 used Kfir C10 aircrafts from   Israel to rebuild its fighter force. The Colombian government agreed to   participate in the design of a new KC-390 transport aircraft projected by   Embraer and initially intends to acquire up to 12 units of the model<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><sup>47</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Any overview of the South American region in terms of   total military spending or spending on arms purchases must necessarily take   into account the role of Brazil due to the increased complexity of its economy,   the relative relevance of its GDP in the region (around 56%), and the greater   complexity of their global and regional policy goals. Notwithstanding, in   2003-2007, Brazil reduced its international performance as an importer of   conventional weapons. The country occupied the 32<sup>nd</sup> position in a   world rank in the period 1998-2002, and dropped to the 33<sup>rd</sup> position   in 2003-2007. This decrease was offset by a considerable increase in military   budget (more than 33%) in 2007, by far the most significant in a decade. This   explains why Brazil, which occupied the 14<sup>th</sup> position in 2006 among   countries with increased military spending, and rose to the 12<sup>th</sup> position in 2007<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><sup>48</sup></a>. Brazil occupied, in 2010, the 30<sup>th</sup> position in the world ranking of weapons importers. "However, the elect   Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has delayed awarding a   US$ 2 billion contract for advanced combat aircraft and a   US$ 6 billion contract for frigates and offshore patrol vessels   (OPVs)."<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><sup>49</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, attention must be paid to the fact that   Brazilian military spending of nearly US$ 70 billion in the period   2003-2007 is diluted by the size of its economy: for 2007, the country's GDP   was around US$ 1.5 trillion (or R$ 2.5 trillion<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><sup>50</sup></a>).   Taking into account the relation military spending/GDP, Brazil spends little on   defense (1.6% of its GDP) when compared to Colombia (3.5%) or Chile (3.5%), and   only slightly more than Argentina (0.96%) and Peru (1.3%). In the period   2003-2007, on average, 1.5% of Brazil's GDP were directed to military   expenditure. It should also be taken into account, however, that in spite of   defense budget growing an average 15% between 2004 and 2007, only 4% of the   budget can be allocated to new equipment acquisitions and armament upgrade. The   rest of the budget is spent primarily on military personnel, including expenses   with pensions. Therefore, the actual spending in equipment and weapons upgrade   in the period 2003-2007 was of US$ 818 million, lower than Chile's   and Venezuela's investments.</font></p>       <p><a name="fig01" id="fig01"></a></p>       <p>&nbsp;</p>       <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rbpi/v55n2/a03fig01.jpg"></p>       <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding the institutional aspect, Brazil does not   have any extra-budget mechanisms like Chile, Colombia and Venezuela. The   military budget is based on the Budget Act (Lei Or&ccedil;ament&aacute;ria, in Portuguese)   approved by the National Congress annually. The Budget Act, however, allows   regular military budget to be complemented throughout the year. For 2010,   R$ 1.5 billion (US$ 853 million) from the Budget Act was   allocated to the Ministry of Defense to improve the existent airspace control   system and to develop airport infrastructure.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><sup>51</sup></a> Along with   many other countries in the region, Brazil has in recent years started on a   program to modernize and upgrade its armed forces. The 2008 National Defense   Strategy announced plans to boost Brazil's military capabilities and to   invigorate its domestic arms industry through a series of acquisitions which   includes significant volumes of technology transfer. In 2010, in a first step   towards implementing the National Defense Strategy, the National Congress   approved a project to restructure the armed forces that foresees the creation   of a Joint General Staff to work under the authority of the Ministry of   Defense. In this same direction, a draft proposal to Brazil's first Defense   White Paper was issued in 2011. According to this document, every four years   the government will have to submit to the National Congress detailed   information on its defense policies and strategies along with plans to a   continued modernization of the armed forces<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><sup>52</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Brazilian Navy plans to purchase at least 33 modern   ships by 2025 in order to make patrolling of maritime boundaries more   effective. However, some projects, such as the development of the Brazilian   nuclear submarine, have been delayed to meet more pressing demands such as the   modernization of existing ships. Thus, in 2006 a further postponement of the   project (which had its first impulse almost 30 years ago) was announced   and the Navy stated its intentions to give priority to the modernization of the   existing Type-209 submarine and the construction of a submarine (Type 214)   using German technology. In any case, the nuclear submarine project received a   strong stimulus when the Brazilian government announced in mid-2007 its plan to   invest US$ 1 billion over an eight-year period in buying German   and/or French technology for the construction of a reactor, which is linked up   to the submarine project.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Brazilian Air Force has experienced lack of   resources just as the Navy. For instance, the Ministry of Defense produced an   ambitious project in 2002 called the FX Project, reissued in 2007. The project   proposes to buy initially 36 modern aircraft fighters, reaching more than   100 by 2020, to replace the outdated Mirage, the AMX attack and tactical F-5BR   that Brazil maintains<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><sup>53</sup></a>. At the end of the decade, the   Brazilian Air Force received the first batch of the three acquired Russian   attack Mil Mi-35M helicopters. The Air Force has also ordered 4 more units   of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, plus 8 units of CASA C-295 transport   aircrafts, and signed a contract with Embraer to purchase 28 units of the   new KC-390 transport aircraft<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><sup>54</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In October 2008, the Air Force announced the three   finalists companies - all of which are Western<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><sup>55</sup></a> -   competing to provide the new generation of combat aircrafts to the Brazilian   military. A contract for their acquisition would be signed in 2009 and   delivered in 2014. Thanks to that, the Ministry of Defense would see its budget   increased for a long time. For that, an important decision should have been   taken in 2009, when the National Budget Act would provide   US$ 50.2 billion for the Defense. Of this total, US$ 10.9 billion   is to be allocated for direct investment in the Army, Navy and the Air Force<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><sup>56</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 2003 to 2007, Brazil bought most part of its   weaponry from the European Union (64%), followed by the United States (17%) and   Canada (7%)<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><sup>57</sup></a>. Some analysis suggests that it is not   by chance that Brazil, like Chile, has given preference to Western suppliers,   with special interest in NATO members, rather than Russia or China. That would   be a deliberate selection, following a rationality involving "strategic   choice": its emergence as a regional power in the next decade does not seem to   predict a relationship of rivalry with the West, but on the contrary, a   partnership for regional security plans<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><sup>58</sup></a>. It should be   noted, however, that due to domestic political conditions and financial   difficulties, Brazil has bought second-hand weapons. Thus the country bought   12 used Mirage 2000C from France, which were delivered into three batches   of 4 aircrafts in 2006, 2007 and 2008. From Spain, the country bought   12 new C-295M transport aircrafts, which were delivered by the end of   2008, and 2 Lockheed P-3 Orion aircrafts set up for maritime surveillance.   Brazil also acquired 9 F-5E aircrafts from Saudi Arabia and has a project   to purchase 240 Leopard 1A5 tanks to the Army (having already received the   first two lots)<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><sup>59</sup></a>. From the Brazilian private company   Embraer, the government has purchased 50 Super Tucano EBM-314 training and   combat aircrafts and, to cater to the Army, signed a contract to purchase   2,044 units of armored wheeled transport VBTP, now dubbed Guarani, in   different versions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are two other South American countries that have   important regional armed forces in the region and have shown willingness to   modernize its military structures in the coming years: Peru and Argentina. The   case of Peru, whose former president Alan Garcia announced in 2007 plans to   invest over US$ 1 billion in modernizing the armed forces<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><sup>60</sup></a>,   is of particular importance since, following Brazil, Peru is the country that   has numerically the largest armed forces in South America<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><sup>61</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Peru's military spending in the period 2000-2009   remained almost constant, on an average 1.4% of its GDP, and its military   budget virtually coincided the original expected expenditures with its real   one. Figures show that Peru is one of South American countries with lower   spending numbers on arms imports. That can be explained by two situations: the   many severe economic crises that affected Peru in the past decade, and the   decision to buy a small number of sophisticated weaponry, at least during the   period 2003-2007. The country acquired in 2007 two used Lupo class frigates and   expects two more from the Italian Navy. Up to now, Peru has no (public) plans   to acquire sophisticated military weapons in the short term. Thus, as only 30%   of its combat aircrafts are in operational conditions<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><sup>62</sup></a>,   priority falls on maintenance and modernization of weaponry bought in the 1980s   and 1990s, especially the IKL 209/1200 submarines and the French Mirage 2000.   Peru also signed with Russian companies an agreement to maintain operational   their Mig-29 and Mi-17 fighters, and their An-32 helicopters<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><sup>63</sup></a>.   Peru acquired two Fokker 60 MPA maritime patrol aircrafts from the Netherlands   inventory in order to strengthen fight against the Shining Path guerrillas. The   government also ordered 8 new Russian attack helicopters Mil Mi-35P, and   6 Russian Mil Mi-17SP for transportation. This probably means that Peru   will continue to make efforts for keeping markets that in the past have been   suppliers of its advanced weaponry, especially France and Russia. Peru,   contrary to the case of Brazil, Chile and Venezuela, is not facing its imports   market as "strategic choices," but as a commercial safe choice.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, following the trend of several South American   countries (especially Chile and Venezuela<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><sup>64</sup></a>), Peru uses   its natural resources sales as a source of military funding. In its efforts to   modernize the armed forces, Peru created a defense fund in 2005 subsidized by   income derived from the exploitation of hydrocarbons<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><sup>65</sup></a> (especially from gas). Thus, given the excellent oil prices in the international   market, part of the designed modernization program of the Peruvian armed forces   is expected to be funded during the second term of president Alan Garcia   (2007-2011). Income from armed forces properties will provide complementary   funding.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><sup>66</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Argentina, on the other hand, is a curious case. No   doubt the country represents one of the most vigorous cases of political and   economic development in South American region at present. However, even though   during Nestor Kirchner's administration (2003-2007) macroeconomic indices   suggested an average growth of over 8% a year, Argentina presents low levels of   military expenditure (in 2008, it reached a floor of 0.8% of the GDP, against   1.1% in 2000) and has not stated any future plans for major investments in   military equipment<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><sup>67</sup></a>. Thus, Argentina experienced a   decrease of 1.6% in its military budget in 2004, losing the position of fourth   biggest military spender in the region that it occupied then. Similar rates of   decrease during the next following two years (2005 and 2006) made Argentina   lose further positions in the regional military ranking, especially to Peru and   Colombia<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><sup>68</sup></a>. For the period 2000-2009, in terms of   military spending/GDP, Argentina's military budget, compared to other South   America countries, was only greater than Paraguay, which allocated an average   0.9% of its GDP. It was lower even than Uruguay, who spent an average 1.5% of   GDP in the same period. Of course, these figures cannot lose sight that, in   absolute terms, Argentina's budget is several times higher than that of   Paraguay and Uruguay. One example that shows how the political and financial   crisis during the early first decade of the new century negatively affected the   purchase of advanced weaponry in Argentina is the impressive fact that the last   purchase Argentina did until 2008 was a Bell-212/UH-1N helicopter in 2000<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><sup>69</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly, besides the economic crises at the beginning   of the decade, the memory of the violent years of military dictatorship in the   country also accounts as an important factor in explaining why civil   governments in Argentina invest so little in military modernization. Thus, from   2003 to 2007, Argentina acquired AIM-9M Sidewinder missiles, bought second-hand   units of Mirage 2000C, and with its own technology built a Corvette, the Meko   140.<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><sup>70</sup></a> Under the government of Cristina Kirchner,   Argentina undertook the modernization of UH-1 helicopters and light attack   IA-58 Pucara aircrafts, extending their operational life for at least another   ten years. Two units of Russian helicopter Mil Mi-17V were acquired to   undertake operations in Antarctica.<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><sup>71</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In mid-2007, though, the government announced a more   comprehensive modernization program of its armed forces<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><sup>72</sup></a>,   including purchases from France (traditional supplier of Argentina in the   past), Ukraine, and Russia. From France, Argentina intends to acquire   second-hand Mirage 2000 C/Ds and Mica and Exocet missiles; from Ukraine, an   An-70/72 transport aircraft to replace the old C-130. These purchases were,   however, by the end of the first decade, still a plan, and it seems that   Cristina Kirchner's government will further postpone the modernization project   of Argentinean military.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In short, Chile was the largest import of conventional   weapons in 2006-2010 and the 12<sup>th</sup> largest in the world, and the   total volume of transfers to the region increased by nearly 150%. Venezuela's   arms imports are likely to remain high in the next years. Other states in South   America, including Argentina, Colombia, and Peru are engaged in more modest   efforts. Orders for Brazil arms imports increased by 436% between the periods   2001-2005 and 2006-2010, driven in large part by licensed production deals with   France for 4 Scorpene submarines, 1 SBNR and 50 EC-725   helicopters<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><sup>73</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion: trends to the next decade</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A new report of SIPRI, published in 2011, states that   weapons imports to South America during the 2005-2006 period rose by 150%   compared to the 2000-2004 period. SIPRI attributes this strong rise to high   prices of commodities, such as soybean, oil, and cooper. The three South   American countries that have bought more weapons during the first decade of the   new millennium were Chile (13<sup>th</sup> in the world ranking), Venezuela (17<sup>th</sup> in the world ranking), and Brazil (30<sup>th</sup> in the global ranking)<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><sup>74</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, despite economic factors being an important   parameter to explain the weapons imports, the information and data presented   and analyzed in this paper suggest several more complex trends about   modernization of the armed forces and South American military build-up in the   first decade of the 2000s:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Almost all South American countries announced large   military plans to modernize and reform its armed forces, necessarily implying   an increase in spending on the medium-term. That suggests military spending   should increase over the next ten years<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><sup>75</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Almost all South American countries have initiated a   recapitalization of its obsolete military stockpile, dated in its majority to   the 1950s to 1960s, being the most modern ones from the 1980s. This   recapitalization aims solely to update and replace old military equipment.   Apart from the cases of Chile and Venezuela, other South American countries   intend to upgrade their equipment, and the purchase of second-hand   transportation units and weaponry seems to be the preferred choice due to   financial constraints. Spending in 2010 was 42% higher in South America than in   2002, and military spending increased significantly in 7 of the 10 South   American countries, including countries relatively less influent in regional   affairs like Paraguay (16%) and Peru (16%), with low military expenditure   through the first decade of the millennium<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><sup>76</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">South American countries with major military   capability (specifically Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela) benefit from   additional mechanisms to increase their military budget beyond the legislative   stipulation for defense expenditures (the Copper Law in Chile, the "Umbrella   Law" in Colombia, etc.). Therefore, the original military budget in each fiscal   year rarely coincides with the real military spending.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is great asymmetry in the level of arms   purchases among South American countries: Chile and Venezuela do not represent   the spending pattern of the region. Beyond that, almost all military institutions   suffer from financial constraints, hence the option for purchasing second-hand   equipment to be credited as the most viable way of funding their modernization   projects.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a strong tendency among the Andean countries   (plus Chile) to use their export commodities (oil, gas, and copper) to finance   military spending and support its plans to modernize the Armed Forces and their   military equipment.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">South American weaponry market is no longer   predominated by the United States. EU countries such as Great Britain, Spain,   Germany, and France configure the main import markets for weapons.

This article aims to investigate the interface between gender, color/race and public health in Brazil, focusing on the importance of reproductive health for the formation of a black feminism in the country, between the years 1975 to 1993. The black feminism was shaped from the relations between black activists and feminist and black rights movements. The topic of reproductive health, under a racial perspective, gained importance in the 1980's from reports of surgical sterilization among black women. The article investigates the context in which such allegations have emerged and their relevance to the formation of an identity among black activists.

Abstract This article discusses some dimensions of my research on suffering demeanor in emotional support services. I focused in another work on the discourses and interaction techniques as crucial aspects of these services, in particular the Centro de Valorização da Vida (CVV), in Rio de Janeiro, and the SOS Voz Amiga, in Lisbon. Here I try to highlight the sources of these moralities, seeking to investigate the foundational elements that shape their moral arrangements. For this, I am particularly interested in speech acts, exploring proximities and resonances between CVV methods and the practices of confession and testimony.

Abstract This work aims to understand certain socio-cultural elements through which the relationships between the two main characters of the French movie The intouchables are built. This fiction enables us to detect certain implicit codes that shape specific subjectivities in the French society. Focusing on how a public sphere intersects with a private one and &#8211; vice versa &#8211; we will see how some processes of assimilation and reproduction of a specific culture are built. At the same time, we aim to demonstrate that this analysis of those hidden intersections might be able to convey some critical and political potentialities.

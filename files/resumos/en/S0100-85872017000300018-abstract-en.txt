Abstract In this article, we propose to point out and reflect on problems and challenges to be faced in the register process of intangible heritage, particularly those of religious nature. We took as case study the results of a research carried out with the Folia de Reis in the Municipality of Valen√ßa (RJ), which also dealt with the process (in progress) of national registration of Folias de Reis Fluminenses (held in Rio de Janeiro State), whose inventory was carried out by Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ), through a Cooperation Term signed with National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN).

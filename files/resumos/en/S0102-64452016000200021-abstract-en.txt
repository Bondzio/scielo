Abstract Zika virus was first isolated in 1947 in Uganda. If the disease has existed since then, why is it only now that there is attention from the media, science, funding agencies and national and international bodies? From the standpoint of critical global health that considers the social, political and ideological contexts which Zika is framed, we aim to analyse the Zika epidemic in four aspects: (1) investigation of the social, cultural and political processes; (2) analysis of signification practices; (3) study of neglected/silenced zones; and (4) attention to the diversity of individual experiences related to health and disease. The political tensions here identified and discussed - related to the control of neglected diseases, social, class and gender determinants - fall into dynamics, which go beyond national borders. In this sense, processes of signification and responses to the epidemic show the current limits of global health.

Abstract: The subject of this article is Axel Honneth&#8217;s theory of recognition. Here it shall be discussed how Honneth have build a new paradigm for his theory and how he has developed it since its original publication in Struggle for recognition, in 1992. These developments, that have lead him to reflect on the concept of reification and on the sociology of work will be discussed in light of the idea of recognition itself, so that it becomes possible to see if they show any fruitful path for the development of this theory.

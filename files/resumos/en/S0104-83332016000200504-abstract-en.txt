Abstract This article reflects on the impacts of the Internet on the relationships between individuals, state agencies and social movements by analyzing the case of a gang rape in the Morro da Bar√£o neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro in May 2016, which had national and international repercussions in the major media and on social networks. To do so, a mapping was conducted of news articles and videos about &#8220;rape culture&#8221; and of comments about this material, which led me to different understandings of the term and to moralities involved with these understandings and questionings of them.

In analysis about political parties, there is a classical debate about types of parties. Typological models are based specially on indicators. Party funding is a central dimension that provides parameters to identify types. In this paper, we propose contrasting different party models highlighted in literature with the profile of funding found in Brazilian party organizations. Through data provided by the Electoral Supreme Court (TSE), we identify the origin of resources that fund parties. We conclude that there is, in case of Brazil, a clear departure from cadre-based parties of and mass parties and an approximation to a catch-all or cartel party. However, the Party Fund has not shown evidence to support the thesis of a process of cartelization. Instead, it has helped to guarantee smaller concentration in political competition and also to keep a larger supply in the party market.

Abstract: This article is a descriptive synthesis of the historical context centered on the discussions about the different positions in the approval of the political rights of women in Uruguay from 1920 to 1938. From women&#8217;s history, this study proposed to report new historical discourses where women and their actions were equitably represented in the history of men. In the process of consolidating Uruguay as a "model country" created under the aegis of Batllism, the political parties were presented as the main instruments, which transmitted the changes according to their specific electoral and political interests. In discussions about the values that characterized Uruguay, the issue of women's political rights was present. The parties have taken women as a political object as one of the axes of this democratic and social consolidation.

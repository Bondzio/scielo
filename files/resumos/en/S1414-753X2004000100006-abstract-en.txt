Since the 70s, environmental movements have discussed the impact of technological advance upon the planet ecosystem. With notions such as environmental impacts and risks in mind, environmental sociology has pointed out many effects of modern technologies on environment, mostly in a technological phobic manner and a defensive way. From the perspective of innovation, this paper aims to debate different positions regarding technology. Instead of focusing on specific technologies and immediate effects, innovation provides a broader and systemic view on technological practices. The building of democratic and decentralized social and technological networks and efficient and multiple innovation environments represent today essential conditions for environmentalism.

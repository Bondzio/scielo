This paper discusses Foucault's concepts of power, subjectification and (a)normality, as well as Homi Bhabha's concepts of culture and difference, in relation to the question of the feminine enunciation as articulated by the psychoanalyst Maria Rita Kehl. The article assesses how discourses on women are constructed in different televised products, emphasizing the symbolic emptiness/silences of the feminine. According to Kehl, for both men and women this fact is a consequence of "the cursed dimension in our culture," since women have been historically in a position in which the subject is always the other: be it the father, the phallic mother or the partner.

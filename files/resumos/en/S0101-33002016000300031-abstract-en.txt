ABSTRACT This article addresses the relationships between architects and the questions of &#8220;the people&#8221; and &#8220;social housing&#8221; as discursive constructions and urban realities in SÃ£o Paulo, from the 1960s until the 1980s. In the 1970s, in the midst of a crisis of initial attempts to situate the problem of low-income housing at the center of architects&#8217; agendas within the political left, the relationship between progressive architects and poor peripheral populations goes through an initial paradigmatic turn.

Abstract The text aims to address the issue of the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in disaster risk management (DRM) models. It is based on the different forms of understanding and representation of time in management models. As a result of the literature review, it is argued that the communication flows in the DRM may have three cognitive characters ICTs: a) multisignified; b) multidirectional and multilevel; c) multidimensional. The literature review, used as the main method to develop this argument, structured the text into four main parts: 1) Disaster management models; 2) Use of ICTs in DRM; 3) Communication flow; 4) Final considerations.

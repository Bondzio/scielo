Abstract: Notes on the research &#8220;Drawing the city&#8221;, which began in March 2012. I begin by mapping the production of an international group calling themselves &#8220;urban sketchers&#8221; whose collective project extols drawing as a form of looking, knowing and registering the experience of living in cities. Next I show the connections between drawing and anthropology, as well as their relation to cities and to Rio de Janeiro in particular. What narratives about the city are produced? What areas, themes and elements are selected, cut, drawn? These are some of the questions that form the starting point for my ethnographic research.

This paper analyses the regulation of technology as a process of power dispute through which the character of neutrality of scientific knowledge is adopted as a legitimising factor of regulating bodies. The dispute for the regulation of genetically modified organisms is taken as a case study from two fundamental principles: the Principle of Substantial Equivalence adopted by the USA; and the Precautionary Principle adopted by European Union Countries.

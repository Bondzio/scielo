A great many misreadings, that is, readings out of context    and more or less "creative misinterpretations," were necessary for    an international success that he never anticipated. But there were also some    inherent qualities of work and person that facilitated the reception especially    in the English-speaking world. His major sociological writings, <I>Economy and    Society</I>, <I>The Economic Ethics of the World Religions</I> and <I>Wissenschaftslehre</I>    are relatively "denationalized." They have, of course, a specifically    German intellectual context, but in contrast to the works of many contemporaries    they lack the special pleading for the superiority of <I>Deutschtum</I> and    the fashionable anti-western <I>Kulturpessimismus</I>. "The Protestant    Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism," in particular, has an important anglophile    dimension, which was connected with his cosmopolitan family background.<a name="sup01"></a><a href="#end01"><SUP>1</SUP></a>    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the historiography of Imperial Germany Weber    has been treated mainly as a liberal imperialist, social imperialist or, in    his own words, an "economic nationalist."<a name="sup02"></a><a href="#end02"><SUP>2</SUP></a>    But if one wants to use labels at all, I prefer to call him a "cosmopolitan    nationalist" because he never wavered in his support of Germany's peaceful    integration into the world economy, even during the First World War. The cosmopolitan    dimension, I suggest, has much to do with his extended family history, which    has been relatively neglected even though it influenced his world view and oeuvre    in significant respects.<a name="sup03"></a><a href="#end03"><SUP>3</SUP></a>    It had a bearing not only on his economic policy views but also on his career    expectations, which were oriented toward commercial law for a longer time than    has been perceived up until now. This reconsideration is facilitated by Knut    Borchardt's recent edition of Weber's writings on the functioning and reform    of securities and commodity exchanges; this part of the oeuvre has been very    much overlooked in the literature.<a name="sup04"></a><a href="#end04"><SUP>4</SUP></a>    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">My purpose, then, is twofold: I will first sketch    the cosmopolitan family context and then turn to Weber's political and scholarly    agenda, especially the little-known story of his strong political and professional    engagement in the battle over exchange reform in the nineteen-nineties. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><B>The cosmopolitan family context</B></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Weber was a scion of the cosmopolitan bourgeoisie    that created the capitalist world economy of the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century. On    both sides he descended from merchant families that were engaged worldwide.    On the maternal side the Frankfurt Souchay clan, based mainly in London and    Manchester, was one of the wealthiest Anglo-German families in the middle of    the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century; on the paternal side the Bielefeld Weber clan gained    international importance especially through its trading and shipping firms in    Hamburg. (The 150-year-old Hamburg firm "Weber &amp; Schaer" is still    one of the most important importers of natural rubber and also a major exporter    of machinery.) Again on the maternal side, there was the Fallenstein linkage    with the Bunge family in Antwerp and South America; the Bunge firms are still    among the richest privately held companies in the world, active in cereal production    and shipping. Within Weber's far-flung family, the opposition but also overlap    of cosmopolitan and nationalist attitudes come into sharp focus. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From early on Weber was familiar with the details    of his family history, including the English and Dutch-Belgian lines. At Christmas    1879, Fritz Baumgarten made "his dear cousin Max Weber" the present    of a Goethe calender, in which the vital dates of many members were listed,    but when he also let Max read the G. F. Fallenstein biography by the famous    historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus, father Weber protested "that I was    so lacking in pedagogical acumen as to let grandfather's biography fall into    little Max's hands - for the big family tree he was busy drawing."<a name="sup05"></a><a href="#end05"><SUP>5</SUP></a>    At any rate Max jun. realized early that his Heidelberg grandmother, Frau Geheime    Finanzrat (Privy Councilor) Emilie Souchay Fallenstein was the daughter of the    Anglo-German business founder Carl Cornelius Souchay; the sister of the Frankfurt    senator and mayor Eduard Souchay und of the two English "patrician merchants"    (<I>Handelsherren</I>) Charles and John Souchay in Manchester; the sister-in-law    of Friedrich Wilhelm Benecke, head of Benecke, Souchay &amp; Co. in London;    and the mother-in-law of the Baden prime minister Julius Jolly, the political    writer and historian Hermann Baumgarten, the politically active theologian and    novelist Adolf Hausrath, the Alsatian geologist Ernst Wilhelm Benecke, the leading    Antwerp businessman Karl Gustav Bunge, as well as of his own father, the Berlin    city councillor in charge of public construction and member of the Reichstag    and Prussian diet. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For a number of reasons, Weber could not realize    his ambition to pursue a "practical" vocation. After finishing dissertation    and <I>Habilitation</I>, he hoped in vain "to learn the practice of the    import/export trade for several years."<a name="sup06"></a><a href="#end06"><SUP>6</SUP></a>    His first academic choice was commercial law, but he chose an academic career    with great ambivalence and abandoned teaching after only seven years in the    wake of his extended illness. Taking the option of living as a capitalist rentier    and gentleman scholar, he could henceforth afford to be "undisciplined"    in both senses of the word: he was free to ignore academic boundary lines and    to indulge in a pattern of "stop and go" scholarship . He made the    most of his unstructured situation and succeeded despite his lingering illness    in composing his cosmopolitan sociology and developmental history - largely    in the Heidelberg family mansion that had been built with profits from world    trade. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The connections between family background, economic    policy views and scholarly writings are partly direct, partly indirect. Some    Marxist writers have singled out Weber as the foremost representative of "bourgeois    sociology," but they have shown only superficial knowledge of the family    history. (Friedrich Engels, partner in a small Manchester firm, reported to    Marx several times on the leading firm of "Schunck, Souchay &amp; Co.,"    the major source of the Weber fortune, but to my knowledge the secondary literature    did not detect the connection.) In a non-polemical essay, published in 1979,    Karl-Siegberg Rehberg interpreted the most abstract <I>Grundbegriffe</I> of    <I>Economy and Society</I> as emanating from "a grand-bourgeois world view";    but this was an internal analysis without reference to the wider family history.<a name="sup07"></a><a href="#end07"><SUP>7</SUP></a>    If we look at the latter, we can recognize that the young Weber's interests    in East Elbian agrarian capitalism and in securities and commodity exchanges    were to a considerable extent a family matter. In the Reichstag, Max Weber senior    fought efforts by the conservatives to raise taxes on financial capital and    impede the capital and commodity markets. In the Prussian diet, he was a member    of the commission that drafted the "homesteading act" of 1886; the    law aimed at reversing the decline of the German population in the East. On    the government's side, executive responsibility for the law rested with the    minister of agriculture, Robert Lucius von Ballhausen, with whom Max sen. often    collaborated over three decades and whose English-born wife Juliet Souchay was    a cousin of his own wife Helene Fallenstein. While Max junior was still synthesizing    the survey on East Elbian agrarian labor in 1892, he suddenly developed expertise    on the Argentinian economy, which appeared as an unexpected insertion in his    1892 article on the survey and a year later in his article on Argentinian colonists.    The source for much of his information was his cousin Julius Fallenstein, who    visited him at the same time. Julius was one of three Fallensteins who worked    in Argentina for Weber's Antwerp cousin Ernest Bunge, who was at the point of    becoming the biggest wheat exporter to Europe. Weber favored raising protective    tariffs but without giving in to the exorbitant self-interested demands of the    East Elbian agrarians. Decades later, in a wartime speech in 1916, he opposed    rightwing demands for Belgian annexations, adding: "Antwerp will always    remain a non-German city. I know it, I have relatives there" (MWG, I/15:177).    Even though he distanced himself in this speech from cosmopolitan family capitalism    in favor of the national interest, he could not resist the temptation to reveal    the family nexus. At the beginning of the war, Eduard Bunge, Weber's other Antwerp    cousin, lost the biggest natural rubber warehouse on the continent. Plundered    by the German army, the stock was put at the disposal of the Imperial commissioner    for caoutchouc (rubber), Albert Weber, co-owner of "Weber &amp; Schaer"    in Hamburg, another relative of Max jun.<a name="sup08"></a><a href="#end08"><SUP>8</SUP></a>    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Weber's interest in the United States was also    rooted in early family experiences. On Christmas 1875 his paternal mentor Friedrich    Kapp, for many years active in Republican politics in New York City, gave the    eleven-year-old a German copy of Benjamin Franklin's autobiography. In the introduction    Kapp advised: "May every German father put Franklin's autobiography into    his son's hands as a textbook&#133; We lag behind the materially more developed    peoples, especially the Americans, in appreciating the proper role of money-making    and material means in achieving spiritual and moral purposes."<a name="sup09"></a><a href="#end09"><SUP>9</SUP></a>    Max also learned from Kapp about the darker sides of American democracy, from    the "predatory wars by the democratic Union against Mexico" (Dec.    6, 1885, Jugendbriefe 192) to the rule of the bosses and machines in the cities.    He did not have to wait for the great works of Hermann von Holst (1873ff.) and    James Bryce (1888) to gain a wider understanding of American History.<a name="sup10"></a><a href="#end10"><SUP>10</SUP></a>    The young Weber's interest in the United States deepened when his father, who    represented private railroad interests in the Prussian parliament, accepted    an invitation by the German-American railroad tycoon Henry Villard (Heinrich    Hilgard) to attend the opening of the transcontinental line of the Northern    Pacific in 1883. Max sen. traveled for a month in Villard's private train with    Georg Siemens, director of the Deutsche Bank, and also met the former Heidelberg    student James Bryce, who later recounted the trip in his classic <I>American    Commonwealth</I>. Villard also financed the travel grants of the Imperial government    to the Chicago World's Fair of 1893, which Max jun. intended to visit (with    Paul G&ouml;hre). Because of the unexpected engagement to Marianne Schnitger    (a second cousin), Weber postponed his trip until the St. Louis World Fair of    1904, when he visited the Villard family in New York.<a name="sup11"></a><a href="#end11"><SUP>11</SUP></a>    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> In the first version of <I>Economy and Society,    </I> Henry Villard appears in the charisma fragment (ES 1118), one of the few    directly visible links between family knowledge and scholarly work: </font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The antagonism between charisma and everyday      life arises also in the capitalist economy, with the difference that charisma      does not confront the household but the enterprise. An instance of grandiose      robber capitalism and of a spoils-oriented following is provided by Henry      Villard's exploits. &#91;In 1881&#93; he organized the famous 'blind pool' in order      to stage a stock exchange raid on the shares of the Northern Pacific Railroad;      he asked the public for a loan of fifty million pounds without revealing his      goal, and received it without security by virtue of his reputation. The structure      and spirit of this robber capitalism differs radically from the rational management      of an ordinary capitalist large-scale enterprise and is most similar to some      age-old phenomena.<a name="sup12"></a><a href="#end12"><SUP>12</SUP></a> </font></p>  </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Weber's judgment may have been influenced by    the Northern Pacific's third bankruptcy in 1893, the second for Villard, when    many German professors again lost much money from their investments in American    railroad stocks. The Webers themselves held American shares until well into    the First World War. At any rate, the young Weber was well informed about the    connection between railroad expansion and wheat exports to Europe. His (later)    friend Max Sering preceded Weber's father in the spring of 1883 as Villard's    guest and wrote a study for the German government on <I>The Agrarian Competition    of North America in the Present and the Future. Agriculture, Colonisation and    Railroad Transport in the United States and British North America</I> (1887).    The railroad official Alfred von der Leyen, a close family friend and Friedrich    Kapp's son-in-law, wrote two studies between 1885 and 1895 about the politics    and economics of American railroad expansion. The rapid growth of the international    grain trade, in which the Bunge branch of the family played a major part, was    directly linked to the political conflict over German grain tariffs and complaints    of the Prussian Junkers about international competition and changes in the agricultural    labor force. This is the context in which Weber turned to the issue of agrarian    capitalism and German and Polish labor in East Elbia. </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><B>The purpose and reform of exchanges: Weber's    political and scholarly agenda</B> </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although the English secondary literature has    given considerable attention to Weber's analyses of agrarian capitalism, his    engagement with the functioning and reform of securities and commodities exchanges    has been relatively neglected.<a name="sup13"></a><a href="#end13"><SUP>13</SUP></a>    On this score too the family dimension has been largely overlooked. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Weber was acutely aware that most of his mother's    "very large fortune" (MWG, II/6: 763), the cause of so much parental    tension, was accumulated on the Manchester cotton exchange and in London merchant    banking; the Hamburg family branch traded on the local exchange. When he became    involved in the debates on the German exchange reform, he took the position    that in principle only persons of means - such as his own relatives - should    trade on the exchange. The London exchange was an exclusive club. The Hamburg    exchange, though open, was embedded in patrician traditions. Both served Weber    as models. In 1896 he did not hesitate to state a plutocratic position to the    commercial and agrarian elite assembled in the governmental exchange commission.    Responding to a leader of the agrarians, he confessed: </font></p>      <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Count Arnim calls the maximum openness of      the exchange the most desirable solution, this conflicts to some degree with      other tendencies in the discussion of the legislation and also with my personal      view which, if you want to put it in unfriendly terms, would bring about a      degree of plutocratic closure of the exchange. I would like to introduce less      a moral test, as the exchange commission and the legislation envisage it,      since it is difficult to achieve, than an economic means test, a proof of      a certain level of wealth. But this is an idea that has no chance given the      prevailing mood in Germany (MWG, I/5: 714).<a name="sup14"></a><a href="#end14"><SUP>14</SUP></a>      </font></p>  </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What were some of the immediate causes that led    to the parliamentary battles over tariffs and the security and commodity exchanges?    A number of bank failures and exchange scandals in the early eighteen nineties    reinforced general anticapitalist sentiments at the same time that agrarian    interests became a formidable pressure group. Beyond the general goal of raising    agricultural (and railroad) tariffs, these interests demanded legislation to    curtail the role of capital and commodity markets, especially the outlawing    of trading in grain futures. In the framework of the great policy debate on    Germany's economic future - <I>Industriestaat</I> or <I>Agrarstaat</I>? - Weber    defended the need for a strong capital market and efficient commodities exchanges    to strengthen the German economy on the world market. (He correctly predicted,    for example, that outlawing trading in grain futures in Berlin would simply    mean that the quotations at the Chicago Board of Trade would set the guidelines.)    Employing a provocative nationalist rhetoric, he turned himself into the foremost    younger expert on the exchange and its reform. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Borchardt has pointed out the "astonishing"    fact that "an author, who in December 1896 faced the commercial elite and    the leaders of the big East Elbian landowners as a leading academic authority    in the Provisional Exchange Commission had not published a single line on this    subject matter until 1894" (MWG, I/5: 91). In the winter semester of 1891/92    Weber acquired in Berlin his <I>Habilitation</I> and therewith the teaching    qualification (<I>venia legendi)</I> for Roman public and private law as well    as commercial law. He immediately took over for the incapacitated Levin Goldschmidt,    his mentor. In the absence of pertinent publications his qualification for commercial    law had been controversial within the faculty, which also did not propose him    for the (associate) professorship for commercial and German law - again an irregular    combination - to which the ministry appointed him in November 1893. Weber taught    courses on "money, banking and exchange," commercial and maritime    law, and agrarian law and history. When government and parliament began to move    toward restricting the exchange, he saw a chance to prove his expertise and    exert some political influence. Similar to the way in which, in 1892, he had    boiled down the huge survey of the Verein f&uuml;r Sozialpolitik to his 800-page    report on "The Conditions of Agricultural Labor in East Elbian Germany,"    he now worked through five thousand pages issued by a government commission    to produce three hundred fifty pages on "The Results of the Inquiry into    the German Exchange" for Goldschmidt's <I>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r das Gesammte    Handelsrecht</I> (1894-96). This was followed and paralleled by articles in    the <I>Handw&ouml;rterbuch der Staatswissenschaften</I> on the proposed reforms    (1895) and in the <I>Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung</I> on the legislation passed    ("The Technical Functions of Trading in Futures," 1896). Together    with some other specialized contributions, they immediately found recognition    among academic experts and government officials. But before Weber could finish    his series analyzing the results of the government inquiry, the Reichstag pushed    through legislation in June 1896 that was based on moralizing sentiments and    vested agrarian interests. The result largely vitiated Weber's purpose. His    quickly acquired reputation seemed to give him a second chance, however, when    he was appointed as one of two academic experts to the "Provisional Exchange    Commission," an advisory body within the Imperial Ministry of the Interior.    There he distinguished himself through a subcommittee report. (For the protocols    with Weber's interventions see MWG, I/5: 673-735). But since he was known to    be opposed to the outlawing of grain futures, the agrarian representatives successfully    prevented his appointment to the permanent board. Weber had anticipated in a    letter to Adolph Wagner (Jan. 1, 1897) that "Count Arnim and his minions    &#91;may see to it&#93; that professors who are alleged to be as friendly to the exchange    as I am will not again be admitted to the Commission" (I/5:105). The agrarians    also tried but failed to push out one of the leading Berlin bankers, Ernst von    Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, about whom Weber reported to Marianne: "As things    have gone until now, I have apparently pleased the millionaire bigwigs. At least    Geheimer Kommerzienrat Mendelssohn Bartholdy always shakes my hand so vigorously    that I am surprised not to have found a check for several hundred thousand Marks    under my writing pad" (I/5: 666, Nov. 22, 1896). With his vigorous handshake,    however, the banker acknowledged not only a young political ally but also a    distant relative. Weber's mother was a cousin of Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy's    wife, whose daughter Maria in turn married Victor Benecke in London, head of    "Benecke, Souchay &amp; Co." in which Helene Weber's fortune was invested    until the eighteen eighties.<a name="sup15"></a><a href="#end15"><SUP>15</SUP></a>    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Weber's move to the economics chair in Freiburg    in 1894 has usually been understood as a turning away from jurisprudence.<a name="sup16"></a><a href="#end16"><SUP>16</SUP></a>    It is true that he had to take on the burden of standard courses in theoretical    and practical economics and in finance. But his major publications at Freiburg    concerned exchange matters. Moreover, he continued to lecture in the law faculty    on "money, banks and exchange"and on the history of German law. Therefore,    Borchardt raises doubt about "the thesis that Weber became an economist    (at the latest) in Freiburg" (I/5: 103). It seems to him that Weber wanted    to keep open a choice between law and economics longer than has been generally    thought - and the option of a possible return to Berlin. The real turning point    came after the move to Heidelberg in the spring of 1897, when his existential    crisis was quickly building. His strenuous political and scholarly activities    for agricultural and commercial reforms in the national interest had come to    naught. In 1899 he condemned for a last time the outlawing of grain futures    and also resigned from the Pan-German League because of its failure to oppose    the big Prussian landowners on the issue of Polish migrant labor. By that time    he had also decided against a run for the Reichstag as a National Liberal, holding    the party responsible for the moralistic exchange legislation. Weber came to    feel that he was totally stymied in politics. At the same time the dramatic    conflict with his father, who died shortly thereafter in the summer of 1897,    became the last step in a sequence of mounting inner tensions that precipitated    his illness and ended his political and academic ambitions. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thereafter Weber was free as a private scholar    to pursue a sweeping historical vision that somewhat paradoxically became important    to the narrower disciplinary articulation and differentiation of American sociology.    His developmental history of rationalism and capitalism turned out to be especially    influential. But he did not basically change his economic policy views. As a    "rather pure bourgeois" he continued to uphold the imperatives of    the capitalist market economy against the right and the left. Although he criticized    the older generation for its dogmatic adherence to laissez-faire doctrines,    he defended even during the First World War "the so-called anarchy of production,    that is, the competition of entrepreneurs with one another" (MWG, I/15:    613). In the latter stages of the war, when the anticapitalist and antidemocratic    right publicly attacked international capital and "Jewish-led democracy"    as the true culprits for the war, he declared: "Before the war we were    told that the country has too much capital and industry. That is the outlook    of na&iuml;ve (<I>weltfremde</I>) intellectuals&#133;. Let us stop the railing    against capital and bourgeoisie (<I>B&uuml;rgertum</I>)! We don't have too much    but too little capital and too few big entrepreneurs"(MWG, I/15: 668).    As late as 1917 Weber warned that Germany might not be able to regain its economic    position on the world market "even if the war ends brilliantly" (I/15:    212). He worried that the spirit of capitalism would lose out to the spirit    of the rentier and was concerned about the impact of the veterans' claims and    the middle-class expections of steady returns on their warbonds. "The ideal    of the safe rent rises up before an increasing part of the nation, and the stupid    outcries of the literati against capitalism pave the way. The decisive problem    of the future is how we can rid ourselves of this spirit of rentiership"    (MWG, I/15: 212). After a peace treaty Weber expected a return to formally peaceful    competition in the world economy.<a name="sup17"></a><a href="#end17"><SUP>17</SUP></a>    In this crucial respect he differed from virulent Social Darwinist nationalism    and Prussian militarism, which treated the use of force not as ultima ratio    but as a normal state of affairs. Weber warned of continuing the practices of    the war economy into the postwar period and opposed projects for nationalization    and establishing an interventionist <I>Wirtschaftsstaat </I>(a once popular    term forgotten today). In significant respects he remained a liberal critic    of the emerging welfare state and its pendant, the militarized state-run economy.    In general, the thrust of his rhetoric and polemic was "anti-anti-capitalist,"    an attitude of opposition that he also adopted toward the fashionable critics    of modernity, whose anti-Semitism, anti-Americanism and Anglophobia he bitterly    opposed. Weber's early death in 1920 spared him from experiencing the failure    to restore a viable world economy and facing the triumph of the fascist and    communist command economies. In his spirit a close colleague, Arthur Salz, and    a relative, Albrecht Mendelssohn Bartholdy - both scholarly and political allies    - persisted in defending the historical and theoretical rationale for capitalism    and the world economy, but lost the battle and ended their lives as exiles in    Columbus (Ohio) and in Oxford (England).<a name="sup18"></a><a href="#end18"><SUP>18</SUP></a></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> If Weber's nationalism is notorious, his cosmopolitanism    warrants remembering. His "cosmopolitan nationalism" presupposed the    capitalist world economy: the "economic community of the nations"    (MWG, I/4: 560) or the "economic community of the world" (I/5:155)    was a basic reality. Weber's economic policies remain of exemplary interest    insofar as they link the presumptive, if contested, national interest with an    unsentimental acceptance of the world economy. His descent from international    trading families provided the ambiance in which he articulated a national economic    policy open to the world-market and opposed to autarky. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It took more than half a century for the world    economy to recover from the two world wars.

He gives proper attention to Weber's teacher Levin Goldschmidt, one of the founders    of the academic field of commercial law. Goldschmidt, author of a famous <I>Universalgeschichte    des Handelsrechts</I>, traced the rise of commercial law out of the practices    of merchants who were mainly Italian. He tried to preserve the "law of    merchants for merchants" as long as possible against the increasing invention    of the state - a view that influenced Weber's judgment.

See <I>Theory and Society</I>, 29 (June 2000):    Steven Lestition, "Historical Preface," 289-304; Weber "Stock    and Commodity Exchanges &#91;Die B&ouml;rse&#93;," 305-338; Weber, "Commerce    on the Stock and Commodity Exchanges &#91;Der B&ouml;rsenverkehr&#93;," 339-371;    Richard Swedberg, "Afterword: The Role of the Market in Max Weber's Work,"    373-384. The translation has many errors, which at crucial points reverse the    meaning of many sentences. For instance, the translation reverses Weber's key    argument that regulating the exchange should be left as far as possible to exchange    traders themselves. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="end05"></a><a href="#sup05">5</a> Marianne    Weber, <I>Max Weber</I>, 51. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="end06"></a><a href="#sup06">6</a> Letter    of Jan. 3, 1891 to Hermann Baumgarten, <I>Jugendbriefe</I> (T&uuml;bingen: Mohr,    1936), 326. </font></p>      <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="end07"></a><a href="#sup07">7</a> Karl-Siegbert    Rehberg, "Rationales Handeln als grossb&uuml;rgerliches Aktionsmodell,"    <I>K&ouml;lner Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie</I>, v.    31, n. 2, p.199-236, 1979.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&#160;<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="javascript: window.open('/scielo.php?script=sci_nlinks&ref=000060&pid=S0102-6992200200010000500004&lng=pt','','width=640,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=1,menubar=yes,');">Links</a>&#160;]<!-- end-ref --> </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="end08"></a><a href="#sup08">8</a> Sometimes    Weber referred to relatives as cousins that were one or two steps removed. This    made it easier for him to remind an audience of his family connections. Thus,    when he opposed the close cooperation of government and big business cartels    at the meetings of the Verein f&uuml;r Sozialpolitik in 1905, he mentioned his    "esteemed cousin &#91;Theodor&#93; M&ouml;ller" (MWG, I/8: 273), the Prussian    minister of trade, who was just at the point of moving his aniline factories    to England under pressure from the Kirdorf cartel, which denied him access to    his coal supplies. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="end09"></a><a href="#sup09">9</a> See    Friedrich Kapp, "Benjamin Franklin," reprinted in <I>Aus und &uuml;ber    Amerika</I> (Berlin: Springer, 1876), 89 and 46.

A. Seligman,    son of the German-born banker and co-founder of the Society for Ethical Culture,    Joseph Seligman. Edwin Seligmann and Weber corresponded as early as 1897; see    Weber's letter, dictated to Marianne, of March 22, 1897 (Columbia U. Libraries,    Special Collections). Marianne also never mentioned Max sen.'s America trip    and eliminated a reference to it in the son's <I>Jugendbriefe</I> (1936). In    line with her own interests, she recalled meeting Florence Kelley in New York    and Jane Addams in Chicago. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="end12"></a><a href="#sup12">12</a> The    facts, which Weber no longer remembered correctly, do not make Villard's 'blind    pool' a convincing example of entrepreneurial charisma. The dichotomy of modern    bureaucratized capitalism (<I>Alltagskapitalismus</I>) and grandiose booty capitalism    makes it hard to recognize that Villard's railroad firm was a rational and efficiently    organized enterprise that still could not be profitable&#151;no English or American    railroad company ever was in the long run. It is intriguing to notice that the    event stayed magnified in Weber's mind and that he exaggerated the number. Only    eight million dollars were raised 'blindly'; fifty million dollars (not pounds)    was the final pool. Investors did not act irrationally. Villard's Oregon Railroad    and Navigation Company paid good dividends and the purpose of his "blind    pool" could be guessed.

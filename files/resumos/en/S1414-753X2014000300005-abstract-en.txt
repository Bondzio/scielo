The areas occupied by cocoa crops shaded with native species (cabruca) have an important environmental role. However, studies show that the diversity of native tree species in these areas has been gradually diminishing. The aim of this study is to identify the perceptions and preferences of farmers with regard to tree species, which provide shading in cabruca areas and how these local species are employed and managed. The species most preferred by farmers were mainly native timber species with high economic value, followed by fruit species, which were mainly exotic. These species have stood out among the dominant species in cabrucas in the region, as shown by a survey of species carried out in 2008. This is mainly due to the shade management adopted by farmers who tend to favour the cultivation and natural regeneration of preferred species in detriment of less popular species.

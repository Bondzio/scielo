Selfies are digital self-portraits produced with support on smartphones and aimed at being published in social networks. Such snapshots are not a private product for private use. In fact, they constitute a new way of self-expression and presentation of oneself for those who take part in the social networks. Furthermore, they are a new and effective way of communication and interaction among individuals through images of themselves, what is made possible by the mobile devices&#8217; technological capabilities. Because of all these features, selfies should be regarded as social photographs. By the same token, the abundant production and the wide-spreading of social photos reveal such practices as capable of highlighting the contours of a regime of subjectivation which is typical of the regular participants of social networks nowadays.

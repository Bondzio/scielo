This paper analyzes the economic profitability of native-tree reforestation for the production of sawlogs. The projects evaluated are experimental rather than commercial and are located in the Brazilian state of SÃ£o Paulo. These experimental plots were reforested with the native tree species Centrolobium tomentosum ("araruva"), Balforodendron riedelianum ("pau-marfim") and Araucaria angustifolia ("pinheiro-brasileiro"), recommended for their economic value by a previous evaluation of long-term native-tree reforestation. Economic profitability analyses were made under both deterministic and risk conditions using data from the reforestation experiments. It was found that all the experiments would be profitable. This paper concludes with the suggestion that new research needs to be conducted to improve the genetic material used for reforestation, as superior stock would increase productivity and promote consistent economic profitability.

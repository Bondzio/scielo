Abstract This paper regards an ethnography realized in the Brazilian southeast state of Esp√≠rito Santo and describes the transversality of spiritual and social relations among quilombos remaining communities. It highlights the concept of &#8220;spiritual chain&#8221;, a conjunctive force that acts amid persons and invisible entities. By a ritual calendar that organizes mutual visits and that must be followed by religious fraternities known as &#8220;bate-flecha&#8221;, the spiritual chain sews the communities and reinforces a series of obligations and powers that flows through it.

Abstract In this article I retrace some paths and disputes faced by feminists in negotiating the introduction of a gender perspective in development issues, with a focus on UN conferences as well as on the more recent critiques to the inclusion of gender in the Beijing + (5, 10, 15 and 20) meetings. I seek to retrace, in particular, Brazil&#8217;s participation in these disputes and the setbacks in our international policies in this field since the 2016 coup.

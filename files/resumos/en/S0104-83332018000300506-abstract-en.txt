Abstract This article investigates the media trajectory of Patrícia Galvão (1910-1962), who became known as Pagu. It examines the time she became known at the heart of the Brazilian modernist movement and two later phases &#8211; as a political prisoner who was tortured and as a journalist and cultural critic. We analyze newspapers and magazines, biographies and academic studies and discuss meanings of Pagu&#8217;s image. She performed countless artistic, political and cultural activities, giving space to an inconsistency that composed permanent fragments of herself capable of multiple combinations. We suggest some hypotheses for the erasure and resurgence of Pagu in the Brazilian imaginary.

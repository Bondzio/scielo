Abstract: This paper focuses on the life chances and consumer orientation of the chinese middle class by examining their characteristics and participation in consumption practices. Data comes from the China General Social Survey 2003. Due to significant economic disparities among regions, this paper draws attention to the division between the migrants and the natives in metropolitan cities, where there are more middle class positions and consumer culture more flourishes. The finding is that the differences between the metropolitan migrants and the metropolitan natives are insignificant in social status attainment and participation in consumption practices. It might be implied that the metropolitan migrants are motivated to achieve higher social class or income and their tastes and lifestyles are influenced by metropolitan cities after migration. Although frugality remains a distinguishing feature of the urban Chinese population, the middle class, the young people and the high-income groups display a more significant orientation to personal pleasure and comfort.

In this paper we establish a comparison by gender between the progress achieved in the different educational levels and the persistent gap in the degree of labour participation in Mexico, during 2000 and 2005. Likewise, we analyze the regional differences in the evolution of the following indicators: the average years of schooling, and the working population. By means of an econometric model of panel data for 32 Mexican regions, we are able to establish that education exert a positive impact on the working population.

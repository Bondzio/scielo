Study about the Baixe e Use project, from TV Câmara, which intends to analyze how the production, use, dissemination and feedback of cultural and educational audiovisual contents occur between a legislative public broadcaster and a segment of society, the school and academic community. Can the appropriation of television products give rise to a new public, beyond the conventional concept of audience? How can this kind of initiative enable the social inclusion of cultural and educational content? How can a public broadcaster with focus on political and legislative content contribute to offer cultural contents to civic life? Those are the main issues discussed from the data collected. The methodology includes bibliographic and documental research and content analysis. Data are compiled using Google Analytics tools and the "Fale Conosco" system ("Contact us") from the TV Câmara website. The conclusion points to the possible interfaces between TV and school, politics and education, storytelling and technology. Moreover, we highlight the peripheral place that the bank contents of Baixe e Use occupies in the general scenario of the station's TV programming, which focuses on institutional promotion scope on legislative and parliamentary activities.

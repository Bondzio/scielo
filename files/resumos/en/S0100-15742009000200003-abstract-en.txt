The article focuses on the internationalization process that has been characterizing curriculum studies nowadays. This moment follows the reconceptualization of the field, which changed its instrumental feature into an effort of understanding curriculum. After presenting some evidences of how the internationalization process has been developed, the text discusses, drawing on the categories of hybridization, cosmopolitism and tradition, how the complicated conversation that marks the present field can contribute to deepen and democratize curriculum knowledge, as well as to stimulate movements towards homogenization, that ends up by suffocating local traditions and interests. Possibilities and risks implicated in the process have, therefore, to be carefully considered.

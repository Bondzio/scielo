Abstract: The article starts with a discussion of the concept of social freedom and distinguishes the three criteria of freedom, welfare and solidarity, of which the last one proves paramount to the realization of freedom as both reciprocally beneficial and mutually binding. After discussing social pathologies induced by capitalist markets, the article proposes a distinction between external and internal forms of eticisation of the market, showing the advantages of the latter, in which Hegel's corporations and Honneth's associations play central roles. Yet, given the weaknesses of associations in the capitalist market, the article concludes by pleading for a constitutive transformation of the market, through a discussion of the right of inheritance and its effects on the property in the means of production.

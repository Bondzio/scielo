Abstract The history of transnational solidarities is fairly recent. It is intimately linked to the convergence of European societies at the beginning of the 19th century and to the emergence of an international system. Solidarity then becomes a social reality and not just a moral value. Its transnationalisation - which faces challenges in terms of definition - occurs under specific political circumstances. Studying international solidarities from a social and historical perspective is therefore doubly informative for internationalists. It captures social phenomena which present themselves as both markers and factors of change in contemporary international relations.

This article investigates the structure of social networks not attached to the                territory: these are interactions mediated by the worldwide computer network that can                structure (predominantly) secondary and (occasionally) primary sociabilities.                Similarly to other structures of territorially based sociability practices, these                based on the Internet can also mobilize resources and provide social support. Based                on Simmel's concept of Social Circles, and resorting to information published in some                specialized journals on mental health, I try to build a typology of sociability                practices mediated by the Internet. It was found that online communities                characterized as mental health social circles constitute relevant instruments for                establishing social support networks and disseminating information and practices                involving care.

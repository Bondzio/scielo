Abstract: The article discusses the relations between sociology and the social issues, exploring the cultural dimension of science in the organization of society in the modern age, in which sociology is at once the resulting effect and the producer of this order. The text is divided into three parts: the first examines the invention of the social property and the role of social protection by the State. The second contrasts the homo sociologicus and the homo &#338;conomicus. The impoverishment appears as the empirical phenomenon against which the critique of utilitarianism is mounted. The third presents three theses on poverty in capitalist society (Tocqueville, Marx &amp; Engels, and Simmel). To conclude this article presents three contemporary paradigms: that of the contract; the second based on the law, and the third based on the theory of gift exchange trying to redefine social protection from the perspective of a unconditional right to a universal basic income to all citizens.

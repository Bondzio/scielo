Abstract Brazilian democratic consolidation has entailed the ratification of human rights treaties, at the same time as the Constitution and legislation incorporate the international debate. Nevertheless, there are constant violations in Brazil. The purpose of this research is to investigate the content of decisions and the use of international instruments in the state and federal courts of three Brazilian regions. As the theoretical references, we discuss the concept of compliance. Our research questions are: the legislative production after the Federal Constitution of 1988 would have resulted in an almost complete conformity with the international instruments, rendering innocuous its use? Would there be a reproduction, by the intermediary courts, of theses and understandings of the superior courts, responsible for the little variety of matters found?

The present paper aims to review a hypothesis from the social movements' perspective within the frame of collective action problematic. This hypothesis considers that the contact between state's initiatives and social movements could be translated in cooptation, bureaucratization or colonization of social movements. The central argument maintains that the principal problem of social movements in current Latin America lies in the type of relation between social movements and the political party in government. This shift is produced in a political context in which stateÂ´s initiatives at the beginning of the third millennium are being oriented to repair precedent social situations, expressed as political and social disintegration problems.

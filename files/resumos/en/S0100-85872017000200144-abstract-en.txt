Abstract Since the 80s, we can identify a progressive recognition of spirituality as a health issue. Medical scientists have engaged in that theme, the WHO included the thematic in its documents, and health policies have mentioned the spirituality as a permanent dimension of care. These formulations have legitimized the idea: &#8220;spirituality is health&#8221;. Is this process also a new way to institutionalize the relationship between state and religion? To reflect about these questions, I analyze therapeutic practices aimed at spirituality on the oncology clinic where different therapists apply reiki. This article presents reflections about the way in which the idea of &#8203;&#8203;spirituality, in healthcare settings, have configured a special set for the religion in the public space.

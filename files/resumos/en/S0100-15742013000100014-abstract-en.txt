The article compares sex education as it is taught in two schools, one in Novo Hamburgo (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) and the other in Santiago de Cuba (Cuba). It is based upon the theoretical assumptions of cultural studies and other recent studies on sex education. The qualitative analysis relied on interviews with both schools principals and teachers, of which the results are here presented.

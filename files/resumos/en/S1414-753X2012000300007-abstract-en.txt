Despite the dissemination of private regulatory mechanisms, the understanding of the motivation and the results of their adoption. is far from consolidated. Few studies have observed the process of implementation and the effectiveness of such mechanisms in producing public goods, especially in developing countries. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the rationale for adoption and the concrete results of private regulatory mechanisms in producing public goods. The case of the alpha-bisabolol (a substance extracted from the Brazilian Candeia tree - Eremanthus erythropappus) value chain has been analyzed through interviews, field visits and a literature review. Among the main conclusions of this work, which focused primarily on the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) are (1) the importance of corporate values, the inflexibility of public policy and public controversy stimulating the adoption of certification and (2) the evidence, at least for this case, that the FSC can be considered effective in its work for the improvement of environmental standards.

In 2008, aviation activity was included in European Union Emissions Trade Scheme (EU ETS), imposing legal obligations to airlines around the world, not just the European Union. Considering these scenario, the aim of the article is to reflect on the admissibility of the unilateral imposition of obligations justified on environmental considerations. In this context, it is important to study the legal battle waged by North American airlines in relation to the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS. The outline of the approach through a case study is justified because it allows reviews of the reflections of the specific dispute in international relations. It is observed that the reluctance of airlines and other states strengthens the understanding of leadership of the European Union on the issue of climate change.

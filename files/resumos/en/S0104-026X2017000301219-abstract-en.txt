Abstract: One of the axes in feminist theoretical debate of the 1960s and 1970s was the relationship between bourgeois domination and male domination. But in much of nowadays discussions, at least those with greater visibility, the issue has been little explored. The emergence of black, indigenous and transgender feminisms leads to the recognition of the diversity in women's condition, but &#8220;class&#8221; is a category that is not incorporated - or is incorporated very marginally - to the debate. The article analyzes the reasons and consequences of this oblivion, revisiting the contributions of authors like Christine Delphy, Zillah Eisenstein, Heidi Hartmann, and Iris Marion Young. Although none of them has produced an entirely convincing model of the mutual relationship between capitalism and male domination, they advanced the understanding of critical processes.

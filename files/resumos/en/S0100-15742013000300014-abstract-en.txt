This article presents the results of a case study on educational innovation concerning the involvement of a Non Governmental Organization with young people in the outskirts of Manaus and in extractive communities of Boa Vista do Ramos, in the state of Amazonas. The hypothesis examined in the survey was that salient factors that combine to generate innovative actions are the educators' time of professional experience, their staff's stability, and the level of qualification and mobilizing actions of the organization's leaders. The organization's objectives and mode of operation are described and the leaders', agents' and staff's characteristics are identified. Results showed that the hypothesis was partially confirmed.

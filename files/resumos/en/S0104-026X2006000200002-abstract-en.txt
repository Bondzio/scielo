On this paper we discuss, within the cross over of two representations - woman and politic function - the media's power to influence voters' choices and their roles as interpreters of media messages. Under a position that understands the relativity of the media's power, we set the idea of gender discourse as a mediator of its influence. Whereas literature shows how a candidate suffers an important effect of media exposition, transformed in a marketing product, we suggest that women in politics suffer from the stereotype that states "women's place is at home". We conclude that women politic participation is strongly linked to the way in which they are represented in the common sense and a change in the hegemonic discourses about women that cross individuals and social groups becomes necessary as to have this situation modified.

This paper is the product of a research program in the State of California (USA), which aims it to analyze the main characteristics of the educational financing in that State. California has 33 million inhabitants and some 6 million primary students attending school from kindergarten - 5-years olds - through 12th grade. The major challenge faced by the State - mainly due to court decisions - is ensuring a minimum level of financial resources per student and avoiding discrepancy in spending per student between poor and rich districts. This second objective has been partially attained by lowering the level of State spending, so that California is, nowadays, the 40th in the American ranking of spending per student.

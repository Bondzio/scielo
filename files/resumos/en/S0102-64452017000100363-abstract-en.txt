Abstract This paper aims at investigating the political vocabulary of the Milesian thought, that is, the intellectual movement composed by Thales, Anaximander and Anaximenes and developed in the special circumstances of sixth-century BC Ionia. In the context of archaic polis, these thinkers presented a philosophy of nature that established the basis of a concrete philosophical and political rationality, which was manifested in a conceptual language and expressed the singular experience of the ancient Greek city and the conditions of its social and mutable evolution, in dialogue and tension with the traditional mythology and anthropomorphic religion.

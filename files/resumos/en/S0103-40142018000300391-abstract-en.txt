ABSTRACT This article aims to discuss the &#8220;decolonial&#8221; perspective of Aníbal Quijano (1930-2018) and its uses after José Carlos Mariátegui. Firstly, we relate the Latin American historical context since the 1980s to Marítegui&#8217;s interpretation of Aníbal Quijano&#8217;s work, based mainly on the formulation of a foundational theory (philosophical, epistemological, ethical and political) on the specificity of Latin America. Quijano then rediscovers a certain Mariátegui associated with the critical renovation of Latin American social theory. Through multiple mechanisms of dissemination, he establishes an well-acknowledged philosophical and epistemological characterization of Mariátegui&#8217;s arsenal, seen as the bastion of Eurocentric criticism (&#8220;alternative rationality&#8221;), in order to legitimize it as a fundamental reference of the &#8220;coloniality of power&#8221; theory.

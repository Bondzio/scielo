Abstract This text suggests that social movements can be understood as formulators of &#8216;political theory&#8217; according to a specific and critical definition of what the political-theoretical vocation would be. Inspired by the so-called ideational turn, and bringing together two separate discussions in the literature (namely the debates between political theory and public policy), this study analyzes the impact of the idea of &#8216;gender&#8217; on two policies in the Paraguayan case. We argue that the conception of political theory as a public criticism to a systematic bias considered unfair is adequate to the understanding of social movements not only as ideas carriers, but also as &#8216;authors in action&#8217; or &#8216;collective political theorists&#8217;.

Abstract:The objective of the research was to analyze the distribution of the credit use between the rural establishments, considering, as criteria, the number of establishments and participating in production value. To analyze this distribution, the percentage of credit used by the 50% lower and by the 5 and 10% larger establishments, the average value financed and the concentration index were calculated. The results showed that the distribution of funding between the agricultural establishments are concentrated, but tends to reflect the differences of these establishments with respect their contribution to the production value. This result is related to the effects of Pronaf, a program that benefits the establishments of the lower strata of area. In the absence of this program, the distribution of the government programs of credit would be much more concentrated. However, changes in the operational rules of this program, which favor more capitalized farmers and regions where they predominate, are probably reducing this effect.

An innovative methodology in the Paraguayan context was implemented to train rural extensionists in the Department of Caazap√°. It aimed at the empowerment and the transformation of rural extension practices, looking for a more horizontal and participatory model of interaction. In order to reach these objectives, eight monthly training modules were implemented, in which reflexive processes about the problems faced by rural extensionists in their practice and spaces aimed at the construction of proposals to overcome them were implemented. In this article, the implementation, as well as the impact of the training process in the rural extensionists' beliefs, are described and evaluated at a qualitative and a quantitative level. Evidence shows that the implemented methodology significantly transformed the way in which practitioners perceive their role in the context of extension work. Now, they conceive themselves as facilitators that have to work jointly with farmers, instead of those who have to bring them all the solutions.

This work pretends to analyze the socialist strategies for the production of a modern citizenship, during the socialism foundational period (1896-1910), coincident with the moment of basic scholarship in Argentine. The investigations about those socialists debates line a special interest for the gender problems because the socialism is one of the political formations that in Argentine strongly defended the feminine emancipation and very early impelled the production of a modern citizenship for both sexes.

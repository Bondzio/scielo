Abstract This article studies the influence of religious affiliation on the opinion of voters and their representatives in Brazilian National Congress, compares the opinion of voters classified according to their religion and analyzes the opinion of congressmen and those belonging to the so-called Bancada Evangélica (Evangelical Bench), made up of non-Pentecostal Evangelical and Pentecostal Evangelical congressmen. It also shows that religion influences little the opinion of voters and congressmen in the themes of economic and structural nature, and influences more the opinion on issues of morality and behavior. Demonstrates that the Bancada Evangélica moves itself sometimes in the direction of their voters, some other times in the directions of the Congress as a whole, distinguishing itself as a group especially concerned with sexual morality.

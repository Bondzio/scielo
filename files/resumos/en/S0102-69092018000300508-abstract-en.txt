This study looks into the participation of unionist parliamentarians in the decision making process for the establishment of the Fundação de Previdência Complementar do Servidor Público Federal, during the first mandate of the Dilma Rousseff government. We formulated the research problem in the following manner: in a political institutional context in which the unionist bloc is part of the government coalition, how do unionist parliamentarians position themselves in law propositions that negatively affect the interests of important parts of their social representative base? The research findings reinforce the thesis of partisan preponderance in the Brazilian decision-making process. The majority of unionist parliamentarians, including those originally from the public sector, defended and voted favorably for passing the Bill 1992/2007, which established the Funpresp. This was the case even under strong opposition from federal public servants from the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches.

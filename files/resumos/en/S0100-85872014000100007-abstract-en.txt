This paper turns towards a religious movement known as the Sunrise Valley, which appears in late 1960 in Brasilia and is marked by an intense religious syncretism, incorporating elements of Catholicism, spiritism, african-Brazilian religions and New Age. The adherents of this movement are recognized as mediums, with two distinct types: the Apar√°, which incorporates the spiritual entities, and the Doutrinador, that not incorporates but commands the rituals, our analysis is about the first type, more specifically on the relationship between his body and the religious belonging, based on the data obtained through ethnographic research, especially during a ritual called &#34;Trono&#34;.

Abstract: These notes integrate a larger scope job on the experience gender identity configurations in the so called the twentieth century &#8220;plumb&#8221; days in the in Brazil. Clarice Lispector&#8217;s weekly writings in Jornal do Brasil, from the mid-1960&#8217;s to the early-1970&#8217;s shed light upon subjectivity processes under way against a setting of brutal political repression by the totalitarian state then. Her pen trespasses the slight frontiers between fiction and nonfiction, in pursuit of the emergence of the uncanny (Sigmund FREUD, 1976), a basic gender element to literary dynamics.

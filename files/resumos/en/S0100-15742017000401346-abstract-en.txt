ABSTRACT This text is based on a study that aimed to analyze the theoretical-methodological framework proposed by the research group of the department of Investigaciones Educativas do Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional - DIE-Cinvestav-IPN - of Mexico, and its use by researchers of graduate programs in Brazil and Argentina, since the 1980s. It is justified by the high acceptance of the DIE proposal in Latin America, particularly in the countries mentioned above. It can offer another possible interpretation of the school in its everyday dynamics and in its relationship with society, as opposed to studies guided by the &#8220;theories of reproduction&#8221;. It is a study in comparative perspective, of documentary type, which sought to define the state of knowledge in educational research in its interface with history and anthropology in Brazil and in Argentina.

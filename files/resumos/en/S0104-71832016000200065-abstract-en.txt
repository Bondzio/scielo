Abstract This article aims to put in evidence the narrative conventions that are the official documents produced by the Bureau of Women&#8217;s Defense of Campinas, in cases of rape and lewd acts, between 2004 and 2005. Taking into account, the &#8220;grammar&#8221; and &#8220;lexicons&#8221; produced by the civil police, I would like to reflect on the narratives inflections that are put in place by this corporation when police clerk and police chief, through its routine work of writing, forge terms, produce threads narrative, sequences and textual images. Taking as a backdrop the spatiality, the sounds and silences imposed on expedients work of this police office, I seek also to highlight the expertise, strategies and tactics deployed by police clerk and police before the daily dilemmas of listening/written faced.

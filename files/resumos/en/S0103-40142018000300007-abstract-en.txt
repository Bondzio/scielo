ABSTRACT The teaching of Botany is inserted in the broader context of Biological Education. However, it presents some peculiarities that justify a careful and specific analysis of its issues. We reflect on the objectives, challenges and possibilities of focusing on this central theme in Basic Education. We discuss the importance of contextualization to promote quality teaching in Botany, especially when allied with the use of a variety of dynamic didactic strategies conducive to student interest and proaction. Finally, we emphasize the relevance of bringing together University and School, reporting some experiences related to this perspective.

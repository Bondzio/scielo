The field of feminist and gender studies has advanced while becoming linked with other categories of analysis, such as generation, class, race/ethnic groups, sexual orientation, region and religion. However, one issue still remains isolated from the effort of intersecting those categories, namely disability. Therefore, here we have sought to evaluate some of the possibilities to the analysis of social and cultural phenomena in which the dialog between feminist and gender studies and the field of disability studies is considered to be appropriate. It is expected that greater visibility will be provided to the debate on such issue by evaluating its analytical and political potential in view of its contribution to public policies.

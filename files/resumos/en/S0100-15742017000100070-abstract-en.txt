Abstract The article discusses the path of the five women scientists who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, between 1947 and 1988, regarded as pioneers in this area in the course of this award created in 1901. In a perspective marked by advances in feminist criticism of science, in the fields of gender and science and the history of science, this article summarizes various aspects linked to the origins and education of these women, focusing on gender interference in the construction of their careers. The discussion aims to contribute to the debate about feminization. Several sources have been consulted, including the award site with their autobiographies as well as their speeches and lectures during the award ceremonies.

Abstract: This text discusses the specificities of Latin American sociology of work vis-Ã -vis the European and North American disciplines, analyzing its themes and its theoretical and methodological approaches. On the one hand, it debates the different phases the discipline went through because of the changing social reality. It supports that even though the Latin American sociology of work has been inspired on the themes and problems discussed by the European and North American sociology, it has always maintained its specificities. On the other hand, it drives the attention to the new questions that are being faced by the region because of the deep process of economic and social transformation in course and its implications to the sociology of work. The focus in this part is on the Mercosul countries.

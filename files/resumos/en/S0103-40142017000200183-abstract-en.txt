ABSTRACT Mário de Andrade&#8217;s marginalia on Brazilian Romantic poetry represent some of his key projects: Dicionário musical, Zoofonia, Na pancada do ganzá, Gramatiquinha da fala brasileira, O sequestro da dona ausente. The purpose here is to articulate his marginal notes, informative as they are about such projects, with his psychological conception of poetry, which allows him to embrace Romantic lyricism as an authentic expression, even if problematic, of the Brazilian matter.

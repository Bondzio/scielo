Abstract: This article seeks to address the economy of desire in its intimate ties with race relations that mark the male hustler saunas in SÃ£o Paulo. After describing certain characteristics of an ethnography of hustler saunas and inquiring into their specificities, the text goes on to analyze the double insertion of the black body (as object of desire and, simultaneously, as object of disgust) in these spaces, as well as inquiry concerning the category "moreno". The article concludes by suggesting that saunas present a racialized desire.

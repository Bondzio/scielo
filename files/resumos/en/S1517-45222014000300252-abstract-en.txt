During the early &#180;90s, the Menemism managed to build in Argentina a new cultural                hegemony around neoliberal values. This paper examines some key aspects of this                successful hegemonic construction, placing the shaft in the discursive dimension of                the phenomenon. From an original theoretical-methodological approach, which analyzes                the dialectical relationship between the verbal plane of presidential discourse and                the extra-linguistics conditions of possibility, provides elements to elucidate the                interpellative effectiveness of the Menemist hegemony to transform existing                identities and build a new political and social order and new successful common                sense.

This article aims to discuss the theoretical frames that supports biodiversity conservation policy in Brazil: the paradigm of biodiversity isles surrounded by areas altered by predatory human action and the paradigm of regional biodiversity, which foresees the creation and maintenance of a network of protected areas integrated to their regional context and different perspectives of social dynamics within and in the surrounds of the areas taken as priorities for conservation. The main hypothesis is that the outcome of human activity in protected areas is mostly due to the social conflicts about these areas than to the aggregation of traditional populations into the process of natural resources sustainable management. The article will also analyze some results of previous research projects: Forest and sea: utilization and conflicts in the Ribeira Valley, SP (Fapesp n. 99/14514-1) and Social conflicts and changes in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest protected areas (Fapesp n. 01/07992-1).

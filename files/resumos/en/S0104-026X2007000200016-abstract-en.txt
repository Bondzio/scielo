The crab (Ucides cordatus) picking, done by cabocla women in Northeast Par√° of the North Coastal Amazon Region, permits the analysis of the environmental question and of gender relations from an anthropological approach on a specific Amazonian traditional population. The environmental question is dealt with in terms of conservation, handling and knowledge about environmental resources. Evidence shows that crab picking is an artisan activity developed in mangrove swamp areas near the town of Guarajubal in which catching and doing product betterment of the crab are women's work, stimulated by the growing demand from nearby urban centers. The work of the catadoras (pickers) allows them to manifest their opinions in relation to the environmental problems, albeit in the local context.

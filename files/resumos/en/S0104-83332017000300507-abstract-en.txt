Abstract The article analyzes, from a gender perspective, a program based on the offer of vocational training in non-traditional occupations for women, developed by the Ministry of labour Argentina during the years 2012 and 2013. This is a paradigmatic program for many reasons: it is the fruit of a public/private joint; seeks to offer a type of technical and vocational training to women that belong to low social backgrounds based on the criteria of the supply side of the labour maket; incorporates a gender perspective, offering a "disruptive" strategy. Through in-depth interviews with different actors (references from the program, teachers and students), the article aims to analyze and contribute with critical reflections around the different conceptions of gender, disputed during the complex process of implementation of the program that generated tensions, obstacles and challenges.

This article proposes a synthesis of Mikhail Bakhtin's dialogical theory and its consequences on the research in Human Sciences. The concepts of text's voices, polyphony and polyssemy are developed toward a critical reading of researches' texts and a new proposition for their writing. To complete and to give a new dimension to dialogical approach, the philosophy of Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard and his conception of discoursive regime become necessary.

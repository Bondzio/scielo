This article examines the combination of interaction routines of the State with social movements in the designing of public policy during the Lula government in three sectors: rural development, urban policy and public security. The central argument is that in a context characterized by unprecedented permeability of the State, social movements and State actors created a historical pattern of State-society interaction. Under the motto "participation of civil society", social movements and state actors resorted to a repertoire of diversified interaction, which included institutional participations, protests, occupying posts in the pubic bureaucracy and personal relationships, with varying emphases depending on past patterns of State-society interactions in each sector.

Abstract The article discusses the challenges to reform the Police in Brazil, based on a brief historical review of the origins of the police force in Brazil and the authoritarian legacy of its institutional structures. Then we present and discuss attempts to reform the police of the state of Rio de Janeiro, focusing especially on the implementation of the Pacifying Police Units (UPPs) and Legal Police Stations (PDL). From these concrete reform experiments are presented and discussed proposals for legal reform entered into the PEC 51, as well as the National Truth Commission report, which suggested a number of reforms of the police structures in Brazil.

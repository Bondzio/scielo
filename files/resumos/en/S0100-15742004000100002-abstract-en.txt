This article aims at understanding the every day situations producing greater school failure among boys rather than among girls in the early grades of elementary school. It is based on a study conducted between 2002 and 2003 involving the ensemble of students and teachers at grades first to fourth at a public school in the municipality of SÃ£o Paulo. This study seeks to understand the processes leading to the fact that a greater number of boys than girls - mostly black boys and/or boys from low income households - get poor grades and are directed to revision classes. The study concludes that there is a need for debate on school culture once it is an important ingredient in shaping boys and girls identities, whether by reproducing stereotypes, gender, race and class discrimination or by building more equalitarian relationships.

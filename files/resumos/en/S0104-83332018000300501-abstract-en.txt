Abstract In this article, I propound an analysis of the limits of a liberal conception of feminism and LGBTIQ+ movements, based on identity and autonomy, and whose struggle is centered in the claim of rights. Through the analyses of the feminist movement of the last years in Argentina (since the &#8220;Ni Una Menos&#8221; phenomenon), I propound a feminism that I call &#8220;radical and plural&#8221;: a feminism that takes vulnerability as the point of departure for political thinking, and that, through the mobilisation of that vulnerability, aims for a deepening of the democratic values of liberty and equality.

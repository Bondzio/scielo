Abstract The article deals with the processes of internationalization and feminization of law which, in Brazil, occurred simultaneously with the stratification of the profession. The massive entry of women into law firms could not reverse the male logic on which it was built, in the early 20th century, as women were concentrated in the early stages of the career. This study examined the main obstacles and the strategies used by women to rise professionally in ten of the twenty largest law firms in the city of SÃ£o Paulo.

Introduction</B></font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Coordination of contractual relationships in    the presence of specific assets has been addressed in the literature on vertical    integration and long-term contracts as presented in Klein (1978), Williamson    (1985), Joskow (1985) and Zylbersztajn and Lazarinni (2005). The literature    on contracts has an unexplored dimension represented by the stability measures    of the contractual relationship. Different from contract duration, stability    explores the frequency with which parties re-contract when alternatives are    available. The study of the determinants of stability of contracts in the Brazilian    wine industry is the key contribution of the paper.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Stability is still more relevant when the focus    is the food chain. Food safety and specific quality attributes are more relevant    today than in the past due to two factors. First, liability related to consumer    rights imposes the design of new tools to coordinate entire food chains. Second,    complex contracts linking specialized agents in the production and distribution    chain are more common. In order to assure quality standards firms have incentives    to cooperate, sharing assets and developing specific tacit knowledge.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> The observation of strategies in the food industry    points to the growing importance of quality-related aspects and, therefore,    the need to structure stable contractual relationships among different and specialized    agents, in the production and distribution chains. Agro-food systems are characterized    by high level of asset specific investments. Changing quality standards, food    safety concerns, time specifications, specific legislation protecting consumer    rights, and environmental awareness are examples of why it is difficult to rely    on autonomous adaptations.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> What makes the food industry particularly interesting    to study is the fact that quality attributes are seldom one-dimensional, most    of the time being the result of collaborative strategies involving several agents    throughout the production and distribution chain. The design of a strictly coordinated    contractual device (Zylbersztajn and Farina, 1999) is necessary in order to    reach the desired quality standards, whether in terms of food safety or other    aspects demanded by consumers.</FONT></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> The wine industry is an example of why strict    coordination is necessary in order to transform the regional technical potential    to produce high quality wines in real performance. The successful example of    Californian, Australian, and Chilean wines indicates that new organizational    architectures are as important as specific regional characteristics in producing    quality attributes. Both traditional countries as well as the new players have    made significant investments in the high quality systems of wine production    (Geene et al., 1999).</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> The Brazilian wine industry is being challenged    by several factors. First, the limited production of classic varietals causes    a problem of stability in the supply of good quality grapes to the industry.    Between 1990 and 1997 about one thousand farmers are reported to have left the    activity (Miele, 2001). Second, persistent problems of horizontal coordination    and controls are observed, due to opportunistic behavior, exemplified, but not    limited to, by the addition of products to the wine. Cheating is possible since    monitoring costs are high, no central authority is &quot;de facto&quot; responsible    for the control, leading to a typical problem of lemons, where good and bad    quality products dispute the market place<a name="tx02"></a><a href="#nt02"><SUP>2</SUP></a>.    Third, the climate in Rio Grande do Sul is borderline to allow for regularity    of desirable quality attributes, with implications for farmers who make specific    investments in classical varieties under risky conditions, so we expect a premium    for coordination efforts. Fourth, the new legislation for denomination of origin    does not provide incentives for farmers to make quality-related specific investments.    Fifth is the level of interest rates, precluding the intentions of farmers to    reform their vineyards. Sixth is the absence of a system to monitor quality    with power to exclude underscored production, and seventh is the cost of production    due to the small scale of production.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> This paper is structured in five parts. Following    this introduction the institutional arrangement is described, focused on the    Brazilian emerging system of top-level varietal wines. The study explores the    contrasts between the governance architecture adopted by low and top quality    wine production. Special attention is given to the differences in the contractual    architecture adopted by different agents engaged in the production of top quality    wines, particularly the farmers' cooperatives, whose importance appears to have    declined in recent years. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Part Three discusses the chain coordination,    based on recent literature, deriving the regularities in contracts between farmers    and industries. Part Four presents the empirical analysis, first defining a    proxy for contractual stability and then testing transaction cost-based explanatory    variables, which are different measures to assess specific investments. A conclusive    discussion is presented in Part Five. Extensions of the approach for addressing    specific aspects of quality in the food industry are suggested. </FONT></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>2. Organization of the Brazilian Industry</B></font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Winery was introduced in Brazil by Portuguese    and Italian colonization that settled in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. It    has been followed by the first independent association of producers, which deepened    the role of coordination in terms of standards and technological innovation.    The Brazilian structure of production in the South is more like the European,    based on small family based vineyards, in contrast with the larger scale seen    in USA or Australia.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> The development of the industry shaped the organization    found in the beginning of the 2000's, in which 90% of the production was made    on 13 thousand small farms. The production of grapes is directed to the market    of juice or to the production of wines, while production for fresh consumption    is organized in the warmer regions, especially in the Northeast area under irrigation.    Small vineyards can be found, with an average scale of 1.9 hectares with a production    of 385 million tons of grapes in 1999, 14% of which are classical vine varieties.    </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">In 2000 the wineries were organized as 276 processing    industries, 22 farmers' cooperatives, and 133 small winegrowers, exploring small    scale, family-made wines, some with well-recognized local brands. Vertically    integrated winegrowers explored a diversified set of activities, including restaurants    and rural tourism.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Based on official data, 8 among the 22 farmers'    cooperatives and 63 among the 276 industries produced wines from classic varieties,    showing a reduction in the participation of cooperatives and an increase in    investment-owned firms. </FONT></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Total wine production in 1999 was 311 million    liters, of which 15% was from classical vinifera varieties. Especial varieties    counted for 10% of the total production of grapes in 2002 and 11.7% in 2003.    The industry shows heterogeneous technological level, declining number of cooperatives,    increasing exports of low value-added grape juice, and an increase in domestic    demand for fine wines.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> We define as top quality the fine wines originated    from classic varieties, under strict control of the winery, and presenting attributes    recognized by the market. Since we have a mixture of easy and difficult to measure    characteristics, we assume that farmers that produce classical varieties are    the ones that supply the necessary (but not sufficient) elements to produce    top level wines. It is possible that good quality farmers also offer low quality    grapes to the industry, since the wineries also sell a range of different quality    attributes at different prices. However, for the purpose of this study, it is    sufficient to know that farmers with low quality do not make specific investments    and are related to the low quality winery. The top quality group make specific    investments and also build more complex contractual mechanisms to provide incentives    and monitoring activities.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> This situation leads to the question of how    to develop incentives to improve the production of classic wines based in long    lasting relations between growers and industries. If, on one hand, technology    adoption is important, this paper suggests that coordination tools must be considered    relevant in order to transform potential into real market participation, especially    due to the risky technological conditions related to quality standards. This    specific aspect will be addressed in the following chapter.</FONT></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>3. Institutional Arrangement of the Brazilian    Wine Industry</B></font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">The co-existence of sub-systems in the Brazilian    wine industry is shaping the private strategies focused on quality. Specialty    wines demand strictly coordinated systems of transactions in order to fulfill    the quality needs of the wineries, which are tied to distributors through long-term    contracts. Some specific features of the industry are germane to this study.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Asset Specific Investments: Specific investments    are necessary in order to structure contract arrangements capable of coordinating    the high quality production chain. Specific equipment is needed by the processing    industry, followed by specific investments in brand development, which in the    Brazilian case is not supported by a well developed legislation of denomination    of origin. Vineyards should make investments in classic varieties, and also    in human capital upgrading its capacity to carry best agronomic practices and    management.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> For the farmers, the specific investment has    a lower value at the alternative allocation, which is production of unbranded    bulk wine or selling to the growing grape juice industry. For the industry,    investments in equipment and brand development, especially related to the establishment    of long-term relationships with the supermarket channel, are necessary in order    to guarantee specific signals from final consumers, transmitted through the    retail chains. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Site and time specificity are relevant, since    contracts are coordinated with a large number of small farmers and the product    is highly perishable, leaving a narrow flexibility window between harvesting    and processing. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Risk: Local climatic conditions of rain and other    natural characteristics can make difficult to maintain stable quantity and quality    of vintages. This introduces a risk element that must be considered in the design    of the contractual relationships between farmers and industry.</FONT></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Land Ownership Structure: Land tenure is based    on small family-owned and managed vineyards. This aspect, added to the hilly    geographical characteristics, precludes the exploration of scale, which shapes    farmers-industry contractual architecture. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Transaction cost economics suggests the need    for strictly coordinated contracts, in order to protect the value of specific    investments. The theory suggests that vertical    integration or long-term contracts are aligned with the characteristics of transactions,    which is in accordance with the observed institutional arrangements. A number    of small and medium size winegrowers are forward integrated into distribution,    with their own brands offering small-scale production for tourists and local    supermarkets. Farmers also show forward integration through cooperatives, improving    the ability to coordinate the production both horizontally and vertically. Long-term    contracts are difficult to set, due to the high instability in production, being    replaced by annual recursive contracts. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"><a href="#tab01">Table 1</a> describes the institutional    arrangement found in the 10 wineries studied. The total production represents    41.2% of the procurement of quality wine-grapes in 1999. Three different institutional    arrangements can be seen, namely, cooperatives, vertically integrated companies,    and market transactions, the supply being complemented by annual contracts between    growers and wineries. Cooperatives showed poorer performance and the data suggest    a declining participation in the industry. Degrees of backward integration in    grape production were found, ranging from zero to 92.6%. Market transactions    complemented the supply needs of the wineries.</FONT></p>     <p><a name="tab01"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v43n2/a08tab01.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Cooperatives were important forms for architecting    vertical and horizontal relationships. If, on the one hand, important improvements    in horizontal and vertical coordination can be provided by marketing cooperatives,    other costs tend to emerge, mostly related to governance and capital allocation    (Cook, 1994). </FONT></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B><I>3.1. Incentives and Monitoring </I></B></font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> In order to provide incentives for quality enhancement    different contractual incentives have been introduced. Payment for quality attributes    is one based on the sugar content, the maturity stage of grapes, the sanitary    conditions, and the acidity of the product. Other aspects are important, such    as the historic information of farmers' characteristics with details on the    mode of transportation, cultivation technology, and storage conditions. The    information was collected by the industries, introducing important reputation    elements in the contract.</FONT></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Most of the wineries provide technical assistance    to farmers, as a way to maintain long-term informal contracts with key suppliers.    This incentive provides relevant information about the adoption of good practices    by farmers. <a href="#tab02">Table 2</a> provides the goals of each of the 10    wineries studied, and the incentive mechanisms built in to the contracts with    suppliers, in terms of price differentials, controls, monitoring, technical    assistance, and supply of clone seedlings. </FONT></p>     <p><a name="tab02"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v43n2/a08tab02.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Even with the incentives provided by the wineries,    the production of varietal clones had decreased in 5 of the 10 industries. The    largest decline appeared in farmers’ cooperatives. Winery A has shown a decline    of 35% in processing, contrasting the period of 90-93 with 94-99. This company    does not adopt incentive mechanisms of price and quality and had shown signs    of moving to low quality, commodity wine, sourcing the product from other wineries.    On the other hand, the wineries that increased its production were vertically    integrated and those that adopt incentives to maintain stable relationships    with farmers.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Provided that the qualitative analysis indicated    the importance of specific investments associated to incentive standards or    other mechanisms for vertical integration, the next part of the paper will search    for quantitative evidences on the stability of contractual relationships between    farmers and wineries. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">The qualitative analysis offered some insights    inviting to a deeper analysis of the contractual characteristics adopted to    coordinate the production. We have chosen a transaction cost perspective approach,    where the re-contracting rate between particular farmers and winery is the dependent    variable. Since we had alternative measures of asset specificity, we have enriched    the qualitative analysis exploring a particular angle of the contractual structure    of production, relating the stability measure with transaction cost explanatory    variables. This approach is unexplored in the literature but is aligned with    Joskow (<I>ditto</I>) approach on contract length in the US coal industry and    Zylbersztajn and Lazzarini (<I>ditto</I>) approach on contract length on Brazilian    seed industry. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>4. Empirical Analysis</B></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">We estimated an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) model    to relate a proxy for stability of the transaction between the vineyard and    the processing winery. The idea is to capture the average frequency of contracts    among the same agents considering the period of five years (t), the 10 wineries    (j), and a sample of 139 farmers (i), taking into account that the vineyards    are free to renegotiate the annual contracts at the end of each period. In this    way, we captured the effects of explanatory variables on the farmers' decision    to re-contract with different wineries. By creating an index of re-contracting,    we have reduced the panel structure of the data to a simpler one, reducing the    time dimension and exploring the farmer-winery relation.<a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><SUP>3</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B><I>4.1. Description of variables </I></B></font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">We defined msv as the average of vintages made    between a farmer and a winery within the sample of 10 processing industries.    The dependent variable captures the average number of transactions, sequential    or not, ranging from 5, if the farmer re-contracts with the same industry during    the five years, to 1, if the farmer contracted a different industry each year.    We named this dependent variable the mean vintages per vineyard. The dependent    variable is based on the observation of transactions between farmer i and winery    j, in year t. For each farmer the average of vintages per winery was calculated.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Explanatory variables are different measures    of asset specificity, namely: </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Age of vineyard: The age is directly related    to the product quality. The local research station specializing in grape and    wine production suggests that the first economic vintage should be made on the    fourth year, but the quality improves after the 6th year. The production period    lasts until the 15th year and the highest quality of the product is reached    between year 6 and 15. In order to capture this condition, a quadratic function    was defined at the equation 1:</FONT></p>     <p align="center"><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Kt = a+b.ivt+c.ivt2 (1),    <br>   where ivt is the vineyard's age.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Distance (dmv): This variable captures the existence    of site specificity and measures its effect on contract frequency. Distance    between each specific vineyard and the industry has been calculated. Standard    distance logistics software could not be used for this purpose, since our intent    is to measure the distance between the specific farm and the vineyard, and the    software offer only distances between cities. The dmv variable was defined based    on the distances table. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Size (scale): This variable captures the effect    of winery scale on the stability of the transaction. Scale here is measured    by the annual production of the winery.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Cooperative (dc): Due to the importance of farmers'    cooperatives in Brazilian agro-food industry and specifically the results of    the qualitative analysis, which indicated the declining importance of cooperatives    in the wine industry, a dummy variable has been defined in order to capture    the particular group. Since farmers tend to transact with more than one industry,    the dummy is considered to be equal to one, if the largest vintage in the five-year    period was made with a cooperative. </FONT></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B><I>4.2 Transaction Cost Hypothesis </I></B></font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> A multiple regression model has been defined    as follows: </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">MSV = a + b ivt + c ivt2 + d dmv + e dc + f scale    + u (2), where <B>u</B> denotes the error term with the well-behaved characteristics    assumed.</font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> The variable ivt captures the asset specific    investment related to the vineyard age, and it is expected that the range between    6 and 15 years should relate positively to the dependent variable and negatively    otherwise. We expect that wineries prefer to re-contract with vineyards that    are more likely to offer good quality grapes. Too young or too old vineyards    are not expected to offer the desirable quality to produce fine wines. It follows    that b is expected to be positive and c should be negative. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">The distance variable, dmv captures site specificity.    It is expected to be negatively related to stability, since the larger the distance,    the larger the risk exposure during the transportation of the grapes from the    fields to the industry. Therefore, this variable captures the effect of perishability,    very common in some food industries, supporting the hypothesis of a negative    effect of this variable, i.e. the smaller the distance the larger the measure    of stability. The processing industry is interested to re-contract with nearby    farmers.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> The dummy variable captures the cooperative    membership effect. On the one hand, since farmers are owners of the cooperative,    a more stable relationship is expected in this type of organization in contrast    with non-cooperatives. On the other hand, the qualitative analysis suggests    that the number of cooperatives is declining in importance, specifically the    ones engaged in the production of fine wines. The relative importance of farmers'    cooperatives is declining, especially in the production of differentiated products.    </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Possibly the best farmers have already left the    cooperative system, preferring the investor-owned industries, which offer extra    incentives in the presence of quality attributes. So, adverse selection applies.    Another argument to support a positive relationship between farmers and the    cooperative is the ideological commitment. So, based on their beliefs, members    prefer to trade with the cooperative, resulting in an expected positive sign    for parameter <B>e</B>.</font></p>     <p><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana">We expect that scale of production be negatively    related to quality. This is associated to the difficulty in coordinating a large    number of suppliers and controlling quality attributes. Smaller wineries, mostly    vertically integrated backwards, are expected to show better capacity to coordinate    the production to reach specific quality attributes.</FONT></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B><I>4.3. Empirical Results and Analysis </I>    </B></font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> We estimated an OLS model using a robust matrix    to correct the heteroscedasticity problem, tested by White's test (Chi-sq (18)    P-value = 0.0343) in OLS usual estimative. Note, however, that the White's statistic    test is in the edge of interval, i.e. the model is not considered homocedastic    only at 1% of significance. This explains why the robust estimation did not    differ much from the OLS estimate. </FONT></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Basic statistic results are presented in <a href="#tab04">table    4</a>. The two parameters related to age specificity did not present a statistically    significant result at the level of 5%, although their signs are according the    expected ones<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><SUP>4</SUP></a>. The variable    ivt associated has been kept in the model, because the usual tests for specification    of nested models, such as F and adjusted-R2, indicated a better specification    with them in. Besides, these variables – ivt and ivt2- are strongly correlated,    as shown in <a href="#tab03">table 3</a>, causing positive bias in estimated    variances and, consequently affecting the significance of t. So, considering    this aspects, we cannot conclude that the vineyard age in not important to explain    the re-contracting, being kept as explanatory variable.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab03"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v43n2/a08tab03.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><a name="tab04"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v43n2/a08tab04.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> <a href="#tab03">Table 3</a> also indicates    multicollinearity with variables dc and scale since cooperatives in general    are large.

<body><![CDATA[<p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> The parameter related to site specificity has    shown a significant negative relationship with the dependent variable. The interpretation    is that the shorter the distance, the larger the expected stability of the contracts    between farmers and wineries, which is a robust result expected from the theory,    therefore confirming our hypothesis. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">The dummy for cooperatives has shown a positive    and significant parameter, leading to the conclusion that cooperative members    show more stable relationships with the cooperative. This implies that the macro-hierarchy    (Lazzarini, et al., 2000.) represented by the cooperative does show unexplored    superior capacity to coordinate both horizontally, among farmers facilitating    the introduction of new varieties and the adoption of technology in general,    and vertically, facilitating the coordination between farm and industry, and    also with farm suppliers, usually intermediated by the cooperatives. Other reasons,    related to the negative incentives provided by this organization arrangement,    however, preclude the exploration of the coordination capacity.</FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Scale has shown a positive significant parameter,    not confirming the working hypothesis. This can be explained, on the one hand,    by the correlation between the size and the cooperatives, therefore interfering    in the parameter estimates. On the other hand, the smaller firms might show    superior capacity to coordinate the production. Deeper analysis should be carried.    </FONT></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>5. Conclusions</B></font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Quality attributes are essential to the food    industry in general and their control introduces important elements for vertical    coordination. This study has shown that the concept of stability of sequential    contracts measured by the frequency of transactions between the same agents,    when choice is possible, can be explained by traditional measures of transaction    cost analysis. Basically farmers and processing industries do consider organizational    elements when drafting contracts. Asset specificity is shown to be relevant,    reinforcing the results found in the literature of economics of organizations    in the last decade. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">The present study reveals that built-in contractual    incentives are important for strategic design. Being so, this opens room for    a research approach in which qualitative analysis can be carried together with    quantitative studies of institutional design of coordination mechanisms in food    chains. </FONT></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana">Since the evolution of food industries show social    impacts in developing countries, the case of Rio Grande do Sul indicates that    institutional aspects must be considered. First, market-augmenting institutions    might be introduced or improved, with the law of denomination of origin and    agencies for monitoring quality, for example. The qualitative analysis has shown    that farmers’ cooperatives do not adopt the same standards of incentives as    observed by non-cooperatives. Also, other incentives related to horizon and    political problems, as explored in the literature on the new generation of cooperatives    (Cook, <I>ditto</I>), are possibly related to the findings of this study. The    result leads to further discussion on the tradeoffs shown by farmers’ cooperatives,    mixing the advantages provided by the personal informal interaction with cultural    ties relating the agents. However, the benefits of the named aspects are crowded    out by the costs associated to the disincentives in terms of property rights    on the residuals, causing each individual farmer to prefer to leave the cooperative    and choose to contract with for-profit companies.</font></p>     <p><FONT size="2" FACE="Verdana"> Finally, since long-lasting relationships evolve    in stable contracts, especially in food chains, an opportunity for further studies    rests in the exploration of the concept of dynamic capabilities, developed among    independent but contract-related agents throughout the food chain. </FONT></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

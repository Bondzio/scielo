Abstract This article aims to qualify the support for democracy in Brazil. He starts from the idea that support for democracy is better understood from a multidimensional point of view. That is, individuals may adhere to different principles underlying democracy, rather than simple adherence to the political regime or not. Our focus is on the Democrats. Based on the multidimensional view, we want to know how democratic are the Brazilian Democratic. To meet this goal, we use the database of the Americas Barometer data from 2006 to 2012. The findings show that there are different levels of adherence to democracy, as the democratic principle in question. Brazilians adhere more strongly participatory dimension, rather than procedural and representative. We have shown, however, that these principles are not strongly connected to each other, ie they can move relatively independently.

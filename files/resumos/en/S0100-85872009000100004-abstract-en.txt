The article examines the phenomenological aspect of Zen ritual in Argentina- more specifically, the practices and representations related to the body, suffering and intersubjectivity. In the first place it focuses on the different ways in which Zen meditation practitioners experience and give meaning to their pain and suffering. Secondly, it analyses how participation in Argentinean Buddhist centers promote a socially and culturally constructed psychophysical habitus, in which somatic modes of attention play an important part. The third part investigates the area of intersubjetivity and intercorporality of Zen communities, in a ritually structured context; this is the borderland of the interrelation with others and where the before mentioned religious habitus is produced.

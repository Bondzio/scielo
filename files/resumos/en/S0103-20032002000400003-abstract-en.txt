This study evaluates the seasonal behavior of floriculture volumes and prices series covering most of the 1990s. The evaluation was accomplished using a periodogram and Box and Jenkins (1976) methodology. Three floral products were chosen for evaluation: rose, chrysanthemum, and violet. Data for the 1990s were collected from CEAGESP-SP - Companhia de Entrepostos e Armazém Gerais de São Paulo, a floral products trade center. Study results show that traded volumes and prices peaked in particular seasons. Information regarding this seasonal period is of extreme importance to the flower and ornamental plant trading systems and allows producers to manage production to increase output at trading peaks.

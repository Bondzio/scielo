How is it possible to identify, understand and explain the meaning of collective actions? That might be one of today's most challenging and controversial questions for Social Theory in general as well as for the Methodology of Social Sciences in particular. From a theoretical outlook, there are several available courses to interpret collective actions and many of them imply the choice of a specific methodological strategy. Therefore, in an attempt to build a research design for the empirical analysis of social protests, some of the basic difficulties facing production of knowledge in social sciences become evident. One of the facets of such challenge is the need to have a critical articulation between theoretical, epistemological and methodological assumptions. This work is aimed at presenting and discussing one of the strategies used to investigate the so-called "Road Blocks" in Argentina as a particular form of social protest, by making their premises explicit. In order to reach the aforementioned aim, the following argumentative course has been selected: a) to summarize the basic epistemological assumptions of the approach adopted; b) to synopsize the set of theoretical tools built; c) to describe data collection techniques; and d) to reflect over difficulties found and the potentialities detected.

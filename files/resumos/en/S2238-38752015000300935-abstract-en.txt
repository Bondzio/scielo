Abstract Modes of proceeding with blind people and the development of techniques, objects and specific interventions that guide their perception of the world are based in the way different scientific fields understand blindness. This article intends to understand the assumptions of a concept of cognition that appears in manuals about the development and learning of blind children and some of their conceptual consequences. It then focus on the methods, didactic or adaptive mechanisms suggested by these manuals for a pedagogy of blindness. Finally, it discusses the practical knowledge and know-how developed by blind people and professionals in a rehabilitation care system that corroborate an understanding of an extended body and cognition while emphasizing the role of the environment and assistive devices in everyday life of blind people.

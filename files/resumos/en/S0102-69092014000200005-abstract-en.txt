The emerging form of sociability in social networking finds shelter on the Internet in a Web whose use comes to be less primarily instrumental to become fundamentally relational. Facebook brings together an exemplary set of technologies and practices of that transition to the so-called social Web. This paper starts from the observation of interactional dynamics that flow in that site to understand the specificity of social life woven by its users. From there the features that outline the design of a new sociability are analysed and its implications for members of the network are discussed, regarding the new ways of expressing themselves, the redefinition of the boundaries between public and private and the own experience of individuality.

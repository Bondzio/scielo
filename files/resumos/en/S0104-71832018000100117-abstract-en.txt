Abstract In presenting a brief contextualization on housing policies in the country, the article initially situates the PAC (re) urbanization project. More specifically, through ethnography, the text seeks to describe the participatory methodology proposed by the agents of the &#8220;PAC social team&#8221; and how such methodology is put into practice, highlighting aspects of an elaborated top-down policy. The paper also seeks to analyze how residents and leaders use the &#8220;official means&#8221; that were made available to them by the PAC, but also some mechanisms that they have implemented in their practices to expose demands and ensure objectives in this process.

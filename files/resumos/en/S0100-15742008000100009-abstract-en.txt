Regardless of recent efforts to overcome the school exclusion, the school failure myth persists and it imposes itself as a device for social banning and perpetuation of the marginalized condition in which the vast majority of the Brazilian population lives. It severely impairs the implementation of a national project for an inclusive and emancipating education. This text analyses the social nature of the school failure concept, considering it as a form of banning whose presence in the school is reinforced by the lack of theoretical studies about the foundations of teaching in contexts of education which host subjects who are at the margin of the modern culture. In this aspect, it discusses where specific knowledge stands in the education of teachers and the need to restore teaching as an academic speciality based on an approach which makes us advance and overcome the technicist conception which prevailed in formal education at the time of the industrial society.

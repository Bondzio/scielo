In this paper I briefly describe some examples of observations I made, while involved in a health care research project, of situations faced by women. The purpose of the exercise was to emphasize the need for an interaction(dialogue)between knowledge, health care practice and feminism. I also discuss some aspects of the interaction(dialogue) between epistemology and feminism in the light of the work of Bachelard as opposed to the views of Dorothy Smith, Alison Jaggar, Susan Bordo, Gayle Rubin and Teresita de Barbieri. Lastly, I attempt a synthesis of what I consider to be the major epistemological ruptures promoted by feminism concerning mainly language and work.

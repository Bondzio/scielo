In this article, I analyze whether the tragedy of the nuclear explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki taught humanity anything definitive, having demonstrated the fatal power of nuclear weapons, thereby justifying their continued ban on Earth. To this end, I discuss to what extent debates on atomic power have had repercussions in Brazil, pointing out the similarities between the arguments used in the bygone 1970s and in the present moment, when certain sectors of the country are contending that in order to ensure our due role in the international political scene we cannot do without atomic power.

The paper analyses results of Programa Acelera Brasil implemented in 24 municipalities between 1997 and 2000. Over 60,000 students participated in more than 2400 classrooms. The main goal was to correct student flows through the implementation of literacy and acceleration programs for over-age students, as well as other strategies to sustain the results achieved. Even though the original targets to promote students to the 5th grade and correct the flow within 4 years were not fully attained, the results suggest a success rate varying from 70% to 90% in the different municipalities. From an economical perspective, over 50 million reais were saved, implying a threefold rate of return. The results obtained led to the massive implementation of the strategy in other states and municipalities, with similar results. The paper ends with a discussion about the contributions of Acelera Brasil to the formulation of consistent public policies to redress student flows.

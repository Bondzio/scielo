Abstract From ethnographic experiences in the sports world, this paper articulates empirical data and theoretical reflections in order to understand the implications to mainstream sport with the presence of non-normative/dissonant bodies that participate in different competitions of the global sports system. We question not only the established normativities in sport, but also the political fictions of masculinity/femininity in its spaces. Thus, we reflect on the otherness present in the sports field up from bodies that suffer/suffered body modification processes or that use drugs and other substances. Gender, sexuality and disability are categories that help us to problematize the construction of knowledges and the political management of the use of bodies in high level athletic performances.

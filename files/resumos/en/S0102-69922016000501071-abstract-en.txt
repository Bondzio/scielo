Abstract This article aims to discuss the theories of recognition as instruments for analysis of street demonstrations that took place in Brazil in June 2013. It examines three authors: Nancy Fraser, Axel Honneth and Judith Butler, describing the central points of the theory of recognition of each one of them, in order to point out the possibilities and limits of its application in the study at hand. The hypothesis that guides the article is as follows: in the 2013 street demonstrations, the absence of organized collective subjects featured a dispersion and fragmentation condition, resulting in a demand for anti-political and individual recognition. Given this scenario, the article concludes that Judith Butler's theses on recognition were the ones that were more appropriate to the analysis of events.

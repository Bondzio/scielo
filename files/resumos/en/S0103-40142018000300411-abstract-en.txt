ABSTRACT The idea for this paper came to me when I sent an email to Carlos Gilherme Mota informing him that, sadly, Peruvian sociologist Anibal Quijano had passed away on May 5, 2018, in Lima. Carlos Guilherme was responsible for Anibal&#8217;s appointment as Visiting Professor at the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) of the University of Sao Paulo (USP). This paper intends to remember how Anibal came to the Institute, offer information on the Peruvian context during his career and point out some connections that he established with the academic milieu in SÃ£o Paulo.

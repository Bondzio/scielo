Based on official statistics of institutions such as the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the Ministry of Labor and Employment, and the Ministry of Education, the paper highlights some of the main trends in the participation of Brazilian women in the labor market, which has been marked by progress and challenges.On the one hand, the massive and steady increase of female participation in the labor market, since the mid-seventies, and on the other hand, the prevalence of high unemployment rates among women and the lower quality of female jobs; on the one hand, the access to prestige careers and jobs, and to management and board positions, and on the other hand, the prevlence of female presence in precarious and informal activities. The profile of female workers: older, married, with children displays a new female identity, both work- and family-oriented. The perpetuation of the notion of female responsibility for household chores as well as for child and family care indicates the persistence of traditional family models, which constitute a burden to female workers, especially to mothers of small children.

Abstract: In order to understand the influence of family socialization in academic achieve differences between girls and boys, a qualitative study was conducted involving eight families of low income in the city of SÃ£o Paulo. This article focuses on the presence of families in the school daily life and the future projects outlined by adults and children. The mobilization of families in the school choice showed no differences according to the sex of the child, but parents followed more closely the education of boys. There was the expectation that the boys enter the labor market for around 16 years old and, in parallel, the girls were involved in household chores since before age 10. And there were subtle differences in parents' expectations, higher for boys' education and profession, although their &#8203;&#8203;sisters were more successful at school and had most ambitious professional plans.

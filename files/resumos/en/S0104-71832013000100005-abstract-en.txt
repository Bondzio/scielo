This article presents a field research about the work protest of the copper industry workers, which is a fundamental productive sector in the Chilean economy. One of the forms the neoliberal management has applied to the work structure is subcontracting or outsourcing. In spite of a great number of objectives and subjectives obstacles, part of the workers subcontracted has unionized in a parallel way, outside the traditional union structures. Not only they did so, but became in one of the protagonists of the social protest in Chile, making visible the social unrest inherent in the neoliberal model, from which the Chilean Case has been presented as its "most successful" experience.

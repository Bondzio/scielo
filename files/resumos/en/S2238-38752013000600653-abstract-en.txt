Abstract This text was originally published in 1908, in German, within Simmel's Soziologie - which is considered his major sociological work. Here I offer a translation of it to Portuguese. In the text itself, the author endeavors to depict and investigate three a priori conditions upon which empirical society, as we know it, would be possible. Simmel himself framed the discussion as a theoretical draft. This draft is guided by a chain of positive and negative comparisons between nature according to Kant and society, and tackles (in a non-systematic, but fairly pioneer fashion, considering the epoch's state of the art) many questions that would turn out to be key ones to the social theory yet to come.

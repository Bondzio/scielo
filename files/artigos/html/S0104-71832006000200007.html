The    first section focuses on the contested nature of the sexual politics that surrounded    the Jacob Zuma rape trial. This sexual politics was not simply the background    to the "real" politics of the leadership succession battle between    pro-Mbeki and pro-Zuma factions. The rise of sexual politics after apartheid,    this paper argues, has largely been due to the politicization of sexuality and    masculinity in response to HIV/AIDS. Section two examines the ways in which    ideas about "traditional" Zulu masculinity were represented and performed    in the Zuma trial, introducing the tension between universalistic sexual rights    and particularistic sexual cultures. The third section of the paper is concerned    with innovative attempts by a group of young men in Cape Town to create "alternative    masculinities" (Connell, 1996) in a time of HIV and AIDS. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Keywords:</B> alternative masculinities, AIDS,    rape, sexual rights. </font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="VERDANA"><B>RESUMO</B></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Este artigo encontra-se dividido em tr&ecirc;s    partes: a primeira enfoca a contestada natureza da pol&iacute;tica sexual que    esteve no entorno do julgamento do estupro cometido por Jacob Zuma. Essa pol&iacute;tica    sexual n&atilde;o foi simplesmente a sustenta&ccedil;&atilde;o da "verdadeira"    pol&iacute;tica da luta pela sucess&atilde;o na lideran&ccedil;a das fac&ccedil;&otilde;es    pr&oacute;-Mbeki e pr&oacute;-Zuma. Este artigo argumenta que o aumento das    pol&iacute;ticas sexuais depois do <i>apartheid</i> deve-se amplamente &agrave;    politiza&ccedil;&atilde;o da sexualidade e masculinidade em resposta ao HIV    e &agrave; Aids; a segunda parte examina as formas pelas quais as id&eacute;ias    sobre masculinidade zulu tradicional foram representadas e demonstradas no julgamento    de Zuma, apresentando a tens&atilde;o entre os direitos sexuais universais e    as culturas sexuais particulares; a terceira parte preocupa-se com as tentativas    inovadoras por parte de grupos de homens jovens na Cidade do Cabo de criar "masculinidades    alternativas" (Connel, 1996) nos tempos de HIV e Aids. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Palavras-chave: </B>Aids, direitos sexuais,    estupro, masculinidades alternativas.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For the past few decades millions of people all    over the world have been exposed to manuals, pamphlets and curricula material    on family planning, reproductive health, STDs, HIV/AIDS awareness, sexual health    and so on. As a result, a standardized and universalised body of medico-scientific    knowledge on "sexuality" has been disseminated on a global scale.    Vincanne Adams and Stacey Leigh Pigg (2005) draw attention to the numerous ways    in which modernising projects that claim neutrality and scientific objectivity    have embedded "sexuality" within taken-for-granted conceptions of    population management, human rights, disease prevention, risk reduction, child    survival, and maternal health (Adams; Pigg, 2005, p. 1).<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><SUP>1</SUP></a>    These sex and development discourses have attempted to create a universal "normal"    sexuality by generating 'specific procedures for knowing, manipulating, and    managing bodies' Adams; Pigg, 2005, p. 2-3). According to Adams and Pigg (2005,    p. 43), a critical analysis of family planning, sex education and HIV/AIDS prevention    programmes reveals how these purportedly rational and purely technical interventions    reproduce 'moral assumptions about the purposes of sexual relations and the    nature of the person'. These pedagogical and developmental processes are the    latest phase in the 'internationalization of sexology and the sexual sciences'    (Adams; Pigg, 2005, p. 41).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In recent years, there has been a massive explosion    of HIV and AIDS prevention and sexual education programmes in developing countries.    Major donors and international health agencies such as the Global Fund to fight    AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), PEPFAR, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and    UNAIDS have provided funding to these global health education programmes. These    programmes, like the family planning and reproductive health initiatives that    preceded them, have contributed towards reinscribing the idea of "sexuality"    as an autonomous and reified domain of social life (Adams; Pigg, 2005, p. 2).    These programmes have also resulted in the medicalization of sexual practices    and heightened tensions between 'a sexuality that is universalised and a sexuality    that is specific in meaning, practice and outcome' (Adams; Pigg, 2005, p. 2).    New conceptions of sexual rights have also been part of this global traffic    in ideas and practices. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The AIDS pandemic in South Africa has opened    up questions on sexuality and sexual rights in ways that were unprecedented    in the past. Partly as a result of exposure to HIV/AIDS prevention programmes,    parents and politicians are increasingly compelled to talk openly about sex    in the home and in public domains. Meanwhile gender, gay, AIDS and anti-rape    activists have responded to the pandemic by highlighting the need to activate    and realise the gender and sexual rights provisions in South Africa's progressive    Constitution. Same-sex marriage laws and anti-sexist legislation, as well as    provisions to protect the rights of women, gay and lesbian citizens and people    living with AIDS, are all by-products of this progressive post-apartheid constitutional    democracy. The constitution, together with grassroots activism, has also contributed    towards generating new forms of sexual politics in which concepts such as misogyny,    patriarchy, sexism, homophobia and harassment have entered into mainstream public    discourse. However, while sexual rights and equality are enshrined in the constitution    and accepted within certain sectors of the public, popular responses to gender    and sexual equality have also been extremely conservative. In addition, sexual    violence in homes and on the streets has reached crisis proportions. So, while    activist and public health responses to the AIDS pandemic may have contributed    towards a "sexual revolution" in terms of which formerly taboo topics    on sex have morphed into morally respectable subjects for discussion and debate    in both private and public spaces, this has not always translated into the kinds    of progressive sexual rights envisaged by the architects of the constitution.    Instead, this constitutionally mandated drive towards sexual equality has catalysed    a popular backlash against certain sexual rights. The recent Jacob Zuma rape    trial was an indication of how far this politicisation of sexuality and sexual    rights has come. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a context of entrenched patriarchal cultures,    HIV/AIDS and extraordinarily high levels of sexual violence and rape, it is    perhaps not surprising that sexual politics should assume such a pivotal position    in political discourse in South Africa. The rise of AIDS, gay and gender activism    has contributed towards transforming "private" sexual matters into    contested public concerns. In addition, like the United States, a conservative    reaction to this "sexual revolution" is being fuelled by the rise    of Evangelical Christianity and the promotion of moralising discourses on "family    values." This backlash is also being fuelled by President Thabo Mbeki's    promotion of gender equality and his suggestion that the next president should    be a woman. These calls for gender and sexual equality have catalysed a conservative    mobilisation of discourses on "African tradition" and Christian family    values. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This clash of values around sexuality was very    evident during Zuma's trial. During the trial, which was held in the Johannesburg    High Court in May 2006, the former Deputy President and his defence counsel    argued that the rape accuser had seduced Zuma by wearing "revealing clothes."    The clothing referred to here was the kanga, a traditional African cloth that    is worn in villages throughout sub-continent. As the <I>Mail &amp; Guardian</I>    reporter Nicole Johnston pointed out the African kanga "has been the hallmark    of female modesty and respectability &#91;and is&#93; handed out at political rallies    emblazoned with slogans and the faces of political leaders" (Johnston,    2006). In the Zuma trial, the mundane cotton kanga was sexualised and transformed    into an object of seduction, much like the infamous cigar during the Monica    Lewinsky and Bill Clinton scandal. Responding to what they perceived to be a    systematic attempt to discredit the rape accuser and portray her as an unscrupulous    seducer, gender and anti-rape activists from the People Opposing Women Abuse    (POWA) faced jeering Zuma supporters as they demonstrated outside the Johannesburg    High Court dressed in cotton kangas. As the journalist Johnston (2006) concluded,    they were demonstrating to "re-appropriate their right to wear the kanga   &#32;&#150;&#32;anywhere, any time". Clearly, sexual politics and sexual rights    are on the rise in the post-apartheid public sphere. Yet, as will be discussed    later in this paper, the trial can be viewed as an example of the clash between    <I>the universality of sexual rights and the particularities of sexual cultures</I>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I><b>Sexual rights and the last frontiers of    democracy</b></I></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Zuma trial and its aftermath included vibrant    public debates about sexual rights, morality, religion, culture and political    leadership. It was a telling example of the complex and contested character    of post-apartheid sexual politics. In a recent article, Eric Fassin (2006) draws    attention to the current rise of sexual politics in France and its concomitant    decline in the United States. This apparent decline in the United States has    followed decades of the politicisation of gender and sexuality, including issues    relating to the sexual liberation, the feminist movement, abortion, sexual harassment,    gay and lesbian rights and HIV/AIDS. During the 1990s, Clarence Thomas and Bill    Clinton were the targets of relentless media attention because the private sexual    conduct of a politician was then considered to be politically significant (Fassin,    2006, p. 79). A decade later, according to Fassin (2006, p. 88-89), the sexual    conduct of politicians and celebrities had become less important in the United    States. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger was recently elected as California's    Governor notwithstanding allegations of sexual harassment. In France, however,    sex matters in national politics, and this is amply demonstrated in recent debates    on the "Islamic veil," sexual harassment, sexual violence, pornography    and prostitution. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fassin (2006) illustrates this shift in France    by showing how French rhetoric on the veil and sexual violence has redefined    "the Islamic veil as a symbolic form of rape&#32;&#150;&#32;male imposition, in    opposition to female consent."<a name="tx02"></a><a href="#nt02"><SUP>2</SUP></a>    He views these developments, which resonate with the kanga debate in South Africa,    as part of "the internationalization of sexual politics" (Fassin,    2006, p. 92). Modern democracies, it would seem, are increasingly concerned    with questions of sexual equality between homosexuals and heterosexuals, as    well as between men and women. "The politicization of sexuality",    Fassin (2006, p. 92) concludes, "partakes in a broader process of denaturalisation    of the social order &#91;and is&#93; therefore an object of democratic debate...This    is why sex is the last frontier in the democratic definition of our societies".    This paper reflects on the rise of sexual rights and sexual politics in one    of the newest democracies, South Africa. It frames sexual politics in South    Africa within the context of public discourses on sex, masculinity and HIV/AIDS.    Whereas race and class dominated oppositional politics during the apartheid    era, sexual and gender rights now compete for space in the post-apartheid public    sphere. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The paper is divided into three sections. The    first section focuses on the contested nature of the sexual politics that surrounded    the Jacob Zuma rape trial. This sexual politics was not simply the background    to the "real" politics of the leadership succession battle between    pro-Mbeki and pro-Zuma factions. The rise of sexual politics after apartheid,    this paper argues, has largely been due to the politicization of sexuality and    masculinity in response to HIV/AIDS. These responses include activist mobilisations    and public debates and competing perspectives on AIDS treatment and the official    AIDS prevention messages of abstinence (A), be faithful (B) and condomise (C).    Section two examines the ways in which ideas about "traditional" Zulu    masculinity were represented and performed in the Zuma trial, introducing the    tension between universalistic sexual rights and particularistic sexual cultures.    It then proceeds to locate hegemonic masculinities within the context of the    political and moral economy of sex in contemporary South Africa. The third section    of the paper is concerned with innovative attempts by a group of young men in    Cape Town to create "alternative masculinities" (Connell, 1996) in    a time of HIV and AIDS. It focuses on Khululeka, a Cape Town township-based    support group for men living with AIDS. Khululeka, is an offshoot from the AIDS    social movement Treatment Action Campaign (TAC). It was formed largely in response    to the belief by its founder, Phumzile Nywagi, that township men are "sexually    irresponsible" and conspicuously absent from public clinics and HIV/AIDS    support groups. Whereas TAC tends to be a predominantly rights-based movement    largely comprising women, Khululeka has attempted to address men's issues, including    dominant male sexual cultures. It has sought to fashion new "alternative    masculinities" at a time when Africa men are increasingly singled out in    the media and popular discourse as the source of sexual violence and HIV infection.    The paper will argue that hegemonic masculinities are beginning to be challenged    "from below" by small community-based initiatives such as the Khululeka    Men's Support Group. The paper is specifically also concerned with constructions    of dominant "traditionalist" masculinities and innovative re-constructions    of these masculinities "from below".</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Section 1: Zooming in on Zuma and sexual cultures    in a time of AIDS</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The 2006 rape trial of former Deputy-President    Jacob Zuma provided the perfect setting for the staging of an extraordinary    national drama about sex, gender, morality and political leadership in the new    South Africa. Zuma was ultimately acquitted and the rape accuser was portrayed    by Justice Willem van der Merwe as a manipulative seductress, a pathological    liar and a serial rape accuser. The Judge also lashed out at the media, activists    and Zuma supporters for prejudging the case and being more interested in sexual    and gender politics than the actual evidence presented in the rape case. The    Judge chastised pressure groups, NGOs, governmental organisations and the media    for having "breached the <I>sub judice </I>rule." In the preface to    his 174 page judgement delivered in the Johannesburg High Court on 4<SUP>th</SUP>    May 2006, the Judge argued that 'it is not acceptable that a court be bombarded    with political, personal or group agendas and comments. As one contributor to    a daily newspaper very correctly put &#91;it&#93;: "This trial is more about sexual    politics and gender relations than it is about rape."' In his final concluding    statement, the Judge also lambasted Zuma for having unprotected sex with an    HIV-positive woman and being unable to control his sexual desires. Quoting Kipling,    Judge van der Merwe concluded, "If you can control your sexual urges, then    you are a man, my son". </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This moralising tone from the Judge, as well    as from other quarters, served to unleash angry responses from Zuma's supporters.    For example, in a public statement on the 25<SUP>th</SUP> May 2006, Senzeni    Zokwana, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) attacked what    he identified as a hypocritical form of "Christian morality" that    judged and condemned Zuma for his sexual behaviour. According to Zokwana, not    all NUM's members were Christians, and not all of them adhered to the Ten Commandments'    prohibition on adultery: "We are not Christians. We won't listen to the    Ten Commandments and we don't have to listen when Christians tell us adultery    is wrong." This statement triggered heated discussions on the Friends of    Jacob Zuma (FJZ) website about the relationship between sexuality, morality,    Christianity and the secular state (see <a href="http://www.friendsofjz.co.za" target="_blank">http://www.friendsofjz.co.za</a>).    Pro-Zuma contributors belonging to the trade union movement, the South African    Communist Party (SACP) and ANC Youth Leagues supported Zokwana's statement and    portrayed Zuma as a "man of the people", a heroic fighter for the    liberation of the black working class, the downtrodden and destitute. "Lekua",    a vehemently pro-Zuma contributor to the website, defended Zuma's moral integrity,    and Zokwana's statement, in a posting on the 25<SUP>th</SUP> May, 2006. Lekua's    posting, with its binary opposition between Zuma's organic connection to popular    classes and Mbeki's association with the educated, modern elite, resonates strongly    with a historically inscribed divide amongst Xhosa-speaking people in the Eastern    Cape Province between the rural-based "traditionalists" or "red    people" (<I>ababomvu</I>) (from the custom of decorating body and clothes    with ochre) and the urban, "detribalised", Christian educated Africans    or "school people" (<I>abaseskolweni</I>) (see Mayer; Mayer, 1961).    This divide, Lekua's website intervention suggests, is expressed through elitist    Christian attitudes towards sexuality and morality.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#91;...&#93; &#91;There is&#93; selective morality, namely      that it is alright for a woman to lay a false rape charge but it is uncalled      for for JZ to have breached his marriage vows. NUM &#91;Zokwana&#93; said: "NUM      does not subscribe to the Ten Commandments, especially the one that says "Thou      shall not commit adultery." This hardline stance by Cosatu and its largest      affiliate, NUM, clearly shows that the whole nation is getting impatient with      the hypocrites who behave as if they are hollier &#91;sic&#93; than JZ and all of      us. Their dictatorial tendencies has &#91;sic&#93; inspired the whole nation into      action to <I>reclaim the ANC from the elites and restore it to the masses      who are still poor and destitude</I> &#91;sic&#93;. (emphasis added).(Friends of Jacob      Zuma).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Other responses to Zokwana's statement included    an article by Dele Olojede and Mfundi Vundla published in the Sunday Times (May    28 2006, p. 21):</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Leaders of the youth wing of the ANC deride      President Thabo Mbeki as an anti-Zuma conspirator who is out of touch with      "the street". They excuse moral laxity &#91;of Zuma&#93;, if not outright      criminality, as inconsequential in weighing fitness for office. The trade      unions say they will not listen to "Christians" lecture them about      promiscuity. The communists say gender equality is immaterial, and dismiss      the potential of a female president out of hand (Dele Olojede and Mfundi Vundla,      'Black men, white lies: The time has come for the communists and unions to      stop hiding behind the fiction of a united &#91;ANC tripartite&#93; alliance.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> This public debate on sexual morality was set    against the backdrop of a bruising battle between supporters of President Thabo    Mbeki and former Deputy President Jacob Zuma. Zuma's supporters believed their    leader should become the next President, notwithstanding President Mbeki's dismissal,    in 2005, of Zuma from his position as Deputy President. This followed the decision    by the prosecuting authority to prosecute Zuma on corruption and, some months    later, rape charges. These trials, as well as President Mbeki's calls for the    next president to be a woman, were seen to be part of an elaborate anti-Zuma    conspiracy orchestrated by the Office of the President.<a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><SUP>3</SUP></a>    The FJZ website had hundreds of postings alleging plots perpetrated by Mbeki's    inner circle, the media, big business, neo-liberals, and even "Christians".    Intense debates about "the Zuma Affair" took place in the media and    on the FJZ website. For example, following Zuma's rape acquittal, Zizi Kodwa,    the ANC Youth League's spokesperson, referred to "a brood of fangless vipers    in the mass media" (<I>Mail &amp; Guardian</I>, May 26, 2006). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meanwhile, media commentators and gender activists    claimed that the trial was a lens onto the rise of an authoritarian and sexist    culture of patriarchy, misogyny, and sexual violence. Journalists covering the    daily demonstrations outside the Johannesburg High Court reported on Zuma supporters    who burnt photographs and effigies of the rape accuser and chanted "burn    the bitch". Zuma's supporters, many of whom wore "100% Zulu Boy"    T-shirts, were also accused of intimidating anti-rape activists protesting outside    the court. The latter had launched a "One in Nine Campaign" to draw    attention to the fact that so few women are prepared to report their rapes to    the police. Rape activists highlighted the fact that there were 55,000 reported    cases of rape in 2004/05 whereas the South African Law Reform Commission had    provided estimates of 1,69 million rapes per year (<I>Sunday Independent</I>,    April 16, 2006). Gender activists also questioned the judge's decision to permit    the defence to lead testimony on the complainant's sexual history, a decision    that activists believed was designed to demonstrate that she had a history of    false rape accusations going back to her childhood. The Judge demolished the    complainant's evidence, and endorsed Zuma's claim that he had consensual sex    at his home in November 2005. Activists argued in the press that the treatment    meted out to Zuma's rape accuser from both the Judge and Zuma's supporters would    simply reinforce this "one in nine" syndrome amongst rape victims.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After the judgement against the "kanga-clad    seductress", gender activists appeared to have even stronger grounds for    believing the judicial system would continue to be perceived by rape victims    to be unsympathetic to their predicament. Some activists claimed that the relentless    cross-examination of the complainant by Zuma's defence lawyer constituted "secondary    rape" of the victim by the criminal justice system. Zuma's acquittal, they    argued, would also be interpreted by many of his followers as vindication of    their patriarchal beliefs and claims that women are predisposed to fabricate    rape in order to access money and power. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was not only the gender activists who were    enraged by Zuma's sexual behaviour. Zuma had also angered AIDS activists with    his court testimony that he had sex without a condom with an HIV-positive woman    because he had calculated that the risk of infection was low. Zuma also told    the court that by showering after he had sex with the rape accuser he intended    to reduce the risk of infection. According to AIDS activists these statements    contributed towards widespread confusion and misinformation about HIV/AIDS,    including the proliferation of AIDS myths, dissident theories, and popular beliefs    that sex with virgins could cure AIDS and that the disease was caused by witchcraft    (Robins, 2004). In his press conference a day after the acquittal Zuma apologised    for having made a "mistake" by having "unsafe sex" with    an HIV-positive woman. He stated that he would recommit himself to promoting    AIDS prevention programmes. Yet, he still sought to justify his shower statement    by telling a female journalist, "If you've been in the kitchen, my dear,    peeling onions you wash your hands, not so? What's so funny about washing my    hands after doing something?" (<I>Mail &amp; Guardian</I>, 12 May 2006,    p. 31). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gender and AIDS activists and media commentators    argued that Zuma's trial highlighted the patriarchal sexual cultures of South    African society. It also mirrored the dismal failure of the national political    leadership to confront sexual violence and HIV/AIDS. After all, Zuma had been    the president of both the Moral Regeneration Campaign and the South African    National AIDS Commission (SANAC), government bodies that activists regarded    as entirely ineffectual. These failures of government were perceived to be especially    disturbing in a country with a "rape pandemic" and an estimated 5-6    million people living with AIDS. AIDS activists slammed the national leadership    for a series of failures including President Mbeki's controversial denial of    the scale of the pandemic, his questioning of the link between HIV and AIDS,    and his support for dissident claims that antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) were dangerously    toxic (see Robins, 2004). Similarly, the Minister of Health had infuriated AIDS    activists by supporting the dubious AIDS remedies of vitamin manufacturer Dr.    Matthias Rath and promoting her own 'African solution' for AIDS comprising a    diet of garlic, onion, the African potato and olive oil. Zuma's sexual behaviour    and court statements were, from the perspective of activists, yet another leadership    blunder. So, notwithstanding a progressive constitution that promised sexual    rights and gender equality, as well as health care for all, the sexual and political    cultures of both the leadership and the popular classes seemed to stand in the    way of realising these rights. The shadow side or underbelly of this progressive    constitutional democracy was graphically illustrated in the postings on the    Friends of Zuma Website.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I><b>The gendered underbelly of South Africa's    constitutional democracy</b></I></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While Jacob Zuma faced the hostility of the media    and gender and AIDS activists, he attracted considerable popular support from    the Friends of Jacob Zuma Coalition&#32;&#150;&#32;an umbrella of organisations including    ANC Youth League, the South African Communist Party's Young Communist League    and the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veteran's Association. The Friends of Jacob    Zuma Trust had also bussed in supporters to the High Court from Zuma's political    support base in KwaZulu-Natal Province. Fundraising concerts and rallies were    held in Soweto and other parts of the country. ANC sources claimed that Libyan    leader Moammar Gadaffi was funding Zuma's rape and corruption trials (Letsoala,    2006). Zuma's support came from a variety of sources including Zulu traditionalists,    supporters of patriarchal ideas and practices, African nationalists and 'the    popular Left'. Zuma supporters were particularly upset with President Mbeki's    introduction of quotas for women in political office as well as his call for    the next President to be a woman. Mbeki's ANC government was also perceived    to be undermining the powers of traditional leaders through local government    reform. Demonstrations outside the court included the presence of <I>iinyanga</I>    (traditional healers) using herbal medicines to ensure that Zuma was successfully    acquitted in his trial. Meanwhile chiefs (<I>amakosi</I>) dressed in traditional    skins occupied the front seats of the courtroom during proceedings. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Friends of Jacob Zuma Website provides an    insight into the conservative underbelly of South Africa's progressive constitutional    democracy. It reveals the profoundly conservative character of the gender and    sexual politics that animated popular support for Zuma. The following contributions    were posted on the website on the days running up to the court judgment on 8<SUP>th</SUP>    May 2006. They dealt with a number of issues related to the trial, including    claims that an Mbeki-led "Xhosa Nostra" had used the rape accuser    as a sexual pawn in a political conspiracy to destroy the Zulu-speaking Zuma's    prospects of becoming President. Postings also claimed that President Mbeki    wanted his female Xhosa-speaking Deputy President, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, to    succeed him in order to prevent Zuma from assuming the mantle of the Presidency    when Mbeki stepped down after his second term.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So the president has spoken the next president      of RSA should be a "woman".

These claims that the    ANC leadership was dominated by Xhosa-speakers had a long history. Mbeki was    also associated with government attempts to undermine the authority of traditional    leadership and patriarchal structures, especially in the Zulu-speaking Kwazulu-Natal    Provicne, the stronghold of both Chief Gatsha Buthelezi and Jacob Zuma. The    rape trial was seen by Zuma supporters to be simply the latest manifestation    of this pro-woman, anti-male traditionalist "Xhosa conspiracy."<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><SUP>4</SUP></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The ANC was torn down the middle by the sexual    politics surrounding the rape trial, and its implications permeated every level    of political life from rural villages in KwaZulu-Natal to the top echelons of    the ruling party and state institutions.<a name="tx05"></a><a href="#nt05"><SUP>5</SUP></a>    These developments split the ANC into two factions, those who supported Zuma's    populist leadership and those who supported Mbeki's more centralist and managerialist    approach. The politics of gender and sexuality were very much part of this leadership    struggle. The following section draws attention to the ways in which sexual    culture featured in the Zuma trial and its aftermath.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Section 2: "Culture talk" and hegemonic    masculinities: sexual rights and sexual culture in the new South Africa</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whereas during the liberation struggle and the    first decade of democracy (1994-2004) questions of sexuality hardly ever entered    public political discourse, Judge van der Merwe believed that media commentators,    gender activists and Zuma supporters viewed the trial as being primarily about    sexual politics. The trial also reinforced stereotypes about "sexually    irresponsible" African men. Such representations of African sexuality had    been vehemently contested by President Mbeki. In fact, the President's AIDS    denialism seems to have been fuelled by his belief that AIDS and anti-rape activism    reinforced racist 'western' ideas about promiscuous and disorderly African sexualities    (see Robins, 2004).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> This was also evident in President Mbeki's attack    on the anti-rape activist Charlene Smith. In his weekly letter posted on the    <I>ANC Today website</I>, the President claimed that Smith's shocking rape statistics    reproduced racist stereotypes of black men as habitual rapists. A similar attack    was launched by ANC portfolio committee members against filmmaker Cliff Bestall    for producing a devastating television documentary on baby rape. While raising    these troubling questions about "African sexuality," especially masculinity,    had been challenged by the President and ANC national leadership, the Jacob    Zuma rape trial appeared to insert sexuality and masculinity squarely within    the public sphere. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Zuma trial placed the intimate details of    sex under full public scrutiny. Never before in South Africa had a senior political    leader been subjected to such a public investigation of his "private"    sexual conduct. Zuma's rape accuser was a 31 year old HIV-positive AIDS activist    whose supporters had given her the name "Khwezi" (Star). Khwezi was    exposed to ceaseless probing about her sexual history by the defence lawyer.    She was questioned about why she wore "revealing clothes"&#32;&#150;&#32;   a kanga without underwear&#32;&#150;&#32;in the house of Zuma, a father-figure and    long time friend of her parents during their years in exile. She told the court    that she would never have seduced Zuma, who she referred to as <I>malume</I>    (father's brother), and whom she claimed to treat like her own father. She also    told the court that she was a lesbian and had not been interested in having    sex with Zuma. Yet, when she told the court that she had been raped three times    as a child, and that she "froze" when she saw the naked Zuma standing    with an erect penis next to her bed, the defence countered that if she had been    raped so many times she ought to have "developed ways of resisting rape".    Why had she not screamed and fought off Zuma's advances, the defence argued.    The defence lawyer also argued that a "sane man" would never have    committed rape knowing that there was a policeman on the property and that his    daughter was sleeping a room in the same house. Zuma's defence counsel called    a number of witnesses, including priests and trainee-priests, who claimed that    they too had been falsely accused of rape and that that the complainant was    a compulsive liar and serial rape accuser. The Judge found the defence witnesses'    testimonies to be plausible and ruled against the complainant.<a name="tx06"></a><a href="#nt06"><SUP>6</SUP></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The defence's line argument, a number of media    commentators argued, was symptomatic of a broader culture of patriarchy that    clashed with a progressive Constitution that promoted gender and sexual equality.    What was particularly interesting about trial was the way in which Zuma described    his sexual behaviour by drawing on ideas about "African culture."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I><b>Sexual culture versus sexual rights?</b></I></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"Culture" became the keyword in popular    and media understandings of "the Zuma affair". Writing about Zuma's    dismissal as Deputy President in 2005, the University of the Western Cape political    philosopher and media commentator, Anthony Holiday, argued that this signalled    the dawning of a new corporate 'culture of competence' in which traditionalism    had no place (<I>Cape Times</I>, June 27, 2005). Holiday added that Zuma is    an African communitarian leader without the access to the kinds of cultural    capital and formal education required to thrive in the modern capitalist worlds    of 'high finance' and 'high politics.' As he put it, 'Formality had ousted African    spontaneity and it was the formality, not of the tribal "Great Place",    but of the courtrooms, boardrooms and chancelleries of the "developed"    world.' Holiday argued that Zuma did not survive precisely because his brand    of African communitarianism was not attuned to the needs and demands of modern    democracy and corporate capitalism. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zuma came across in Holiday's analysis as a Zulu    traditionalist whose leadership style is diametrically opposed to the modernist    Presidency, Mbeki Inc. Zuma's court appearance during his rape trial in April    2006 seemed to confirm this. He spoke in isiZulu throughout his cross-examination    and repeatedly drew on traditionalist idioms and "cultural rules"    to buttress the defence's argument that he had consensual sex with the 31-year    old woman accusing him of rape. For example, he spoke of how in Zulu culture    "leaving a woman in that state &#91;of sexual arousal&#93;" was the worst    thing a man could do. "She could even have you arrested and charged with    rape," he told the court. He addressed the judge as 'nkosi'&#32;&#150;&#32;yenkantolo    (the king of the court) and referred to his accuser's private parts as isibhaya    sika bab'wakhe&#32;&#150;&#32;her father's kraal. He also conceded that he entered    this kraal without ijazi ka mkhwenyana&#32;&#150;&#32;the groom/husband's coat, or    what non-Zulu-speakers would call a condom. These translations of isiZulu idioms    are usually associated with "deep" rural KwaZulu-Natal. To those attending    the Johannesburg High Court hearing, and millions of others following the trial    through the extensive media coverage, these words signified that Zuma was indeed    a "real" Zulu man: "100% Zulu boy" as his supporters' t-shirts    put it. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was in his discussion of lobola (bridewealth)    that Zuma publicly displayed his Zuluness most vividly. In response to questions    about two" aunts" who had attempted to initiate lobola negotiations    with the complainant, Zuma answered that he would have "had his cows ready".    He claimed that it was not unusual in Zulu custom for a woman who had not had    a love-relationship with a man to start lobola negotiations for him. As he put    it, "Lobola is an issue between the girl, for instance, and the family.    Should she had told these two ladies that 'Yes, I want Zuma to pay lobola',    I would definitely do it." Lobola, and patriarchal conceptions of women    and sexuality, became the site upon which this claim to Zulu authenticity was    played out. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zuma's court statements seemed to suggest that    he was indeed an authentic Zulu traditionalist, as commentators such as Holiday    implied. However, this timeless representation of Zuluness was delinked from    the modern legal setting within which this performance of "Zulu culture"    was taking place. Zuma's lawyer, Kemp J. Kemp, no doubt advised him that this    approach was strategic and effective in making the case that the sex had indeed    been consensual. Zuma's behaviour was, after all, how Zulu men are meant to    act, so this patriarchal argument went. What was important here was that this    particular understanding of Zulu masculinity was being self-consciously fashioned    and situationally deployed by Zuma in the Johannesburg High Court and in a post-colonial    country internationally praised for its progressive, modern constitutional democracy.    This situated performance of "Zulu manhood" was also mediated to South    Africans and the wider world via television, radio, the Internet and a local    and international press fascinated with primordialist fantasies of Zulu culture    and sexuality. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This construction of African masculinity was    not that different to the ideas about Zuluness and customary law produced by    Shepstone and countless other colonial officials. Historians and anthropologists    have shown how these historical constructions of "tradition" and "customary    law" were produced through ongoing "conversations" between colonial    administrators and tribal elders (Channock, 1985; Hamilton, 1998; Mamdani, 1996).    In the Johannesburg High Court in May 2006, South Africans witnessed a "postmodern"    spectacle in which a tribal elder-cum-liberation struggle icon performed "Zulu    tradition" for consumption by both the court and the broader citizenry.    This version of "African culture," which was packaged by Zuma as primordial    ethnic essence, was designed to prop up Zuma's legal defence of consensual sex.    This strategy was perceived by his legal team to be effective precisely because    South Africa in a postcolonial country in which reified conceptions of African    culture carry considerable clout in the courts and on the streets. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The problem with analyses by Tony Holiday and    other media commentators is that they failed to recognise that the former Deputy    President could represent himself as both a diehard African traditionalist as    well as a modern revolutionary and former trade unionist. Neither did these    political analysts seem to take cognisance of the fact that Zuma's support base    comprises traditional leaders and rural "traditionalists" as well    as modernists and scientific socialists within the Communist Youth League, the    ANC Youth League and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). For    Zuma and his supporters within the SACP, ANC, and trade unions, being a 'traditional    Zulu man' and a modern revolutionary was neither contradictory nor incompatible.    Instead, Zuma's popularity was precisely because of his ability to invent himself    as a "man of all seasons" and ideological persuasions, a post-ideological    position that straddled the political binaries of Left and Right, modern and    traditional. What united his diverse constituency was a particular representation    of "traditional" masculinity and conservative sexual politics. This    distinguished his culturally hybrid leadership style from strictly corporate    executive style and liberal modernism of President Mbeki, a man who promoted    gender equity and quotas for women within the ANC and all political structures    in the country. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">South African political culture has been characterised    by competing tendencies: liberal democracy and corporate capitalism on the one    side, and African communalism, traditional patriarchy and African socialism    on the other. The former draws on liberal modernist ideas about rights and Constitutional    democracy, while the latter speaks the language of "African culture"    and the communal solidarity of "the masses." These apparently contradictory    political logics sometimes collide with each other, but at other times appear    to co-exist. Zuma embodies a post-modern political pastiche that seamlessly    combines neo-liberal corporate capitalism with patriarchal traditions of African    communitarianism. This hybrid cocktail of "Afromodernism" is expressed    in Zuma's embrace of reified conceptions of Zulu masculinity alongside his close    ties to new corporate elites such Shabir Shaik and his embrace of the popular    Left, including the SACP and trade union movement. Yet, notwithstanding Zuma's    "100% Zulu boy" court performance, his own life history and struggle    affiliations demonstrate that he is comfortable in the roles of both modern    revolutionary and traditionalist elder. This cultural hybridity looks very different    to Tony Holiday's binary vision of the "Great Divide" between Zuma    the Zulu traditionalist and Mbeki the liberal modernist. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Feminists responding to the Zuma acquittal suggested    that it could be a major setback for women's struggles for sexual rights, and    could discourage women from reporting rape. It could also have implications    that go well beyond sexual violence. For instance, it may signal a shift towards    "traditionalist" populism and the reinforcement of patriarchal ideas    and practices that are not all that different to the Zulu traditionalist politics    of Inkatha in the 1980s. It also has significant implications for court challenges    to the implementation of the Communal Land Rights Act (CLRA), an Act that stands    to buttress the power of traditional authorities at the expense of rural women.    Like the Zuma affair, the CLRA is not simply a clash between modernity and tradition;    instead it is a new phase in the modernisation of patriarchal traditionalism    and its re-articulation within a modern bureaucratic system, one built upon    the legal and political foundations and legacies of colonial policies of indirect    rule (Mamdani 1996). Perhaps Zuma is the public face of this post-liberation    modernization of patriarchal tradition. The public response to the Zuma trial    suggests that this patriarchal regime is being subjected to challenge and contestation    from a variety of NGOs, women's movements and the media. The following sections    of this paper will argue that this dominant masculinity is also being challenged    by small community-based initiatives such as the Khululeka Men's Support Group.    The discussion below is concerned with the implications of post-apartheid sexual    cultures "from above" as well as innovative cultural constructions    of new masculinities "from below".</font></p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><I><b>Historicising masculinities: unmaking patriarchy    and remaking sexualities</b></I></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In 2003 a South African Department of Health    Report (Department of Health, 2003, p. 11) entitled <I>Men in HIV/AIDS Partnership:    "Men care enough to act"</I> reported on a series of consultative    workshops in which men identified the following themes and strategies for tackling    HIV and AIDS: unequal sexual and gender relations, culture and traditional values    such as polygamy, <I>lobola</I> (bridewealth) and virginity testing, and gender    stereotypes and masculinity. The workshops concluded that there was a need to    embark upon education and awareness programmes that targeted young boys from    the age of five to eighteen years in order to "challenge the status quo    and the men's world view" (Department of Health, 2003, p. 11). Despite    identifying these strategies and objectives, government has done very little    in terms of grappling with these questions of culture, identity and masculinity.    Moreover, the Department of Health's Report demonstrates no attempt to historically    contextualize African sexuality and masculinity. The Report restates a stereotypical    view of "African sexuality" whereby multi-partner behaviour is understood    to be rooted in traditional African beliefs and practices (Caldwell; Caldwell;    Orubuloye, 1992; Caldwell; Caldwell; Quiggan, 1989). Similarly, Caldwell, Caldwell    and Quiggan (1989) draw on essentialist notions of an "African system of    sexuality"&#32;&#150;&#32;characterised by "sexual networking" and "traditional"    sexual permissiveness and promiscuity. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These ahistorical conceptions of "African    sexuality" ignore a growing literature on changing historical constructions    of African masculinities and sexualities (Cornwall; Lindisfarne, 1994; Delius;    Glaser, 2002; Heald, 1995; Hoad; Martin; Reid, 2005; Mark Hunter, 2005, 2006;    Mills; Ssewakiryanga, 2005; Moodie, 1994; Morrell, 2001; Niehaus, 2002; Ouzgane;    Morrell, 2005; Reid; Walker, 2005; Richter; Morrell, 2006). Recent historical    and ethnographic research has critiqued these essentialist ideas of "African    promiscuity" (Heald, 1995; Mark Hunter, forthcoming). For example, historians    have drawn attention to the existence, in many parts of Africa, of sexual restrictions    and stringent rules of respect and avoidance (see Delius; Glaser, 2002). This    literature also documents the breakdown of these sexual strictures under historical    conditions of underdevelopment and poverty (Ouzgane; Morrell, 2005). For example,    Margrethe Silberschmidt (2005, p. 200) argues that socio-economic change and    poverty in East Africa since the 1980s have produced new forms of male disempowerment    that have often resulted in violence and sexual aggressiveness. This male sexuality,    Silberschmidt argues, has "become fundamental to a process of restoring    male self-esteem" in times of unemployment and the failure of men to meet    their expected social roles as heads of households, fathers and breadwinners.    In other words, these are not static models of traditional African patriarchy    and male domination. Recent studies in southern Africa draw attention to similar    processes and changing constructions of masculinities (Heald, 1995; Mark Hunter,    2005, 2006; Jewkes; Abrahams, 2002; Niehaus, 2005; Ouzgane; Morrell, 2005; Reid;    Walker, 2005; Richter; Morrell, 2006; Wood; Jewkes 2001). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mark Hunter's (2006) work in rural KwaZulu Natal    focuses on changes in the "political economy of sex" that are partly    responsible for fuelling the South Africa AIDS pandemic. Hunter challenges stereotypes    that blame AIDS on "African culture." He also questions political    economy approaches that attribute the pandemic primarily to legacies of racial    capitalism and apartheid and the destruction of African family structures through    the system of circular male-migration. While not denying the historical role    of apartheid in undermining African family structures, Hunter's work highlights    relatively recent changes to the political economy of sex. He shows how, since    the 1970s, dramatic changes in cultures of sexuality have occurred as a result    of the combination of rising social inequalities, structural unemployment, greatly    reduced marital rates and new forms of domestic and sexual fluidity (see Spiegel,    1995 on domestic fluidity). These developments have rendered both men and women    more vulnerable. Studies suggest that the combination of male disempowerment    and chronic poverty has, in certain cases, contributed towards aggressive male    sexualities, which has in turn fuelled the spread of the pandemic (Hunter, 2006;    Wood; Jewkes, 2001). These developments have also introduced changes in female    sexuality, including forms of transactional sex for both survival and to support    modern consumer lifestyles and identities (Mark Hunter, 2006; Leclerc-Madlala,    2004). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Historians and anthropologists have also shown    that in the past, in many parts of Africa, there were highly structured and    culturally mediated ways in which young people were initiated into adulthood    and adult forms of sexual activity (see Delius; Glaser, 2002; Mark Hunter, 2006;    Monica Hunter, 1936). For example, during the nineteenth century in parts of    southern Africa, penetrative sex, fathering and fatherhood were linked to building    a home (Mark Hunter, 2006). In Zulu-speaking parts of South Africa the <I>umuzi</I>    (homestead) was headed by an <I>umnumzana</I> who could, depending on the resources    available, marry polygamously. The sons of the <I>umnumzana</I> would later    marry and break away from their father's <I>umuzi</I> in order to establish    their own. Women moved from their father's lineage to their husband's through    the giving of <I>ilobola</I>, usually cattle. <I>Lobola</I> was less a form    of 'bride price' than it was a 'child-price'&#32;&#150;&#32;an exchange for woman's    reproductive capacity, i.e., her ability to produce birth. In such as system,    sex amongst young people was highly structured and <I>ilobola </I>regulated    when young men had the right to marry and have children. Having children without    having these 'sexual rights' would result in the young man's family having to    pay <I>inhlahulo</I> or damages for impregnation. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These cultural practices were subject to rapid    and dramatic social change. In the early decades of the twentieth century, when    increasing numbers of young men began to migrate to South African cities to    search for work, they gained some independence in terms of <I>ilobola</I> payment.    This allowed them to build their own families and homesteads without having    to rely on their fathers' permission and help. However, with the decline of    the migrant labour system since the 1970s it has becoming increasingly difficult    for young men in Southern Africa to find permanent jobs. This era of structural    unemployment has in turn made it extremely difficult for young men to pay <I>ilobola</I>    and thereby get 'properly married.' These dramatic changes are of course not    confined to South Africa but are being experienced in many parts of sub-Saharan    Africa. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Responses to these changing structural conditions    of everyday life are often interpreted through the lens of ahistorical stereotypes    about a singular "African sexuality." This is certainly the case in    media reporting on men and HIV/AIDS. Liz McGregor's (2005) <I>Khabzela: The    Life and Times of a South African</I> is a powerful and honest attempt to account    for the life and death of Fana Khaba, a young Soweto man who, in his prime as    a popular Yfm radio DJ, died of AIDS on the 14<SUP>th</SUP> January 2004 at    the age of thirty-five. <I>Kabzela</I> is a moving account of a young man from    a poor family in Soweto whose celebrity status fuelled his sexually promiscuous    lifestyle. He was hailed as a hero for 'coming out' on radio about his HIV-positive    status. However, he could not come to terms with his HIV seropositive status,    and he stopped taking anti-retrovirals after visiting 'alternative healers'    and <I>sangomas </I>(traditional healers or diviners). After being visited by    an "emissary" from the South African Health Minister, he opted for    an 'African solution' that included a diet of garlic, onion, potato and olive    oil. He died shortly thereafter. McGregor's sensitive account of Khabzela's    life and death, like Zuma's trial, raises difficult questions concerning hegemonic    masculinities and sexual cultures. It is this question that animates the work    of Khululeka, a men's support group in Cape Town.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Section 3: 'Brothers are doing it for themselves':    from social movement to men's support group</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Oscar award winning South African film <I>Tsotsi</I>    tells the story of a fearless and violent township gangster who, as young boy,    ran away from home after his abusive father refused to let him near his mother    who was dying of AIDS; the father believed that his son could be infected by    touching his HIV-positive mother. One day Tstosi shoots a black woman while    hijacking her car outside her middle class suburban home. As he speeds off from    the house in the woman's BMW he hears a baby crying in the back seat of the    car. He eventually decides to take the baby to his township house and this dramatically    changes his life. Through trying to care for the infant, Tsotsi goes on a road    to Damascus conversion process, and he decides to return the infant to its parents.    The film ending hints that he decided to turn his back on crime and gangsterism.    This redemptive storyline also suggests that even violent young men may be amenable    to radical change and reform. It also hints that fatherhood can become a catalyst    for the construction of new "responsible masculinities." It also contests    popular and media images of young black men as the source of the problem of    HIV/AIDS, domestic violence and rape. Tsotsi's redemptive narrative resonates    with the stories of young men living with AIDS who have sought to transform    their lives as a result of illness experiences and their recognition of the    need to lead healthy and sexually "responsible" lifestyles and assume    the "proper" social roles of fatherhood.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a recent conversation with Phumzile Nywagi,<a name="tx07"></a><a href="#nt07"><SUP>7</SUP></a>    a forty-three year old AIDS activist, he told me that these days Xhosa initiation    rituals are unable to teach young men to act responsibly. He claimed that most    young men were "useless and irresponsible", and that they went to    initiation school but then continued being irresponsible when they returned    from the bush. He concluded that he preferred counselling women, because they    took HIV and AIDS very seriously:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You know, initiation as it is, it doesn't mean    anything nowadays. Its just pain, it seems. It doesn't give any way forward    to life. One would just go initiation for the sake of going there. But not knowing    the concept traditionally, how our rituals &#91;demand&#93; that you have to change    your lifestyle, to know yourself. But other people out there, one would go to    initiation and come and do the same thing that he used to do. I mean there don't    seem to be regulations around sex. I mean young people can sleep around with    who they want. Or am I wrong? The church may say things, but do people listen.    Parents may say one thing, but do they listen. Is there any authority, or is    it the case that it's anarchic, and youth can do as they want?<a name="tx08"></a><a href="#nt08"><SUP>8</SUP></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In September 2005, Phumzile Nywagi, a former    Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and <I>Medicins san Frontieres</I> (MSF) AIDS    activist, established Khululeka Men's Support Group in Gugulethu, a working    class Xhosa-speaking township in Cape Town. It is one of a handful of support    groups in South Africa that focus specifically on men's issues. Khululeka was    started in response to Phumzile's observation that men were virtually invisible    in community health clinics and AIDS support groups. All of the members of this    group were open about their seropositive status, and their aim was to provide    "safe sex" education and treatment literacy in the communities in    which they lived. In addition, since most of Khululeka's members were unemployed,    the group wanted to develop opportunities for skills training and job creation.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The members of Khululeka regarded men as their    primary target in their efforts to challenge AIDS stigma and promote healthy    lifestyles and "safe sex" practices. They also tackled how problems    of unemployment, poverty, and HIV impacted on men's sense of identity and dignity.    According to Phumzile, "When you are HIV-positive, and on top of that you    are unemployed, you can lose everything. Your wife and children don't respect    you because you are sick, without a job and now you cannot provide for them.    You are nobody. You are useless. This is why we have created Khululeka, to help    men discover their manhood and dignity again." "Themba", another    Khululeka member stated the following: 'We saw that men were nowhere to be seen    at support groups and clinics. They only visit clinics when they are seriously    ill. They also sleep around, drink and smoke too much, and this is problem when    you take ARVs. This is why we decided we need to work with men." </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Khululeka</I> is a Xhosa word for 'freedom',    'to be free', or, as Phumzile put it, 'It means to feel free to talk about HIV.'    The support group comprised a group of twenty young men, many of who had participated    in MSF and TAC antiretroviral (ARV) treatment programmes in Khayelitsha, Cape    Town. All of the members lived openly with HIV, and spoke about how disclosure    allowed one to 'feel free' and that this strengthened one and made one better    equipped, both physically and psychologically, to deal with HIV and AIDS. According    to Vuyisa, "AIDS is just a mind game" and unless you develop the right    psychological attitude you will be broken down and lose all strength and hope.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">HIV is just a mind game. But if you treat it      like any other disease, like TB, then you can challenge it and do like you      are now. If you are diagnosed, your first thought is you will die. But now      it is different&#32;&#150;&#32;we have ARVs. Now behaviours need to change and so      do life styles. ... My dreams vanished when I was diagnosed. When I was      first diagnosed, I couldn't wash myself, walk or feed myself... It was      as if you are turned around back into being a baby...</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Khululeka</I> was involved in numerous community    based activities, including AIDS awareness and sex education campaigns in public    spaces such as township <I>shebeens</I> (taverns), railway stations and taxi    ranks, on community radio talk shows, and at funerals of people who died of    AIDS. They were also involved in collecting money for families that were unable    to pay funeral costs, and visited HIV-positive people in hospitals and their    homes. The group's meeting place was a Rotary Club-funded shipping container    in the backyard of Phumzile's house in Gugulethu. They also had outings and    <I>braais</I> (barbecues) where they socialised and discussed matters of common    concern. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Khululeka</I> emerged in the context of the    double burden of HIV/AIDS and structural unemployment. Studies suggest that    in the past young men stood a much better chance of gaining access to formal    employment that allowed them to pay <I>ilobola</I> (bridewealth) and thereby    marry, have children, and establish relatively stable family households. During    the past three decades, however, dramatically rising rates of unemployment (currently    estimated to be 30-40%) have made this life cycle trajectory increasingly difficult    achieve. This has in turn undermined the ability of young men to assume the    social roles of fatherhood. Mark Hunter (2006, p. 106) observes that many Zulu-speaking    men in KwaZulu-Natal are abandoning pregnant women because of conditions related    to poverty and unemployment. Many of these men are extremely frustrated at not    being able to conform to accepted social roles of fatherhood, including paying    <I>inhlawulo</I> (damages for impregnation), <I>ilobolo </I>(bridewealth), and    acting as a 'provider'. This creates conditions whereby manliness is partially    boosted by <I>fathering</I> children, but at the same time those men who are    unable to fulfil the social roles associated with <I>fatherhood</I> are branded    as unmanly and 'irresponsible' (Mark Hunter, 2006). One of the reasons for the    establishment of <I>Khululeka </I>was to address these obstacles to social reproduction    and enhance the capacity of men to fulfil these social roles of fatherhood.    <I>Khululeka</I> also aims to promote AIDS awareness and 'responsible lifestyles.'</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Support groups such as <I>Khululeka</I> are attempting    to address some of these issues. They are also involved in mediating new scientific    and medical knowledge and technologies (i.e., anti-retroviral therapy or ART)    as well as new forms of 'responsibilised' citizenship that are deemed to be    necessary for treatment adherence and 'safe sex' to take root. Two <I>Khululeka</I>    members were trained as treatment literacy practitioners by TAC and MSF, and    one of them was able to find employment as an AIDS counsellor for a medical    insurance company. For <I>Khululeka's</I> members, being permanent volunteer    activists was no longer financially viable. Most of the men were between thirty    and forty years old and were keen to establish stable families. Having managed    to come to grips with their sero-positive status, and having accepted the reality    of life-long commitment to ARV treatment, they turned their attention to the    challenges of acquiring skills so that they could find permanent employment    and formalise their relationships through marriage. For many their hope was    to find work as state paid AIDS treatment literacy practitioners, patient advocates    and councillors within the public health sector. These concerns to secure employment    did not preclude commitment to fighting AIDS denial and lack of knowledge about    HIV and ARV treatment in their communities. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I>Khululeka</I> is an innovative off-shoot of    the South African AIDS activist movement, but it departs in significant respects    from the organisational forms and objectives of TAC and MSF. Whereas TAC comprises    90 percent women, <I>Khululeka</I> is one of a small number of men's support    groups in South Africa. It focuses exclusively on working class African men,    a social group that tends to avoid interacting with the public health system.    Public clinics in South Africa tend to be 'women's spaces,' and men arrive at    clinics only when they are seriously ill and 'disappear' once they have been    treated. In many cases HIV-positive men come in for the treatment of opportunistic    infections such as TB and pneumonia, and vanish before they can be properly    counselled and prepared for life-long anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Poor drug    adherence has become a particularly worrying trend given the very real dangers    of drug resistance. <I>Khululeka</I> seeks to address these problems by acknowledging    men's specific desires, needs and vulnerabilities.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I><b>Illness narratives, treatment testimonies    and new sexualities</b></I></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Recognising the dangers posed by drug resistnace,    South African public health professionals and AIDS activists argue that rights    to health care need to be complemented by 'responsible' medication adherence    and sexual behaviour and healthy and stress-free lifestyles. This is also part    of a shift from popular struggles over access to treatment to concerns with    the demand for ("uptake") health care, health system responsiveness    and secondary and tertiary prevention. From these public health perspectives,    what is needed for AIDS treatment and prevention programmes to succeed is both    a well-run and responsive public sector health system and empowered, knowledgeable    and "responsibilised" client-citizens. Public health professionals    and activists are in fact calling for an effective health system together with    new forms of community participation and citizenship, or what Arjun Appadurai    (2002 describes as 'governance from below.' It is these concerns that are at    the heart of the focus of MSF, TAC and Khululeka on innovative community-based    initiatives in sex education, treatment literacy and social and economic support    for people living with AIDS. These approaches have created the conditions for    the emergence of new social identities, including the new masculinities that    seem to be emerging as a result of community-based initiatives such as Khululeka.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">MSF, TAC and Khululeka all subscribe to this    "governance from below" approach, yet they are also quite different    in their social composition and orientation. MSF is a global NGO of health professionals,    TAC a national organization led largely by professionals with popular participation    mostly by unemployed black African women, and Khululeka is a grassroots CBO    of unemployed and working class Xhosa men led by someone with tertiary education    and employment.<a name="tx09"></a><a href="#nt09"><SUP>9</SUP></a> Notwithstanding    these differences, all three organisations have been involved in common AIDS    activist projects and approaches that have created the conditions for the emergence    of new social identities, including the new masculinities that seem to be emerging    as a result of community-based initiatives such as Khululeka. It would seem    that these new masculinities and identities are very much in the making and    draw on more established ideas about masculinity. In other words, these ideas    about sexuality and masculinity are still in the process of being fleshed out    and negotiated. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The following quote illustrates how the reinterpretation    of the virus by Khululeka members has become a catalyst for the emergence of    post-apartheid political struggles and generated new forms of participation.    During a group discussion with Khululeka members in Gugulethu on 18<SUP>th</SUP>    February 2006, "Thabo", a forty-something year old former ANC liberation    fighter described how diagnosis with AIDS could destroy one's sense of manhood    and hope for the future. He recalled that after his diagnosis he had had virtually    no support, "Even my brothers wouldn't support me." Thabo described    how he had left South Africa in 1982 to enlist with Mkhonto we Sizwe, the military    wing of the ANC. He returned to South Africa in 1994, and in 2003 became very    ill and decided to be tested for HIV. He interpreted his involvement in AIDS    activism as another struggle for dignity:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I decided to get tested for HIV when I got      TB in 2003. It wasn't nice to be ill. I didn't know what will happen after      the diagnosis. All of my problems started after I began disclosing my status.      I first told my brother, but he betrayed my trust by telling all of his friends.      It is one's right to keep one's status private. But I needed to disclose my      status... For me, HIV is another campaign. The first battle was for racial      equality&#32;&#150;&#32;to be treated like a man, though one is black... Everyone      must be tested because the virus has no colour...</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">"Thabo" explained how illness, AIDS    stigma, and the fear of dying were a devastating concoction, especially for    African men whose identity was intimately tied to sexuality and reproduction:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Especially here in Africa, sexual issues are      men's pride. Here as an Africa man you are being judged according to how many      women you have. I mean especially among young ones, it's very rare that you      find a young man having one girlfriend, for example. Most of the time...      men marry more than one wife... Every man judges his future and well being      according to the size of his family &#91;laughter from others in the room&#93;. So      the doctor says, "My friend, I'm very sorry you're HIV-positive.' So      you just have to stop everything. Imagine that. This makes a vacuum in somebody's      heart &#91;laughter&#93;. All the plans you have are gone. So you find out you are      HIV-positive and you say, "I am no longer a man, I have to do away with      all my girlfriends.' So this is when the fear and stigma starts. Many people      believe that if you're HIV-positive you only have a period of 3 or 5 years      and then you're gone &#91;laughter&#93;. And you had all these plans...</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Other comments about men, sex and HIV that emerged    from the discussion with Khululeka members included the following</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Men don't' come out openly &#91;about their status&#93;.      They are not like women, they are usually scared. This is the purpose of a      men's support group. We talk together about things we cant' discuss with female      partners.    <br>     Some men want to sleep around to feel stronger.    <br>     Most men thought that having sex with women was a necessity, but sexual activity      generally decreased after diagnosis.    <br>     Men often expect to have sex without a condom because they have "paid"      for their wives through lobola &#91;bridewealth&#93;.    <br>     I often ask "Where are the guys in support groups and treatment literacy      meetings?" I ask women where their partners are. Many say that they have      left them.    <br>     Domestic violence is done by us... We are trying to change.    <br>     Black men have been oppressed&#32;&#150;&#32;they lack jobs, housing, shelter, which      leads to a higher risk of encountering other social ills such as prostitution...      This is not a colour question. It is about poverty and traditions.    <br>     For me, it is very strange to tell my sexual issues to a woman.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the case of many Khululeka members the devastating    experiences of HIV illness, stigma and fear were lessened by joining Khululeka.    In interviews with Phumzile it became clear that he too had been through similar    illness experiences. In fact, the MSF's Dr. Eric Goemaere recalled that when    Phumzile was carried into the MSF clinic in Khayelitsha in 2000 he already had    full-blown AIDS, and was close to dying. Elsewhere I have argued that it was    this kind of illness experience, followed by ARV treatment and immersion in    AIDS activism and support group activities, can under certain conditions contribute    towards a dramatic transition from "near death" to "new life"    (Robins, 2006). The following illness narrative and treatment testimony by Phumzile    illustrates the power of these socio-biological processes and how they can contribute    towards new HIV-positive identities that include new conceptions of masculinity    and sexuality.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><I><b>"I am like a born-again... ARVs    (antiretrovirals) are now my life"</b></I></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Phumzile is a former TAC and MSF activist living    with AIDS in his early forties. In 2001 he became desperately ill. He had headaches    and dizziness, he suffered from thrush and a range of other opportunistic infections,    he had lost almost 30 kilograms, his CD4 count was down to 110, his viral load    was 710 000, he could not walk, he was barely conscious at times. He secluded    himself in a room in his sister's house waiting for death. Dr. Eric Goemaere,    the MSF doctor at the Khayelitsha clinic that Phumzile attended, recalled that    Phumzile was "nearly dead" when he was carried into the clinic' (personal    communication, February 2006). On November 12 2001, he became one of the first    fifty clients to participate in MSF's ART programme in Khayelitsha. His recovery    was dramatic: after six months his viral load had dropped to 215 000, his CD4    went up and he was feeling much stronger. When I met Phumzile in 2004, his viral    load was undetectable and his CD4 count was 584. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Clinical indicators such as normal CD4 counts    and undetectable viral loads do not adequately convey the social, psychological    and spiritual recovery that Phumzile and others have experienced on their journeys    from "near death" to "new life". Neither do these indicators    account for why Phumzile, viewed HIV as "a blessing in disguise."    For Phumzile, getting his life back through ART was a gift from God that he    could not afford to squander.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm not a church-goer &#91;but&#93; my faith comes      from the time I got sick... In the bible there is the story of a sick beggar      on the road. Jesus comes by and tells the beggar to stand up. And he stands      up. The miracle of Jesus revived him from death so that he could heal other      people through the belief that Jesus is on earth. Faith is in yourself. If      you don't believe in yourself, who do you believe in? God brought me back      to life for a purpose. He wants me to go out there and talk to people. He's      giving me another chance. A day could cost me a lot if I don't speak about      HIV... <I>I am like a born-again</I>. ARVs, that's where my commitment      comes from. It's like committing yourself to life because the drugs are a      lifetime thing. ARVs are now my life. If I did not ignore life I would not      be on ARVs...</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the TAC national congress in Durban in 2003,    before the announcement of the national ARV rollout, I witnessed TAC members    giving impromptu testimonies of their treatment experiences. Each highly charged    treatment testimony was followed by outbursts of song, dance and struggle chants:    'Long live, Zackie, long live. Long live, TAC, long live.' Phumzile Nywagi's    input at the TAC congress in Durban captured the flavour of these testimonies:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm Phumzile from Cape Town in the Western      Cape. I was diagnosed in 2001... I was very sick. When you get sick, you      just ignore it. You say: "Oh, it's just the flu." You're in the      denial stage. You say your neighbour is a witch ... We thought this disease      belonged to other people elsewhere in Africa. From my point of view, HIV is      real, it's here. I never thought I would be here today. I couldn't stand,      I was sick. My CD4 count was 110 and my viral load was 710 000. Then I started      ARVs with MSF in Khayelitsha. Now I'm strong...(Phumzile, forty-two year      old male AIDS activist and founder of <I>Khululeka</I>).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These treatment testimonies&#32;&#150;&#32;with their    references to CD4 counts, viral loads and the role of TAC in giving them "new    life"&#32;&#150;&#32;have a quasi-religious quality. They also express the sense    of personal empowerment that comes from having survived the passage from "near    death" (i.e., full-blown AIDS) to recovery (Robins, 2006). As will be argued    below, this passage from illness to health can also serve as a catalyst for    the construction of new HIV-positive identities and new masculinities. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Concerns about how to establish and maintain    a stable and cohesive family in times of AIDS and widespread unemployment also    featured prominently in discussions with Phumzile. He spoke about how, following    his diagnosis, he had suicidal thoughts, 'But then I thought about my children,    and what it would be like for them to grow up without a father.' He claimed    that even though he had separated from his first wife, his illness had in fact    strengthened his relationship with his children. He wanted to provide them with    fatherly direction and support. Having got his life back through ARVs, Phumzile    was determined to build a future for himself and his family. He remarried an    HIV-positive woman and their infant recently tested sero-negative. He was employed    as a tele-counsellor for HIV-positive clients belonging to a medical insurance    company, and the men's support group he had started was growing. Looking back    on his life, Phumzile spoke about how he had erred by not taking life, and the    threat of HIV, more seriously. He claimed that his lifestyle of "sexual    recklessness" and "womanising" had led to his HIV-positive status    and illness. Given his illness experiences, he was determined to be a responsible    father and to teach his children to value life:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&#91;...&#93; I used to take things for granted.      I used to ignore things. I used to not to care. I'd say, 'That won't happen      to me.' The way I see things now is very much different. That if you don't      think of tomorrow, you are nothing. You know, if you don't think of your future,      or the people out there, or your kids. That was my major problem. Now I realise      my kids wouldn't love to live without their father. Even if I am not staying      with them, I must give moral support, give them life, and give them direction      to life. So, that's what I'm doing right now. Its time to put my feet on the      ground and change the way I see things... At the age of forty you find      out that &#91;you&#93; have wasted many years along the way there, doing nothing at      all. Not focusing on the right way to succeed. Not having the vision that      sometime I could have my own house, my own children, my own car, have a good      job, be a father... It's very hard these days, given unemployment and lack      of opportunities &#91;but&#93; you have to have a vision... </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After Phumzile had returned to health through    ARV treatment he was able to start the long process of remaking his life, both    in terms of his family and personal lifestyle and in relation to his contribution    to his community. New conceptions of manhood and sexuality were key aspects    of this process of identity construction.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Beyond rights? Concluding reflections on sexual    politics and alternative masculinities</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The aftermath of the Zuma Affair(s) threatened    to completely unravel the liberation movement-cum-ruling party's historical    alliance and political solidarity with the SACP and COSATU. This vicious succession    battle was expressed through a cultural politics of gender and sexuality that    reflected profound tensions between constructions of "traditional"    African masculinity and a rights-based discourse on sexual rights and gender    equality. While it appeared as if these concerns were simply background to the    "real" politics of the ANC leadership crisis, this paper has argued    that the rising significance of sexual rights and sexual politics animated the    tensions between the pro-Mbeki and pro-Zuma camps. The reasons for this is that    sexual and gender rights have, over the past decade, increasingly become a key    theme in South African national political discourse. This has largely been due    to the politicization of sexuality and gender as a result of public scrutiny    and criticism of the government's responses to AIDS. This paper has also argued    that in the shadows of the national political drama surrounding Zuma's trial    were innovative localised attempts by men living with AIDS to create alternative    masculinities and "responsible" sexual behaviour in a time of AIDS.    While the Khululeka Men's Support Group may appear to be an isolated community-based    initiative, it reveals that there are indeed local challenges to hegemonic masculinities    in post-apartheid South Africa. These community-based initiatives are also linked    to the work of post-apartheid social movements such as the TAC. Although these    initiatives are linked to rights-based struggles they also go beyond rights    by seeking to create new communities, identities and cultures of masculinity    and sexuality.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The story of Khululeka also reveals how, community    activism can, under certain conditions, contribute towards the "conversion"    of HIV-positive people into committed and "responsiblised" citizens    (see Robins, 2006). The paper has suggested that these community-based initiatives    can contribute towards the renegotiation and reinvention of South African masculinities    and cultures of sexuality in a time of AIDS. They can also offer alternatives    to the kinds of "traditional" African masculinities performed by Jacob    Zuma in the Johannesburg High Court in May 2006.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ADAMS, Vincanne; PIGG, Stacy Leigh (Ed.). <I>Sex    in development</I>: science, sexuality, and morality in global perspective.

The former are accused of exposing the latter    to rape&#32;&#150;&#32;not symbolic rape but real rape. Either way, for its critics,    there is something intrinsically degrading about the veil: because it represents    female sexuality as both indecent and impure, it requires women's desires (and    desirability) to be concealed, or otherwise defiled. This suggests that women    cannot freely chose to wear a veil; they are victims. But should they feel free    to do so, they would become accomplices, guilty of depriving other women of    their freedom not to wear one..."    <br>   <a name="nt03"></a><a href="#tx03">3</a> Postings on the Friends of Jacob Zuma    website also attacked the complainant for falsely accusing Zuma and accused    her of being part of an organised political conspiracy to prevent Zuma from    becoming the next President. 'Lets be fair' referred to the seven year imprisonment    of a Thai woman for making false rape reports and suggested that Zuma's accuser    should get similar punishment: "Comrades, we all agree rape is a serious    crime and rapists are no better than murderers. What then of women who falsely    accuse men of rape?? Should they not be permanently removed from society? A    woman who falsely accuses a man of rape is as guilty as a rapist especially    when the evidence clearly shows she is a serial false accuser, has been paid    to make the accusation and attempted to extort money from the person she falsely    accused."&#32;&#150;&#32;'Lets be fair', 07/05/2006 (Friends of Jacob Zuma).    <br>   <a name="nt04"></a><a href="#tx04">4</a> A response from "Vuyo" to    an earlier posting (by Musa Nxulu) called upon Zuma supporters to refrain from    creating ethnic and tribal tensions and suspicions within the ANC. "Musa    Nxulu wena kwedini your problem is that you are tribalist, you believe in the    Zulu Nostra, we are not all naive and stupid as not to see that. You painted    Xhosas with dirty colours and the unwise words &#91;and now&#93; innocent Xhosas feel    rejected and threatened by Blood thirsty hooligans who claim to be Zulu faithfuls.    Are you happy? ... Is Jay Z's &#91;Zuma&#93; court verdict worth innocent lives of    Zulu and Xhosa children who played no part in any of this?"&#32;&#150;&#32;Vuyo    in Libode, 02/05/2006 (Friends of Jacob Zuma).    <br>   <a name="nt05"></a><a href="#tx05">5</a> The Minister of Intelligence, Ronnie    Kasrils, was accused by the ANC and South African Communist Party (SACP) Young    League leadership of being the shadowy figure behind a political conspiracy    engineered by the Mbeki cabal. The Youth League leadership claimed that the    rape accuser's telephone calls to Kasrils a few days after the alleged rape    were ample evidence of his complicity in this Mbeki-led conspiracy. Kasrils    responded by lashing out at his detractors whom he claimed had not provided    any evidence of such a conspiracy.    <br>   <a name="nt06"></a><a href="#tx06">6</a> For the full judgement see <I>Mail    &amp; Guardian</I> website: &lt;<a href="http://www.mg.co.za/specialreport.aspx?area=zuma_report" target="_blank">http://www.mg.co.za/specialreport.aspx?area=zuma_report</a>&gt;.    <br>   <a name="nt07"></a><a href="#tx07">7</a> Taped interviews with Phumzile Nywagi    were done in Cape Town on 15<SUP>th</SUP> September 2005 and 4<SUP>th</SUP>    October 2005.

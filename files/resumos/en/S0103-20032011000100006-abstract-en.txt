This study analyzes the contribution of Pronaf (National Program for Strengthening of Family Farming) for the sustainable development of family farming in the Cear√° state. For this purpose, primary data was obtained through the application of 15 questionnaires to beneficiaries and the equal number to non-beneficiaries in Baturite, Iguatu and Quixada counties, totaling 90 questionnaires. The sustainability index, employment and farm income per cultivated hectare were calculated to measure the impact of the program on the sustainable development, generation of income and employment on family farms of beneficiaries. Based on the descriptive analysis and the application of the t Student test, Chi-Square test and Mann-Whitney U test, comparisons between the selected groups of family farming were promoted. Results showed that the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries have a low sustainability level. Pronaf had a positive impact, but not significant on farm income generation, and positive effect on the creation of employment.

In this article we discuss challenges raised by new reproductive technologies, especially those concerning the reproductive rights of HIV-positive persons as seen by Law faculty members. Our approach pinpoints questions brought up in the academic literature analysed based on bibliography and interviews. Results indicate the aspects present in speeches about reproductive rights from different stands, including biorights as a new field of knowledge. What stands out is, on one hand, a strict understanding of the concept of autonomy when it comes to reproductive matters in which the argument of the best interest of the child prevails, and, on the other hand, a moralizing view over whether HIV-positive individuals may have children.

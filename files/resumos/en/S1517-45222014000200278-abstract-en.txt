In this book, Richard Sennet examines the premises of cooperation in contemporary society as well as how cooperation has been politically shaped through history. Divided into three parts, including a description of the evolution of cooperative rituals starting in the medieval times, the book deals with the nature of cooperation, why it became weak, and how it could be strengthened.

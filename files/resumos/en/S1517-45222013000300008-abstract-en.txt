In Colombian territory, displaced people comprise a peculiar category of migrants, since they live under a provisory condition and are entangled in multiple uncertainties. This article presents a characterization of the ambiguity involving the social protection system and the social policy aimed at mitigating poverty among the displaced population. The causes of the phenomenon are related to persistent inequalities and to the action of illegal groups for taking control of territories in strategic areas for drug trafficking, political power, and arms trafficking and smuggling. The repeated failures and omissions in relation to the displaced population demonstrate the inability of the Social State of Law (Estado Social de Derecho) for consolidating the social policy as an institutional strategy.

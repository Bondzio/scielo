In this article, we look at a theme of special relevance to the current Latin American political context, the State. Revisiting Ruy Mauro Marini&#8217;s writings, one of the main references to the Marxist Theory of Dependence, we pretend to highlight its formulations on the Latin American States, especially on their dependent nature, which, we argue, is a subject loosely studied by the recent recoveries of his work. So, this article began with important considerations about Marini&#8217;s conception of the State, emphasizing its affiliation to the Marxist theoretical tradition. Further, the study focus on the particularities of the Latin American dependent capitalist State, with special attention on two themes that represent, in our view, two important contributions of Marini to the analysis of the Latin American States, which are: his formulations on sub-imperialism and the State of counter-insurgency.

This paper investigates shrimp small and median farms performance in Rio Grande do Norte in two steps. First, technical efficiency was estimated by nonparametric production frontiers, data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Free Disposal Hull (FDH). As a second stage, after DEA and FDH analysis, the degree of inefficiency was explained by a statistical Tobit model, in terms of managerial indicators and localization. Average efficiencies were bigger for the extensive and semi-intensive production system. The results indicated that some managerial practices did not reduce the inefficiency. The localization affected inefficiency: producers within estuaries associated with the emissions of small amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus were efficient, i.e., a best use of inputs can reduce environmental impacts.

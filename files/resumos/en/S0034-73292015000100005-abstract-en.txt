The prioritization of the South-South axis during the Lula da Silva government is consensual among analysts of Brazilian Foreign Policy regarding its international insertion, as well as the prominent role given to the African continent. In order to provide empirical analysis to the reprioritization of relations between Brazil and Africa, this paper aims at comparing the technical cooperation provided by Brazil to African countries during FHC (1995-2002) and Lula da Silva (2003-2010) administrations. Its primary source of analyzed data, little explored by the Brazilian academic literature yet, was the databank of the Department of International Acts of the Ministry of External Relations.

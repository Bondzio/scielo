abstract This article is based on the theoretical categories of "Globalization", "Territory" and "Development," and seeks to identify the territorial changes brought by the presence of hydroelectric ventures. The social subjects involved are the owners of hydroelectric plants, those directly affected by them, public managers and leaders of the "Movement of People Affected by Dams". The scenarios are the strategies of governments and private groups, as well as visions of social groups affected by hydroelectric ventures. The data point to a set of territorial changes, new economic activities and significant changes in social relations.

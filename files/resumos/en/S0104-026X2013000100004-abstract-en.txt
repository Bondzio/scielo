The article collects and discusses feminist approaches to International Relations. The encounter between the fields of Gender Studies and International Relations dates back to a little over two decades, and represents a movement that was almost simultaneous to the beginning of what is called in the IR field the "third debate". In this sense, besides discussing the use of gender as a category of analysis for international relations, the article intends to argue that this use of gender in IR is closely connected to the critics to conventional IR theories that emerge in the context of the third debate.

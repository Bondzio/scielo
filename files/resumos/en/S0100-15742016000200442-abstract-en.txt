Over the past few decades, a growing number of Protestant and Adventist communities has defended creationism in Brazil. This article aims to examine the identity matrices of this movement, its transformations over time and the influence of its discourse in society; in particular, in science and biology education. It is suggested that, to deal with this situation, practices that contribute to a better understanding of scientific activity and emphasize the importance of its approach in general education should be applied. This article also highlights the relevance of educational activities capable of promoting an environment of respect for other worldviews and of dealing with the knowledge transmitted by the view of estrangement, upsetting comfort zones.

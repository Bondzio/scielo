The non-speakability of the possible meanings of images such as the queer generates new esthetics in the contemporaneity through its transformation into poetics. The article investigates those new forms of - plastic - subjectivation in its written conception. The tension it faces at the moment of the (trans)cription of the experience produces esthetical pleasures that, at the same time, lead to the accomplishment of other artistic works. We suggest that, in this creative process, the artistic identity is tuned with affections and sexual desire. This work aims at contributing for the field of the visual poetics, as well as for the literature, regarding autobiographic narratives, queer and/or feminist poetics. We want to broaden the methodologies to investigate the arts, articulating the artistic practice with the textual production, where the writer is the artist her/himself. The work is based on the theories of the affections, by Patricia Clough (2004) and a queer perspective, according to Rosa Blanca (2011).

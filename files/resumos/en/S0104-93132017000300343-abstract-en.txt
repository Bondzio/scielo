Abstract This paper analyses a navigation technique widely practiced by raft fishermen in the Northeast of Brazil for locating fishing grounds in the light of the day and keeping the coast in sight. It consists of fixing position by lining up landmarks. Based on the embedded perspective of the fishermen and the motion parallax of landmarks in the environment, such a technique differs from modern Western navigating techniques in a number of ways. Engaging debates on the paradigm of &#8220;mental maps&#8221; and the ecological approach, we highlight the contributions of the functional theory of navigation by Alfred Gell, the theory of &#8220;wayfinding&#8221; by James Gibson and Tim Ingold, among others, in addition to the computational theory of navigation by Edwin Hutchins.

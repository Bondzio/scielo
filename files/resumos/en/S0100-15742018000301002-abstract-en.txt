ABSTRACT Seeking to understand the collective conceptions of masculinity among boys and the possible implications of such conceptions on their school performance, we conducted an ethnographic research with working-class students aged approximately ten years, from a public school in SÃ£o Paulo city, Brazil, using observations and interviews. We identified that being a &#8220;good student&#8221; did not contradict the affirmation of the masculinity of those boys; on the contrary, school engagement was recognized as a positive aspect among them. Nonetheless, to be &#8220;good students&#8221;, boys needed to be able to play in the power relationships between peers, drawing on practices of valued masculinities, and (re)constructing school and social hierarchies in their interactions.

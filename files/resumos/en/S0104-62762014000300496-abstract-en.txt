In this article I review the academic debate generated in the United States from the Huntington's arguments about Hispanic immigration, especially Mexicans, for this country. In his works "The Hispanic challenge" and Who are we?, Huntington argues that for demographic and political reasons Mexican immigrants not assimilate to American culture founded on the core Anglo-Protestant values??, which will divide the United States into two peoples, two cultures and two languages?? Empirical studies that tested here the empirical Huntington's arguments denied them and the critical theorists conceive them doctrinal, because express a settler ideology and manifest conflict theory of cultural pluralism and the internal colonialism.

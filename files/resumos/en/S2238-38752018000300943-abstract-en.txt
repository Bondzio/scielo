Abstract The topic explored in this article is the growth in tourism observed in recent years in the archipelago of Cape Verde, particularly on the island of Boa Vista. My interest is to reflect on the senses of Africanity built in the relationship between Cape Verdeans and European tourists who travel to the archipelago in search of African experiences in a calm, paradisiacal, exotic and tropical environment. These categories, which permeate the brochures, sites and tourism magazines in the archipelago, are analysed as forms of representation and self-representation in the relational context produced by the tourism trip.

By means of a detailed analysis of the concept of empathy (<I>Einf&uuml;hlung</I>),    he shows that Husserl's phenomenology of intersubjectivity offers a triple foundation    of the sciences. As a warrant of the objectivity of the world, it grounds the    natural sciences; as a presupposition of sociality, it founds the social sciences;    as mediated by culture, it grounds the social sciences as human sciences. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords:</b>    social order, empathy, phenomenology, Husserl, Habermas. </font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESUMO</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Partindo de uma    revis&atilde;o de diversas solu&ccedil;&otilde;es propostas para o problema    da ordem social, o autor apresenta uma reconstru&ccedil;&atilde;o n&atilde;o    cr&iacute;tica da fenomenologia transcendental de Edmund Husserl como alternativa    &agrave; teoria da a&ccedil;&atilde;o comunicativa de Habermas. Atrav&eacute;s    da an&aacute;lise detalhada do conceito de empatia (<i>Einf&uuml;hlung</i>),    ele mostra que a fenomenologia da intersubjetividade de Husserl oferece um triplo    fundamento &agrave;s Ci&ecirc;ncias Sociais. Como garantia de objetividade do    mundo, ela a iguala &agrave;s Ci&ecirc;ncias Naturais; como uma pressuposi&ccedil;&atilde;o    de socialidade, ela as fundamenta Ci&ecirc;ncias Sociais, e por serem mediadas    pela cultura, as converte em Ci&ecirc;ncias Humanas. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palavras-chave:</b>    ordem social, empatia, fenomenologia, Husserl e Habermas. </font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>R&Eacute;SUM&Eacute;</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Passant en revue    les diverses solutions propos&eacute;es pour r&eacute;soudre le probl&egrave;me    de l'ordre social, l'auteur propose une reconstruction non critique de la ph&eacute;nom&eacute;nologie    de l'intersubjectivit&eacute; transcendentale de Edmund Husserl comme une approche    qui permet de corriger la th&eacute;orie de l'agir communicationnel de Habermas.    A partir d'une analyse serr&eacute;e de l'empathie (<i>Einf&uuml;hlung</i>),    il montre que l'intersubjectivit&eacute; intervient dans les &eacute;crits de    Husserl d'abord comme fondement des sciences naturelles, car l'intersubjectivit&eacute;    assure l'objectivit&eacute; du monde&#160;; ensuite comme fondement des sciences    sociales, car la socialit&eacute; pr&eacute;ppose l'intersubjectivit&eacute;&#160;;    et, enfin, comme fondement des sciences humaines, car l'intersubjectivit&eacute;    donne acc&egrave;s au monde de la culture. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mots-cl&eacute;s:    </b> ordre social, empathie, ph&eacute;nom&eacute;nologie, Habermas, Husserl.    </font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>Social theory    and the problem of order</B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If philosophy distinguishes    itself from the human sciences by the fact that it is '            without object' (Althusser),    and if we assume that social theory is not just '            social philosophy for failed    philosophers', then we may start to wonder what its object actually is. As an    entry, and a pretext, to the theme of empathy, I would like to suggest that    social theory deals with many objects, including '            hairy ones' (Latour), but    that this plurality can nevertheless be reduced to one deceptively simple question:    '            How is society possible?'<a name="volta1"></a><a href="#nota1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>    As a matter of fact, this problem of social order is always already solved in    everyday life. Even in prisons, favellas, or civil wars, Ego and Alter         are    in principle, if not in practice, able to co-ordinate their actions one way    or another, and thus to avoid the utter chaos of absolute unpredictability.    In this sense, the question of social order serves a merely heuristic function.    It aims to reflexively uncover the conditions of possibility of social life    as such, and correlatively, of the social sciences themselves. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Looking back at    the long history of the social sciences, from Plato to Nato, we can distinguish    two ideal typical solutions to the problem of social order which, broadly speaking,    correspond to the distinction sociologists usually make between theories of    action on the one hand and of systems on the other. Either the actions of Ego    and Alter are co-ordinated in a systemic way, that is they are co-ordinated    through the system, or, alternatively, they are co-ordinated by the actors themselves.<a name="volta2"></a><a href="#nota2"><SUP>2</SUP></a>    In the first case ('            systemic integration'), the co-ordination of the actions    is not intended as such by the actors. It is the unintended result of the interlocking    of the consequences of their action. The co-ordination thus happens, as Marx    says, <I>a tergo</I>, behind the back of the individuals. Following Hal&eacute;vie,    whose history of utilitarianism significantly influenced Talcott Parsons, we    can distinguish two systemic solutions to the problem of social order, namely    the political and the economic one.<a name="volta3"></a><a href="#nota3"><SUP>3</SUP></a>    In the political solution, the problem is solved through the '            artificial identification'    of the individual interests with the general interest through political constraint.    Hobbes' <I>Leviathan</I>, Bentham's <I>Panopticon</I> and Carl Schmitt's advocating    of a strong state can serve as examples of this authoritarian tradition of thought.    In the economic solution, the problem is solved through the '            natural identification'    of interests through economic constraints. Mandeville's <I>Fable of the Bees</I>,    Adam Smith's '            invisible hand' and Hayek's theory of the market as a '            catallaxy'    are examples of this liberal tradition of thought. In his critique of commodity    fetishism, Marx has shown that this solution only represents an economic variant    of Hobbes' <I>Leviathan</I>. The political constraints of the state are merely    replaced by the economic constraints of the pseudo-natural laws of the market.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The problem with    systemic solutions is that they can only conceive of the social order as a constraining    one that is imposed on the actors <I>a tergo</I> and <I>post actum</I>. From    a metatheoretical perspective that analyses the most general presuppositions    of sociology (What kind of action is presupposed? How are social structures    conceived? What is the relation between agency and structure), the problem appears    to be linked to the nature of action that is foregrounded. Action is either    conceived in purposively rational (<I>Zweckrational</I>) or strategic terms.<a name="volta4"></a><a href="#nota4"><SUP>4</SUP></a>    It is only if a non-strategic conception of action is introduced that we can    conceive of a social order that is not imposed from above or without, but is    in line with the intentions of the actors themselves. Thus, we pass from '            systemic'    to '            social integration'. The co-ordination of action is <I>a fronte</I>; it    is intentionally pursued and effectively accomplished by the actors themselves.    It is not imposed on them from without, but is the immanent result of the intentional    interlocking of their mutual perspectives. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Simplifying once    again the history of sociological ideas for didactic purposes, we can distinguish    three '            social' solutions that introduce such '            non-strategic' elements in the    picture.<a name="volta5"></a><a href="#nota5"><SUP>5</SUP></a> </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) In the normative      solution, the problem of order is solved through the internalisation of norms      and values. Durkheim's conception of moral facts, Freud's analysis of the      internalisation of norms and their synthesis in Talcott Parsons' structural      functionalism are examples of this normative tradition of social theorising.      Here the underlying idea is that actions are co-ordinated through the institutionalisation      of norms and values. It is because people share certain institutionalised      values and norms, that the problem of the '            double contingency of action' (Parsons-Luhmann),      is overcome and that the complementarity of expectations can be assured. To      take an example that Parsons has worked out at length in <I>The Social System</I>,      the patient knows how to behave when he goes to the doctor, because he has      internalised the expectations that are associated with the role of the doctor      and the patient. </font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) In the rationalistic      solution, the problem of social order is solved through the constraint of      Reason. Kant's theory of practical reason, George Herbert Mead's conception      of the General Other and Habermas's theory of communicative action serve as      examples of this tradition of the Enlightenment. The interlocking of perspectives      and the co-ordination of actions is here accomplished not so much through      the internalisation of traditional norms and values, as is the case with Parsons,      but by means of a rational and critical discussion of the normative, the cognitive      and the expressive validity claims that are implicit in every speech act and      that can be explicitly thematised in case a spontaneous agreement is not reached      and enacted in practice. This communicative solution improves on the preceding      one in so far as it breaks with the '            traditionalism' of the former and is      thus better suited for highly individualistic societies like ours in which      individuals are increasingly '            set free' (<I>freigesetzt</I>, to quote Beck)      from the constraints of the normative institutions of the past and have to      reflexively cobble together their narrative identity on the basis of a self-chosen      set of values and norms. </font></p>       <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) Although I      tend to agree with Habermas' communicative solution to the problem of social      order and think that it allows us to conceptualise how individuals can live      with anomie without however abandoning the project of individual and collective      autonomy, I would like to try to build a phenomenological storey under his      communicative revision of historical materialism in order to make it more      contextual and concrete and, thus, less formal. A series of '            epistemological      obstacles' have so far prevented a fruitful exchange of ideas between phenomenologists      and critical theorists of the second generation. Instead of seriously dealing      with the phenomenological movement, Habermas and Apel have both written it      off (after a short-lived infatuation with Heidegger) on the grounds that phenomenology      remains hopelessly entrapped in subjectivism and that it can only overcome      its monological bias by taking the '            linguistic turn'.<a name="volta6"></a><a href="#nota6"><SUP>6</SUP></a>      Habermas and Apel may be right, but in this article I would like to explore,      through a reading of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology of intersubjectivity,      how a critical theory of communication could be phenomenologically grounded      in such a way that it would be able to describe in detail how intersubjectivity      is actually established by the actors themselves and, once this is done and      we move up from intersubjectivity to interaction, to analyse how a common      world is progressively constituted through intentional acts of communication.      </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without inquiring    into the prepredicative and prelinguistic bases of linguistic intersubjectivity,    Habermas and Apel take intersubjectivity as given. Instead of taking the '            inter'    of intersubjectivity seriously and analyse how Ego and Alter, each separately,    yet mediated through the bodily presence of the Other, establish the interconnection    of their minds, critical theorists take intersubjectivity for granted and treat    it as the unquestioned stepping stone of their (quasi-)transcendental analyses    of the '            unlimited community of communication' which every speech act allegedly    presupposes as its unquestionable <I>telos</I>. From the standpoint of transcendental    phenomenology, this position is unwarranted or '            unfounded' in so far as the    constitution of the '            community of communication' presupposes that Ego and Alter         are able to constitute each other as Alter Ego's in the first place. Intersubjectivity    is not a given, but the result of a process of intentional constitution by the    actors themselves. Indeed, according to Husserl, one cannot investigate the    realm of social interactions without analysing how the Other is constituted    as an Alter Ego through empathy (<I>Einf&uuml;hlung</I>), that is through the    apperception of the body of the other as a living body. Thanks to this foregrounding    of the living body and of the experience of the flesh, as first analysed by    Husserl and further developed by Merleau-Ponty and Waldenfels, phenomenology    is also able to correct an important oversight in Habermas' theory of communicative    action. In the grand scheme of things of Habermas, there's hardly any place    for bodies and bodily feelings. Given that he does not take into account the    incarnated nature of human action, everything happens as if minds could directly    communicate with each other, without the mediation of the body and without the    intervention of emotions. It is true that Husserl's approach is as cognitivistic    as Habermas's and that we can hardly rely on him to theorise emotions. Yet,    thanks to his insistence on empathy and the emotive connotations that empathy    (<I>Einf&uuml;hlung, Mitgef&uuml;hl</I>) evokes, we can already vaguely sense    that Habermas not only neglects the body, but also the motivational contributions    of moral sentiments to successful and failed attempts at communication. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Bringing some    of this points together, I would like to explore and try to develop a coherent    and systematic account of a fourth solution to the problem of social order,    namely one which insists on empathy and sympathy, conceived as a foundation    both of social life and of the social sciences. In this context, I will analyse    in depth Husserl's phenomenological account of transcendental intersubjectivity,    Max Scheler's theory of sympathy, Adam Smith's theory of moral sentiments and    Erving Goffman's analysis of the interaction order. The horizon of this research    is thus constituted by a social theory of affective action which remains true    to the project of Enlightenment but which no longer accepts its anti-phenomenological    prejudices.<a name="volta7"></a><a href="#nota7"><SUP>7</SUP></a> </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>Enter Husserl</B>    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During his whole    life, Edmund Husserl was only interested in one philosophical issue: The <I>Letztbegr&uuml;ndung</I>,    or the securing of an absolute and ultimate foundation of all possible knowledge.    He was not interested in Sociology as such, and, in fact, it is not even clear    how one could immediately use his analysis of transcendental consciousness for    sociological purposes. And yet, I think that his phenomenological analysis of    intersubjectivity might be of some relevance to the question of the social order.    The following analysis of Husserl's phenomenology of intersubjectivity is only    tentative. As suits a real beginner - and Husserl himself reminds us that in    phenomenology everybody is a "true beginner" (Hua V, 161)<a name="volta8"></a><a href="#nota8"><SUP>8</SUP></a>    - I have decided to avoid any pre-judgements. I'll try to present a "charitable"    reconstruction of Husserl's phenomenology of intersubjectivity and keep my doubts    about the possibility of a transcendental sociology and my critical questions    regarding his egological attempt to overcome solipsism for myself. Reading Husserl    is certainly challenging and rewarding, because his thought is rigorous and    helps us to conceive of the social sciences as human sciences (<I>Geisteswissenschaften</I>),    grounded on non-naturalistic foundations, but it is frustrating at the same    time, because if Husserl is a tremendous analyst, he's unfortunately not that    great when it comes to presenting his own thought in a synthetic and systematic    way. Moreover, he could only think while writing, with the result that he left    us more then 40.000 dense pages, written in stenography, and in which, at the    end, he himself couldn't find his way anymore. Thus, the challenge is to try    to see the wood through the trees - and in phenomenology, what really matters    are the trees. </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>The phenomenological    project and the problem of solipsism</I> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Literally, phenomenology    is the study of phenomena. More precisely, it is a careful and detailed analytic    description of phenomena. A phenomenon is anything that appears or presents    itself reflexively to the stream of consciousness as it is ordinarily experienced    (seen, heard, touched, felt, etc., in actual experience, in memory, in anticipation,    or even as fantasised) by the individual consciousness &#151; e.g. the chair    here, the inkpot on my desk, the blossoming apple-tree in the garden, but also    the memory of the first day of my arrival on the Plano Piloto, my dislike of    my neighbour's dog or my loving fondness of his wife.<a name="volta9"></a><a href="#nota9"><SUP>9</SUP></a>    So, anything which appears in and gives itself reflexively to the stream of    immanent consciousness is a legitimate area of phenomenological analysis, because    phenomenology is nothing else but the careful analytic detailed description    of the essential (eidetic) structures of the experience of phenomena, of the    ways (perception, fantasy, memory, etc.), the modes (actuality, potentiality,    receptivity, spontaneity) and the doxic modifications (negation, neutralisation,    doubt, etc.) in which the things ' themselves' appear to consciousness.<SUP><a name="volta10"></a><a href="#nota10">10</a></SUP>    As such, phenomenology is not a theory, but it is a philosophical method for    analysing how things appear to, and are thus intentionally constituted as, meaningful    objects by consciousness.<a name="volta11"></a><a href="#nota11"><SUP>11</SUP></a>    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phenomenology conceives    of itself as <I>prima philosophia </I>(<I>Erste Philosophie I</I>, Hua VII,    13-14). It wants to be a "rigorous science" (Hua XXV, 3-62) which    founds or grounds knowledge on absolute, primary and indubitable foundations.    Following Descartes' (first and second) <I>Meditations,</I> Husserl finds this    foundation in the apodicticity of the <I>Ego cogito.</I> However, unlike Descartes,    who attributed a mundane status to the Ego and deduced the rest of the world    from it, Husserl withdraws from the mundane to the transcendental sphere of    the pure Ego and conceives of this sphere as his "infinite field of labour"    (Hua XXV, 62). In order to get at this transcendental sphere of pure consciousness,    he proposes the two methodological tricks of the <I>epoch&eacute;</I> and the    phenomenological reduction.<a name="volta12"></a><a href="#nota12"><SUP>12</SUP></a>    To effectuate the <I>epoch&eacute;</I> means '            putting between brackets' (in    the mathematical sense), in this case putting the existence of the world, which    is always naively assumed in the natural attitude, between brackets and taking    it as a pure phenomenon, as a pure correlate of intentional consciousness. The    reduction is always a reduction to..., in this case reduction of transcendence    (the thing out there) to immanence (the thing as <I>cogitatum</I>), to the constituting    activities of the pure Ego. Anyway, by effectuating the <I>epoch&eacute;</I>    we loose the world, so to speak, but we gain access to the infinite realm of    pure consciousness. What remains after the reduction as a "phenomenological    residuum" (<I>Ideen I</I>, 59, 94) is "the world", the world    between brackets, not the world out there, but the world as an object of consciousness,    understood as an intended object of pure constituting consciousness. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "world",    that is the world as perceived or experienced in any other way by me, is only    and has only meaning insofar as it is constituted by me as an object of consciousness.    To that extent Husserl's transcendental idealism is an almost pure form of egology.    Whatever is, is and can only be insofar as it relates to the constituting activities    of my pure Ego. The world is dependent on me in a sense in which I am not dependent    on the world. But if the world is mine, how can I then be sure of its objectivity?    I can only be sure of it if my world is the same as the world of the others.    The objectivity of the world requires and presupposes transcendental intersubjectivity.    In his summary of the <I>Cartesian Meditations,</I> Husserl says as much: "Transcendental    intersubjectivity is the transcendental basis of the constitution of the objective    world, and of the intersubjective value of ideal objectivities" (Hua I,    200). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The passage from    transcendental subjectivity to transcendental intersubjectivity is thus spurred    by the problem of the objectivity of the world. It presupposes that the temptation    of solipsism can be overcome.<a name="volta13"></a><a href="#nota13"><SUP>13</SUP></a>    That Husserl is not a solipsist, and that notwithstanding the fact that he starts    from the "philosophical loneliness" of the transcendental Ego (<I>Krisis</I>,    Hua VI, 188), he can account for the existence of Other Ego's; even more, that    there's an internal progression in his thought from a transcendental egology    to a transcendental sociology or, more precisely, to a "sociological transcendental    philosophy" (Hua IX, 539; Hua XI, 220), that is what I want to show in the following    analysis of Husserl's phenomenology of transcendental intersubjectivity.<a href="#nota14"><a name="volta14"></a></a><a href="#nota14"><SUP>14</SUP></a>    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Transcendental    intersubjectivity and empathy</I> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But first, what    is transcendental intersubjectivity? Because of its misleading connotations,    it should be stressed from the outset that it does not point to a constituting    collectivity (a ' transcendental We'), but to the way in which the transcendental    Ego has access to the constituting activities of another transcendental Ego.    The central question of transcendental intersubjectivity is thus: How can an    absolute and transcendental Ego experience or constitute another absolute and    transcendental Ego? How can a constituting consciousness experience another    constituting consciousness? How can I have access to the mind of the Other?<a name="volta15"></a><a href="#nota15"><SUP>15</SUP></a>    According to Husserl, we can have access to other minds through empathy. For    sure, we cannot have direct access to the mind and to the feeling states of    the Other, because if we could, the Other would not be the Other but she would    be identical to me. The problem really consists in gaining access to the mind    of the Other, without reducing the Other Ego to myself. As he says in the <I>Cartesian    Meditations</I>: "If I would have direct access to what essentially belongs    to the Other, then he would just be a moment of my being and, at the end, he    and I would just be one" (Hua I, 139). The Other Ego has to be constituted by    me, but precisely as an <I>Alter Ego</I>, that is as an Ego who is herself a    constituting Ego. Husserl advances a specific way of constituting the Other    which satisfies the criterion of his originality. Following Theodor Lipps, he    calls it empathy (<I>Einf&uuml;hlung</I>).<a name="volta16"></a><a href="#nota16"><SUP>16</SUP></a>    The main assumption is that the states of mind of the Other are really her states    of mind, and not mine, but that I can have indirectly access to them through    the apperception of her body (<I>K&ouml;rper</I>) as a living body (<I>Leib</I>).    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a) Reduction to    the sphere of ownness </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Husserl starts    his analysis of transcendental intersubjectivity in a roundabout way. He transforms    the objection of solipsism into an argument in favour of intersubjectivity.    Within the phenomenological reduction, he proposes another reduction - the reduction    to '            primordiality' or to the '            sphere of ownness'. This reduction is really an    abstraction. Indeed, it summons us to make abstraction of all references to    the consciousness of Others and thus to the existence of Others. What remains    after this reduction is "nature as such", not the nature of the natural    sciences, but so to speak "natural nature", nature which is stripped    of all its value - and meaning - predicates. In this reduced nature, there's    only one body, my body, my living body (<I>Leib</I>). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My living body    is not simply a material thing among other material things. My body is an animated    thing, it is a strange complexion of nature and soul. It is not so much subject    to the laws of nature, as material things are, but it has its own characteristics    (cfr. <I>Ideen II</I>, Hua IV, 143 sq.).<a name="volta17"></a><a href="#nota17"><sup>17</sup></a>    </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) My body is      a sensing body, it is a tactile body. It is not so much a thing I see (after      all, I can't see the back of my own body) as a thing I feel.

It is, as Husserl says, the "zero-point      of reference" from which I perceive all things.

I see the Other as a body, and yet    the Other is not just a material body, but a living body: "The body, the    living body of the other, is the first intersubjective thing" (Hua XIV,    110). This body is a body like mine and is analogous to my body. By an act of    imagination, I put myself in the place of the other. Her body is there where    I was a while ago, but where I am not anymore. It sees what I saw, but given    that it is there, while I am here, I cannot see what it sees. However, given    that her body is analogous to mine, I almost automatically associate the characteristics    of a living body with this material body (the so-called "copulation"    or<I> Paarung</I>, cfr. Hua I, 141-143). The body of the Other appears like    a thing but it is not a thing. And in the same way as signpost points towards    a direction or a word towards its meaning, the body of the Other points towards    her mind. Husserl says that I "apperceive" (or "appresent")    the material body of the Other as a living body. By apperception (or appresentation)    he means to say that I perceive something which I cannot see. The same happens    when I see a house or when I hear a clock ticking. I see only the front of the    house, but I apperceive the back. When I go round the house I can see its back.    I hear only the ticking of a clock, but when I look around I'll find a clock,    and I'll perceive it in its original presence. The same can never happen with    the apperception of the Other. I can never perceive in the original mode what    the Other perceives or feels in the original mode. "<I>Appr&auml;senz"</I>,    says Husserl, is not <I>"Urpr&auml;senz</I>" (<I>Ideen II</I>, Hua    IV, 199). I cannot have the experiences of the Other in the original mode, but    I can somehow vicariously experience them like her. This is exactly what empathy    is about. If I have direct access to myself through experience of my living    body, and through reflection on this experience, I have indirect access to the    Other by means of the apperception of the mind through the perception of his    or her body. It is thus through empathy that I posit the consciousness of the    other. In one of the 1500 pages of the three volumes on the phenomenology of    intersubjectivity, Husserl says that empathy creates "the first real transcendence.    Here a second stream of consciousness is co-given, not as a pure construction    of my stream of consciousness, but as one which is indicated by his body. Here    for the first time consciousness transcends itself" (Hua XIV, 8). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">c) From transcendental    intersubjectivity to the objectivity of the world </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consciousness transcends    itself through empathy when I apperceive the body of the other as a living body.    That means, of course, that I apperceive the other as another human being, as    another constituting Ego, in brief as an Alter Ego. And as I apperceive the    Other, I realize that she perceives me. I am aware of that, and as I am aware    of that, I perceive myself as she perceives me. Taking the attitude of the Other,    I objectify myself and, for the first time, I perceive myself as a material    body. "The body of the Other is the first body which I experience as a    physical thing. &#91;...&#93; Only mediately, through the roundabout way of the Other    and possible Others, I learn to experience my own living body as a physical    thing" (Hua XIII, 63). My living body perceives itself as a material body    at the same time as I apperceive your material body as a living body. It now    appears that this double perception of myself both as a living and as a material    body was already presupposed by my apperception of your body as a living body.    Because if I couldn't perceive myself as a material body, I couldn't apperceive    your material body as a living body either. The Czech philosopher Jan Patocka    marvellously summarises this accomplishment by saying that "the experience    of the second person, the realisation of the you, presupposes the experience    of one's self both in the first and the third person".<a name="volta18"></a><a href="#nota18"><SUP>18</SUP></a>    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In any case, when    I perceive you in the second person, I realize that you perceive others too    in the second person, and I recognise that there is a plurality of constituting    transcendental Ego's. When I perceive myself in the third person, I realise    that my body becomes a body among other bodies and the world becomes peopled    by other bodies, which are like my body and which perceive the surrounding world    as I perceive it. Thanks to empathy, I experience the world at least twice:    "Once as experienced directly by me, the other time as experienced empathically,    so to speak through the eyes of the others" (Hua XIV, 315). In this way,    thanks to the Other Ego's, I become an Ego among other Ego's and the objectivity    of the world is secured. Eventually, we rejoin the evidence which we had when    we were in the "natural attitude", but the evidence that there are    Others and that we live in a common world is now clear as an evidence which    is understood: "The transcendent world, the human beings, their relations    with me and with one another as human beings, their experiencing, thinking,    working and creating together is not suspended, devalued or changed by my phenomenological    meditation, but it is only understood ... and so is the communal activity of    phenomenology, which understands itself as the meditative function of transcendental    intersubjectivity" (<I>Formale und transzendentale Logik</I>, Hua XVII,    282). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">d) From transcendental    intersubjectivity to society </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given that phenomenology    finishes where the objectivating sciences begin (Hua II, 58), Sociology takes    off when and where the phenomenological account of transcendental intersubjectivity    comes to its term. In principle, with the interconnection of minds, the co-ordination    of actions that founds society, or as Simmel would say, that <I>is</I> society,    has become a real possibility. With empathy, intersubjectivity is established,    but intersubjectivity is not social interaction.<a name="volta19"></a><a href="#nota19"><sup>19</sup></a>    We know that we are not alone in the world and that we share a common life-world.    But intersubjectivity as such is only a precondition of social life.<a name="volta20"></a><a href="#nota20"><SUP>20</SUP></a>    When I know that the Other apperceives me as a concrete human being, when she    knows that I know and knows that I know that she knows, we are both aware of    our mental interconnection. We are in spiritual contact, as Husserl says. But    it is only when I address myself to you, when we enter into actual communication    with one another that my actions can motivate your actions and yours mine, and    that the higher unity of consciousness which constitutes the essence of social    life is established. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Husserl,    the elementary act of social life is communication. "Sociability constitutes    itself through the specifically social, that is through communicative acts (Hua    IV, 194). &#91;&#133;&#93; Communicative acts are acts that are addressed to the Other,    in which the Other is conscious as the one to whom I address myself; &#91;acts&#93;    that include in themselves the consciousness that the Other understands what    I say and that he will orient his behaviour to it, that he will reply with similar    actions, and so on. Those are the acts that establish a higher unity of consciousness    between the person and the person and which relate to the thing-world as a common    world of judgement, will and valuations. In so far as the world has this relation,    it has the character of a social world, a world endowed with spiritual meaning"    (Hua XIII, 98). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Communication thus    presupposes empathy, but it differs from empathy, on the one hand, because I    can now have direct access to the mind of the other subject and, on the other    hand, because I can act on her, with her, or against her. I have access to her    mind, because the motivations that I impute to the other through empathising    with her, can now be verbally confirmed by her. I can act on her and with her,    because when I talk to her, she can respond to me, and we can come to an agreement    to act together. In so far as Husserl continually stresses the importance of    agreements for the co-ordination of actions, his descriptive sociology seems    compatible with Habermas's theory of communicative action, even more it truly    seems to anticipate it.<sup><a name="volta21"></a><a href="#nota21">21</a></sup>    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interpersonal communication    is the elementary act of social life, and from there onwards we can progressively    build up the larger interconnections of mind which lead from the dyad to the    family, from the family to the community, from the community to the State and,    from there, to intercultural communication among societies and humanity as such.    The logical progression from the dyad to the world-society is only summarily    worked out (cfr. <I>Gemeingeist</I> I and II in Hua XIV, 164-232).<a name="volta22"></a><a href="#nota22"><SUP>22</SUP></a>    From a sociological standpoint, it seems very crude. Notwithstanding the usual    association of phenomenology with individualism, it should be noted that Husserl    adopts a holistic position and conceives of societies as "personalities    of higher order" or "quasi-persons", coming thereby dangerously    close to Durkheim's sociologism and his metaphysics of the social mind. More    interesting is his attempt to found the social sciences on personalistic foundations.    </font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Empathy as a    foundation of and for the human sciences</I> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Empathy is not    only the foundation of social life, it is also the foundation of the human sciences    - the <I>Geisteswissenschaften</I>, as Husserl calls them following Dilthey,    both of whom have been militating against the dominating naturalistic approaches    of their time. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The starting point    is that the method of access to the things has not to be determined by the sciences    and the scientific experts but by the essential nature of the things themselves    and their correlative modes of possible experience (Hua V, 22). Every empirical    science forms a closed domain and its delimitation is <I>a priori</I> determined    by the essence (<I>eidos</I>) of its objects. Husserl talks in that context    about "regional" or "material ontologies" and he claims    that they can be determined <I>a priori</I> by means of a procedure which he    calls "eidetic variation".<a name="volta23"></a><a href="#nota23"><SUP>23</SUP></a>    In the <I>Ideen</I> (II and III) he distinguishes three regional ontologies,    namely material nature, animated nature and the spiritual world. In so far as    they determine the ontological limits of the sciences and stipulate the possible    variations of their objects, those regional ontologies offer the theoretical    foundations of the empirical sciences. Here as elsewhere, the eidetic sciences    that describe the essential and invariant structures of the ontological regions    precede the empirical sciences and found them. As Husserl says repeatedly, "the    science of pure possibilities precedes as such the sciences of realities and    makes them possible as sciences" (Hua I, 106, cfr. also Hua V, 56 and 143).    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Any factual thing    is contingent. It merely represents a possible instance among other possible    instances of a more general essence which predetermines what the thing necessarily    must be when it is to be a thing of a certain kind. We get to the essence of    the factual thing if, by a process of imaginative variation, we arrive at a    categorical determination of what makes that thing a thing of a given kind and    in the absence of which it would no longer be a thing of that kind. We start,    for instance, with the actual experience of a material thing, let's say a lump    of gold. By an act of free imagination, I bring it into motion, I vary first    its seize and then its colour, I change its composition and it turns into bronze    or copper, now I fantasise it as a statue, then I fantasise it as a bike. Whatever    variations I imagine, the thing remains a material thing, which means in that    case that it has a spatial extension, that is subject to the laws of nature,    and that I can subdivide it in the parts of which it is made up. But I cannot    imagine that it starts dancing, because it belongs to the nature of a material    thing that it doesn't move by itself, that it is not animated by a soul. Living    bodies move by themselves, they are animated, they are incarnated souls. They    belong to another regional ontology. It is a fundamental rule of eidetic analysis    that "a fundamental concept of one region cannot be transformed by variation    in another one" (EU, 435). Thus, the concepts of the region of the animated    nature can not be reduced to those of material nature. The region of the animated    body is at the intersection of the region of the material nature and the one    of the spiritual world. It is dependent on a material substrate, but as living    body, as a movable and willing body, it receives its impulses from the spiritual    world. The passage from the region of the soul to the region of the spirit,    which is build upon the former, is fluid, at least compared with the passage    from the region of the thing to the region of the incarnated soul. In the spiritual    world, we do not so much confront bodies as we encounter persons who express    themselves and who encounter other persons and cultural objects in their environment.    Persons are not subject to the causality of natural laws but to the causality    of motivation (<I>Ideen II</I>, Hua IV, 172-208), and they are only motivated    by things of which they are conscious. The things, the other persons, the culture    and the social structures work on them, but only in the sense that they motivate    the person to do something or to refrain from doing so. In order to understand    what motivates a person, we have to understand him or her, and that is only    possible through an act of empathy, by which we interpret his or her behaviour    as a spiritual expression, that is as an expressive embodiment of their person    which is mediated by their culture. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The point I want    to stress here is that empathy is the key to the spiritual world. Through empathy    we encounter the other as a person, as a human being, and not as a thing. In    our everyday life, we spontaneously adopt what Husserl calls the "personalistic    attitude" (Ideen II, <I>Hua IV</I>, 180 sq., <I>Krisis</I>, Hua VI, 294    sq.) When we live with each other, talk to each other and even when we quarrel    with each other, we naturally apperceive each other as human beings. We spontaneously    empathise when we try to understand each other. Even the things we encounter    in our life-world, the houses, the cars, the gardens, the statues are not simply    seen as things, but as practical or aesthetic things. The personalistic attitude    is the natural attitude, the "naturalistic attitude" which reifies    our environment is not natural, but it involves an artificial abstraction from    the spiritual layer and a forceful reduction to its material substrate. In this    sense, the personalistic attitude is primary. The naturalistic prejudice, which    systematically reduces the regions of the soul and the spirit to the region    of the material thing, must fall. Human beings are not just machines subject    to the laws of nature. They act spontaneously and they endow their world with    meaning. It is only when we adopt the personalistic attitude that we can understand    their motivations and that we can have access to the spiritual world. The social    sciences are human sciences. As such they rest on and presuppose empathy. Yet,    it is not because empathy is a necessary and constitutive ingredient of the    human sciences that the human sciences can be mere empathic sciences.<a name="volta24"></a><a href="#nota24"><SUP>24</SUP></a>    </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>Notas</B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="nota1"></a><a href="#volta1">1</a>    The neo-Kantian formulation comes from Simmel, (1992, p. 42-61).

I humbly confess that I no longer    believe in the possibility of a transcendental sociology and that I have serious    doubts about empathy. In this text, which I offer to the reader as a piece of    '            documentary evidence' of my youthful enthusiasm for phenomenology, I reconstruct    Husserl's phenomenology of intersubjectivity without too much critique. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="nota8"></a><a href="#volta8">8</a>    Apart from the references to <I>Erfahrung und Urteil</I> (abridged as EU), published    by Felix Meiner Verlag, Hamburg, 1985 and the <I>Logische Untersuchungen</I>    (abridged as LU I-III), republished in the 1980's by Max Niemeyer Verlag, T&uuml;bingen,    all references are to the Husserliana (abridged as Hua), that is to the 36 volumes    of Husserl's <I>Gesammelte Werke </I>which have appeared so far.

Although the reflexive nature of phenomenology is already clearly announced    in the <I>Logische Untersuchungen</I> (LU II/1, <I>Einleitung</I>), it is most    clearly worked out in <I>Ph&auml;nomenologische Psychologie</I>, Hua IX, &#167;&#167;    28 sq. Moreover, one should also notice that Husserl's phenomenology is a transcendental    phenomenology, that is a phenomenology which suspends the natural attitude of    everyday life in order to analyse the a priori connection between thought and    the thought object, thus in order to analyse how thought intentionally constitutes    the object of thought, regardless of the ontological status of this object.    The turn from a purely descriptive to a transcendental phenomenology is first    accomplished in 1907 in the <I>Ideen zu einer reine Ph&auml;nomenologie</I>    (Hua II) and most clearly exposed in the the first volume of the <I>Ideen I</I>    (Hua II) and the <I>Cartesian Meditations</I> (Hua I).

It is an eidetic    science that attempts to uncover a priori the essential "eternal"    structures of all possible experiences of all possible worlds.

By speaking of intentionality, Husserl is following,    and at the same time amending, Brentano's theory of the "intentional in-existence"    of the object according to which consciousness is always consciousness of...    The implication of intentionality is that each cogitatio has two sides: the    cogito or noesis, i.e. the act of experiencing, perceiving, feeling, etc., and    the cogitatum or noema, i.e. the experienced, perceived, felt object.

It should, however, be noticed    that this turn, which Husserl presents as the most important breakthrough in    the history of philosophy, can be accomplished in three ways. On the Cartesian    way, which I follow here, the way through intentional psychology, and the way    through the ontology of life-world, cfr. Boehm, R.: "Einleitung des Herausgebers",    in Erste Philosophie, Zweiter Teil, Hua VIII, p.

It results from the fact that    one does not have sensory contact with other minds. Since persons comprise a    union of body and mind, the natural place to look for sensory evidence of other    minds is other bodies. Knowledge of other bodies does derive from the senses.    But statements about other minds cannot be validly inferred from claims about    other bodies - or can they? </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="nota16"></a><a href="#volta16">16</a>    In what follows, I assume but do not demonstrate the presence of an ontological    moment in Husserl's analysis of transcendental intersubjectivity. The Other    is the Other and his or her Alterity is safeguarded through empathy; his or    her Alterity is thus not reduced to the monadic life of the Ego, thus to Ipseity,    but precisely maintained as Alterity. For a useful analysis of Husserl's analysis    of intersubjectivity that anticipates his later arguments on Identity and Ipseity    and criticises Husserl's tendency to reduce the non-identity of the Other to    the identity of the Self, see Ricoeur (1993, p. 75-109). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="nota17"></a><a href="#volta17">17</a>    With some exaggeration, we could say that the whole philosophy of Merleau-Ponty,    from his phenomenology of perception to his later thoughts on the chiasmus (but    with the exception of his more political writings), is already contained in    Husserl's <I>Ideen II</I>. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="nota18"></a><a href="#volta18">18</a>    Patocka (1988, p. 120; 1992, p. 199). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="nota19"></a><a href="#volta19">19</a>    Whether Husserl reduces sociality to intersubjectivity remains a moot point.

According to Sch&uuml;tz (1951), the concept of "transcendental we"    is a kind of <I>contradictio in terminis</I> (a <I>singulare tantum</I>, as    he says), because the transcendental stand necessarily implies a monadic one.    From the mutual immanence of consciousness of Ego and Alter Ego, one cannot    simply pass to their mutual interaction, as this involves a passage from a transcendental    to a mundane sociology. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="nota21"></a><a href="#volta21">21</a>    The only difference, of course, is that for Habermas interaction is primary,    whereas for Husserl it is secundary, even to the point that one may really question    whether a Monadic Sociology is possible in the first place. Once we have moved    from the transcendental to the mundane level of analysis, however, the disagreement    comes to a halt and we may regret that Habermas has not drawn on Husserl as    much as Husserl has on Dilthey, who thought him that an individual psychology    is really "nonsense" (Hua XIII, p. 472).

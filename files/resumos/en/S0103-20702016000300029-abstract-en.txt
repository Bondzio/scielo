Abstract In 1910, one of the philosophers from Mexican Ateneo de la Juventud (1909-1912), José Vasconcelos (1882-1959), joined the Francisco I. Madero&#8217;s presidential campaign, whilst the other one, Antonio Caso (1883-1946), gave his support to Porfirio Diaz&#8217;s seventh reelection. Thirty years after, in 1940 and in the context of World War II, one of the former ateneísta backed up the German Nazis, and the other took the side of Western democracies, particularly the British one. But now Vasconcelos was the first and Antonio Caso the second. Their roles have been fully inverted.

Abstract This article aims to discuss about the approximations and distances between two fundamental figures of the State processes, the victims and their executioners. Structured by two distinct ethnographic moments, the moment of the interview with Rosa, a Human Rights activist and Gabriel&#8217;s mother, a boy whose murder would have been motivated by homophobia, and the moment of the jury trial session that took the two defendants for Gabriel&#8217;s death to condemnation, this text brings as subjects the &#8220;constitutive reciprocities&#8221; among genre relations, sexuality, class, racialization, generation etc. that compose victims and executioners&#8217; narratives and very close experiences and make them all primary targets for the wider processes of criminalization and violence. Considering yet the importance of the notions of crime and violence to the contexture of the Statal forms of intelligibility, this text also approaches the crimes&#8217; place inside those constitutive reciprocities, distinguishing it from the core objects of the fights Rosa is implicated in, and the violence comprehended then as the overmeasured, the inadmissible narrative that contradictorily composes the possibility of recognition of the victims, Rosas&#8217;s boy.

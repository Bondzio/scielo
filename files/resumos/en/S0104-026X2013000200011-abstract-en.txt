Ártemis - a journal on Gender, Feminist and Sexuality Studies was invited to present its historical and political background in an event entitled "REF 20 Anos: militância e academia nas publicações feministas" (REF twenty years: militancy and academy in feminist publication). The event took place in November 2012, in Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. The presentation on the Journal's history was included in the round table "Desafios das publicações no campo feminista", that is, "Challenges in the field of feminist publication", together with editors from Cadernos Pagu, Cadernos de Crítica Feminista da ONG SOS Corpo, Revista Gênero (UFF) e ONG CFEMEA. Our presentation brought to light the existing relation between academic journals and social movements, as well as discussions on the editorial profile of our journal, our future objectives, difficulty faced as well as strategies of survival along the eight years of Artemis' existence.

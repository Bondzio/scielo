Firstly, it examines the connections between literary genre and gender and between feminism and autobiography. Secondly, it considers the emergence of the self in the genres of intimacy and contends with the idea of the intimacy by making use of psychoanalytic theories. Subsequently, it analyzes both writers comparatively by considering the concept of the literature of the periphery. It also examines the bond between literary oeuvre and the intimacy exhibited in them. Finally, it judges the images of womanhood and of the feminine community in their intimate writings.

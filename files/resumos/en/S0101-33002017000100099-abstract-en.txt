ABSTRACT The economic and geopolitical shifts of recent years have forced the oecd-dac member countries to offer greater recognition to the development cooperation activities of the BRICS and other rising powers, who claim to follow a different logic from the coercive policy transfer models associ ated with North-South development cooperation. At the same time, there has been rapid growth in international &#8220;mutual learning&#8221; outside the formal framework of development cooperation. This paper explores the implications of this for international policy diffusion in the age of &#8220;universal&#8221; development envisaged by the UN&#8217;s Agenda 2030.

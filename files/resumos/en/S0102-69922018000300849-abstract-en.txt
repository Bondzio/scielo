Abstract The article aims to analyze the political behavior of young voters before the municipal election of 2016 in Brazil, based on a questionnaire applied with 1,221 subjects, after the second round of elections. The questionnaire includes aspects such as: (a) what motivates / discourages young people to vote for mayor and councilor; (b) what are the qualities of the candidates who are most valued by them; (c) why they vote blank or void; (d) their behavior during the election campaign; (e) the topics of greatest interest during the electoral debate; (f) the sources of political information most frequently used by informants. Among the results, a paradox stands out: young people express dissatisfaction with politics and therefore vote blank or blank as a protest, but the data reveal motivations that are in the traditional sphere, such as voting in candidates from families who already in local politics.

Abstract The text debates the social configurations that go beyond borders and gain shape at a transnational scenario, linked to multiple geographies and to dense networks of fluxes. The main purpose is to understand how several expressions of contemporary social life are based on dispersion and kinetic, constituting themselves between multiple scales and locations, through a complex set of transits and links. At the same time is given due attention to the political economy of global mobilities, seeking to make clear that, despite a certain systemic fluidity, the richest countries, through its borders, establish the rhythm, volume and composition of the flows arising from their international connections.

Summary: The goal of this work is to analyse to what extent the images of women arisen during Spanish Second Republic and Civil War influenced feminist discourses in Chile during 1930s. Three Chilean feminist papers are analysed: Nosotras (Valparaíso 1931-1935); Acción Femenina (Santiago 1922-1939) and La Mujer Nueva (Santiago 1935-1942). Discourse analysis is used to work on texts that have emerged in a context of political radicalization. The defense of the Spanish Republic became an element that contributed to the consolidation of the Latin American - specifically Chilean - feminist discourse, reinforcing a new feminine subjectivity represented by the "new woman".

This article contextualizes the trajectory and the obstacles faced by Brazilian trans teachers during their process of schooling and insertion in teaching. Their reports, analyzed by post-critical theories, mostly the queer theory, elucidate their school lives through processes of constant resistance and struggle since Basic Education, passing through Superior Education and remaining in teaching. In this sense, the speech of these teachers allows the emersion of "signs of fissures in heteronormativity", confirming that, despite its hegemonic role as a reproductive and maintainer of gender and sexuality norms, the school is one of the possible spaces to the effectiveness of one's right to constitute him/herself as a human.

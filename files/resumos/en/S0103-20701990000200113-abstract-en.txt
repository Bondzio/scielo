This paper attempts to clarify the political participation of Brazilian women in the sixties and the beginning of the seventies. Their struggle took diferent ways, for or against the military dictatorship. The paper presents data about women's integration in left wing groups, specially in urban guerrilla. Many women have taken place of these groups, mainly young graduates and students, though there were many more men involved with armed struggle against the military government. Women's militancy in guerrilla organizations has not been properly feminist, but it meant a step towards women's liberation, particularly if compared with organized militancy of right wing women, who supported the military government, defending their traditional status of ives, mothers and housewives'.

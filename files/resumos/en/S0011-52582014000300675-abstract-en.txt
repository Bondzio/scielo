This article analyzes the transformations of residential segregation in the SÃ£o Paulo metropolitan region in the 2000s. The paper departs from information on social classes generated from the EGP occupational classification in order to test current hypotheses concerning the recent transformations of classes and spaces. The data show that the metropolis continues intensely segregated and structured around a clear avoidance pattern between the social groups positioned at the extremes of social structure. However, although the changes of 2000s brought greater exclusivity for the areas inhabited by the elites, they also tended to increase heterogeneity in the rest of the city, contributing to greater social mix in intermediary spaces and at the peripheries.

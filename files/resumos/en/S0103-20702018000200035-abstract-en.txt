Abstract This essay introduces some key notions from the &#8220;mobility turn&#8221; to understand and define the experience of urban mobility from a critical reading of urban and transport studies as well as social sciences, in general, and particularly in Latin America. It states that cities are spaces of circulation and stresses the importance of circulation to the production of urban space. The social modern theory tradition has fuelled the idea that transit spaces are non-places, yet human movements within the city are ways of dwelling and, thus, mobilities are social and meaningful practices. Finally, urban mobility experience is characterized through examples like automobility.

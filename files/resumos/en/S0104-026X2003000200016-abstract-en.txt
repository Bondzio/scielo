Insertion in World Social Forum takes part of the incidence strategy that Marcosur Feminist Articulation has adopted in order to answer this question. And election of subject matter and style of the campaign "Your mouth, fundamental against fundamentalisms", is a way to respond to the one that says: "who wants gender, when one can have sex?"

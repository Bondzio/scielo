This article aims to propose a reflection on conjugality in its relationship with parenting, extended family and ex-husbands in a recomposed female homoparental family, from the periphery of SÃ£o Paulo. Possible variables that influence the manner in which lesbianism is dealt with and experienced will be analyzed, as well as how different positions relating to this question can result in distinct family arrangements. In the case studied the experience of political activism and the conception of lesbianism as a "condition" result in a form of publicity, which has repercussions in the configuration of the family. Finally, beginning with a contemplation of the ethnographic data, the very concept of lesbianism and plural parenting will be reconsidered.

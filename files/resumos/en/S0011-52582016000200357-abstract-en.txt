ABSTRACT This article examines the extent to which education can be considered one of the main determinants of wealth in Brazil. Using date pertaining to the specific university education from the 2010 Census Sample, it focuses on the 1% richest within the distribution of income. The main conclusion is that education may be important in explaining total inequality, but there is no evidence that mass education is one of the most relevant factors in explaining the differences between the rich and the rest of the Brazilian population. Not even elite education can be considered a main determinant of the current levels of wealth. Therefore a significant portion of total inequality cannot be reduced by educational policy.

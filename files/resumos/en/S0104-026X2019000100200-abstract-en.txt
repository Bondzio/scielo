Abstract: This text discusses the theme of care workers for the elderly who have their services intermediated by a care enterprise. The text is based on a case study in Rio de Janeiro. These women&#8217;s work is analyzed through the tension between two logics: one that sees care shaped by values associated with reciprocity and solidarity, perceived as feminine, and another marked by the necessity of professionalization and emotion&#8217;s management. The research&#8217;s results suggest that both logics - the reciprocity one and the market one - compete in the production of care work&#8217;s moral and emotional demands, and that some care workers operate strategies of detachment from the family model of care as a way to value their own work.

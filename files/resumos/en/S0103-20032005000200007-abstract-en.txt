The main objective of this study was to establish the importance and the enchainment of the production sector and butchery/making up sector of pork chain in Minas Gerais, in the years of 1980 and 1995, applying the Rasmussen-Hirschman index, the influence field index and GHS index. The results showed that both sectors were considered key sectors only by the Rasmussen-Hirschman index and the influence field index, i.e., they presented greater importance when observed its impacts on the final demand and its power of enchainment in the economy. Despite not being considered key sectors by the GHS index, they presented great potential of backward impacts. This result, and the fact that the participation of these sectors had been increasing in the Minas Gerais economy since 1995, suggests that those sectors the state policy makers need to give priority in resources allocation and in the strategy for the industrial development.

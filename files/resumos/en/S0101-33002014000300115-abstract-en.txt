This article investigates the abolition of slavery in Brazil from a political sociology approach. On one hand, it takes the phenomenon as part of dynamics encompassing political institutions, public space and grassroots, arenas in which happened the conflict movement, state and pro-slavery countermovement. On the other hand, it places the movement as part of the contemporary international scene, showing how Brazilian activists learned and borrowed from the international abolitionism repertoire. The aim is to show how modern the national abolitionist movement was and its impacts on the political process of abolition of slavery in Brazil.

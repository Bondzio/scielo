Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient    to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food    production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in    a sustainable manner.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Article 3</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Principles</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In their actions to achieve the objective    of the Convention and to implement its provisions, the Parties    shall be guided, <i>inter alia, </i>by the following:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The Parties should protect the climate    system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the    basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities    and respective capabilities.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. The Parties should take precautionary    measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change and    mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible    damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for    postponing such measures, taking into account that policies and measures to    deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits    at the lowest possible cost. To achieve this, such policies and measures should    take into account different socio-economic contexts, be comprehensive, cover    all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and adaptation,    and comprise all economic sectors. Efforts to address climate change may be    carried out cooperatively by interested Parties.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. The Parties have a right to, and    should, promote sustainable development. Policies and measures to protect the    climate system against human-induced change should be appropriate for the specific    conditions of each Party and should be integrated with national development    programmes, taking into account that economic development is essential for adopting    measures to address climate change.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. The Parties    should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system    that would lead to sustainable economic growth and development in all Parties,    particularly developing country Parties, thus enabling them better to address    the problems of climate change. Measures taken to combat climate change, including    unilateral ones, should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable    discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Article 4</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Commitments</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.

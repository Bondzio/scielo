Abstract This article is based on the ethnography of Pope Francis&#8217; visit to the National Shrine of Our Lady Aparecida and it aims to explore the urban landscape configuration of the city of Aparecida/Brazil. Thus, on one hand, it intends to demonstrate how the relations between religious power and political power are manifested in that municipality and on the other hand, to unveil how the simultaneity of these distinct powers coordinates the urban landscape at the Brazilian Capital of the Faith.

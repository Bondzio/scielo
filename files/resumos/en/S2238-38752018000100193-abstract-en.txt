Abstract This research approaches the contemporary social movements and the emergence of new political subjects. Specifically, it explores the multiple political belongings of activists and their circulation in order to understand the so-called &#8216;hyphenation&#8217; of feminisms. Based in major Brazilian cities, this research was undertaken among an informal network of young activists who self-identify as feminists. These are women in their twenties and thirties, from middle-class backgrounds, who have gone to college. They deploy diverse references like vegetarianism/veganism, punk, autonomism and anarchism, making connections with diverse political agendas that extend beyond gender. Adopting an ethnographic approach, the article looks to analyse how these relations are embodied in their iconography of the network&#8217;s fanzines, flyers and books.

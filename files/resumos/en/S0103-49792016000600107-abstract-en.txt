Although it is considered to be a priority area of cooperation, the South American energy regionalism shows signs of stalling, evidenced by fruitless negotiations for a South American Energy Treaty. This article explains the paradox that, despite the political will, favorable structural conditions for integration and the creation of ad hoc regional institutions, energy regionalism failed to implement intergovernmental statements on policies. It argues that none of the established institutions have been able to mediate the dispute between markets and between the preferences of governments. Therefore, a new consensus is necessary to reconsider the need and the ability of the region to advance the energy integration agenda. More generally, the energy sector gives important lessons regarding the future challenges that the regional cooperation will face in public policies in South America.

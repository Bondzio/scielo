The objective of this paper is to show the existence of different worlds of welfare in Brazil. We suggest that as the existence of distinct worlds of welfare across Brazilian states as a fundamental change in welfare after the 1988 Constitution. The conclusion is the discrepancy between the worlds of welfare found between states allows us to say that in Brazil there are distinct categories of citizens, with differentiated access to basic services. We also show that states have different legacies and therefore different trajectories in the three decades analyzed, but there is a trend towards convergence in welfare. This heterogeneity is reflected in distinct patterns of social welfare. For this, the methodology used was basically a descriptive analysis based in time series and cluster analyses.

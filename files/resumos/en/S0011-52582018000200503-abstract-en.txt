ABSTRACT The article analyzes the profile and proposals of the Brazilian political parties that defend radical environmentalism or ecosocialism. The programs of the 35 parties registered in the Electoral Court were analized in order to identify the ecological profile of each one. From this global analysis, eight parties were identified as ecosocialists whose common characteristic is the critique of capitalism and liberal environmentalism. The theoretical framework brings together contributions from the sociology of political parties and environmental sociology. The conclusions show two profiles of ecosocialist parties: the radicals opposed to the capitalist industrial system; and the moderates, identified as systemic ecologists (two parties). In the first case there are six captions: PCdoB, PDT, PSOL, PCO, PSTU and PCB. In the second group are: PV and PEN. For all of them, however, the State plays a central role as the insurer of socialist environmental policies.

By reclaiming failure, inadequacy, marginality and negativity as distinctive characteristics of queer projects and queer subjective constructions, this essay suggests that there is a marginal lesbian/trans imaginary being formulated within the counter-artistic Brazilian projects entitled "Pegadinha Les-Bi-Trans", "Sapatoons Queerdrinhos" and "Eu vejo l&#233;sbicas em todos os lugares". By analyzing the subversive potentials imposed by negative and post-identity based auto-representative strategies employed within autonomous projects located in the borders of the authorized institutions of knowledge production (such as the art systems), I analyze the creation of a translesbianizing gaze, which is able to destabilize heterocapitalistic rhetorics and visualities.

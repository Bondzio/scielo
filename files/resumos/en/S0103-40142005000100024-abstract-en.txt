THE ARTICLE points out that Celso Furtado, in A economia colonial do Brasil nos séculos XVI e XVII, makes use of some of the most influential interpretations of Brazil. If citations are not common in Formação econômica do Brasil and his other books, the same does not happen with his PhD thesis. Hence, the possibility of exploring the implicit dialogue between Furtado and Brazilian social thought can be open.

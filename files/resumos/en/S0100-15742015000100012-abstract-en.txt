This article discusses different dimensions of the educational process for students with multiple disabilities enrolled in specialized educational services - SES - offered in two multi-functional features, at a school located in Baixada Fluminense, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 2013. Four non-verbal students with multiple disabilities and two SES teachers participated in the investigation. The methodology employed was the perspective of action-research, as well as data collection procedures, including participant observation and semi-structured interviews. The theoretical basis followed Vygotsky's cultural-historical approach. The results showed, among other things, the importance of action-research in teachers' continuing education. Likewise, these results also indicate the possibilities for development of higher psychological processes in students with these disabilities based technology pedagogic interventions with use of alternative communication and assistive technology resources.

This paper analyses the interconnection between gender inequalities and time use, putting this analysis under the theoretic perspective of the time use surveys development and observing how it is reflected on the indicators of the Race and Gender Inequalities Picture. At first, time use surveys are characterized, and some of their history and current stage are recovered. The theoretic perspective that focuses on gender as a central category for the analysis of time use is also discussed. Some of the main results found by international time use surveys are presented, with an emphasis on the time use indicators elaborated on the basis of the Brazilian National Household Survey. Finally, it is suggested that time use surveys may contribute to foster public policies designed to attack gender inequalities

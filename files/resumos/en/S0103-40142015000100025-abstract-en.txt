This text was originally built as part of my PhD dissertation. The goal is to discuss alternatives interpretations to rethink about the emergence of large populations in Ancient Amazonia. The reasons that lead native populations to go to war over territories. The causes of populational decline observed in the archaeological record after one 1000 years A.D. The formation process of Dark Earth in archaeological sites. And mainly to present a different ideia from the standard view of sociopolitical complexity related to one crop farming. To present this ideia we will use archaeological data collected mainly in the Iranduba region and the lower Madeira River, both in the State of Amazonas, Brazil.

Abstract Horrific reports of human trafficking and smuggling from the Dominican Republic into Puerto Rico have captured media attention over the past twenty years. Based on interviews with government and non-government officials in Puerto Rico this essay examines the indiscernibility of Dominican concerns in the island. I contend that in conjunction with their omnipresence in intimate, frequently sexualized spaces of labor (bars, cafes, domestic/care giving spaces) Dominican women are invisible subjects who are not regarded as vulnerable and worthy of social protection and support. The racialization of Dominican women within a xenophobic context, their sexualized labor trajectory, and the framework for understanding human trafficking at the international and national level makes them an invisible and illegible population unlikely to receive any state-level or civil society attention or social assistance.

Abstract: Based on interviews conducted with international students at the University of California Davis, the article converses with multiple possibilities of Chinese transnationalities. First, it narrates the trajectories of three students who come from different localities in the People&#8217;s Republic of China, go through the capital Beijing, and arrive at the West Coast of the United States. The aim is to point at the importance of educational trajectories in the configuration of possible transnationalizations in a context where China is increasingly present as a propelling force in shaping global configurations on social, political and economic levels.

Abstract Despite the diversity of subjects and formal solutions, the poems of A rosa do povo, by Carlos Drummond de Andrade, are brought together under the theme of war. In this context, our attention is drawn by the sequence, in the order of work, between the poems "Res√≠duo" and "Caso do vestido," which, apart from being antagonistic in formal terms, seem to depart from the central subject. However, despite the differences, we can observe that both have in common the theme of memory and the crisis of the narrative. This study aims to analyze the relationship between memory and the loss of the ability to narrate under the backdrop of war hinged to the specificities of the local context.

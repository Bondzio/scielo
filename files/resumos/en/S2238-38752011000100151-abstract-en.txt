Abstract: This article examines, in a comparative perspective, aspects of the social construction of care work, in particular its thin boundaries with domestic labor. It focus on three socio-cultural realities, those of France, Japan and Brazil, now challenged by the aging of their populations and the increasing importance of those occupations related to the provision of care for elderly and dependent people. "Auxiliaires de vie", "helpers" or "cuidadoras" share features, most notable the fact they are women. But they also differ (I) on the characteristics of their labor markets and occupational trajectories, (II) on the family structures and actors mobilized in care provision and (III) on skill requirements and public policies related to care. The article encompasses three main sessions focusing these aspects, preceded by a brief conceptual revision dealing with the inflections of care in the analytic discourse and native language.

Love</b></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The relationship    between shifts in the world market and ideas on economic development in Latin    America contrasted sharply with that in Romania before the First World War.    In the latter country, market failure, social upheaval, and access to the continuing    Russian debate led to new theoretical responses, in both Marxist and non-Marxist    discourses; in Latin America, the perceived success of the export-driven economies,    combined with institutional factors and the absence or feebleness of certain    critical traditions known in Romania, resulted in a prolonged inability to mount    a theoretical attack on the "outward-directed development" prescribed    by the Ricardian thesis of comparative advantage. Thus in Latin America, with    which this essay is principally concerned, both Marxist and non-Marxist challenges    to the region's place in the international division of labor were relatively    ineffective before the War's end. Industrial development was well underway in some    countries before government policy pushed in the same direction,    and a theoretical justification of industrializaion came last  even if    it was the first important Third World contribution to development economics.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The essay first    considers the economic experience of four major countries in the region  Argentina,    Brazil, Chile, and Mexico  and then turns to the social situation of the Latin    American intellectuals and their ideological responses in these and other nations    to the shifts wrought within their countries by the international economy. The    larger part of the paper deals with intellectuals and their ideas, and includes    explicit comparisons with Romania, the eastern European country with some important    similarities to, and instructive differences from, Latin America; it was also    the one whose intellectual traditions had a direct impact on Latin America,    through the works of Mihail Manoilescu.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the years from    independence down to the Great Depression, Latin America was subject to three    Kondratieff waves. The first was unfortunately timed, because the London stock    market crash occurred in 1825, just as some Latin American governments were    seeking foreign loans to rebuild their shattered mercantilist economies (Hernández    y Sánchez-Barba, 1971:225). Howerer others, such as Argentina, had already contracted    loans and were now defaulting. In fact, except for the years 1823-24, Spanish    and Portuguese America received very modest amounts of European investment during    the whole first half of the nineteenth century. The period 1825-50, when such    investiment might have occurred, roughly corresponds to the "B" (down-swing)    phase of the Kondratieff wave. For a variety of reasons, of which the lack of    foreign funding was probably second only to political disorder, Latin America    experienced export stagnation and, by implication, little economic growth in    those years (Halperín-Donghi, 1985:304).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chile established    a stable constitutional regime in 1833, and was widely admired in Spanish America    for its stability. Brazil had done so earlier (1824), but only overcame the    fissiparous tendencies of its agrarian elites after 1848. Mexico and Argentina    would not know stable regimes until the 1860's. Many exports that helped make    stable polities possible had their origins in the colonial period, but new ones    developed in the middle decades of the nineteenth century in response to Europe's    industrial and consumer needs.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet it was the    last quarter of the century that witnessed a real transformation of the region's    export economies. The so-called Second Industrial Revolution, associated with    technological change in the production of capital goods and with the application    of science to industry, brought unprecedented investiment, technological innovations    (steamships driven by screw propellers, railroads made of Bessemer steel, refrigeration,    barbed-wire fencing), and above all a huge new demand for capital goods inputs    (e.g., copper, rubber) and consumer goods (sugar, wheat, beef, coffee).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In terms of sheer    growth, the region benefited immensely more from the second Kondratieff cycle,    peaking in 1870-73, than from the first; in fact, Latin America continued to    receive significant amounts of foreign investiment through the long depression    of 1873-96. The area received its largest investiment by decade in the 1880    's, partly as a result of a strong expansion of tropical trade (Mõrner, 1977:459-60).    Yet the region was geared into the European economy at the price of consolidation    of the latifundium and monocultural dependence on the world market (Hernández    y Sanchez-Barbara 1971: 230-31).<a name="not1"></a><a href="#1not"><sup>1</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The transformation    and dynamization of the Latin American economies occurred at different times    in the histories of the national states, depending on the export commodities    involved and the relative success of state-building. Chile was affected by overseas    demands as early as the 1850's (copper exports to Europe, wheat to California), and Argentina and    Brazil followed in the 1860's. But the period 1870-90 provided a much more rapid    ascent. These countries, plus Mexico, now felt the full impact or the combined    effects of the European economic expansion, which, in the Argentine and Brazilian    cases, brought in its train unprecedented levels of European immigration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Argentina is the    best exemplar of these processes; it was created as a nation  in the sense    of having had its national territory definitively brought under a single regime     in the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Formal political unity was    achieved in 1859-61, with the accession of Buenos Aires Province to the Argentine    Federation. But the governance issue was resolved only in the following two    decades, whith the closing of the Indian frontier in Patagonia; the suppression    of the last regional revolt; and the creation of a Federal District, separating    the city of Buenos Aires from the province of the, same name (1880).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Argentina's economic    growth was spectacular. On the average, exports increased 5% a year between    1875 and 1914, both by quantum and by value. From 1.6 milion kilos of wool in    1840, Argentina was exporting 211 milion kilos per annum by the late 1890's    (peak years). Profiting from the invention of refrigerated shipping, Argentina    began to export frozen beef in 1885, sending abroad 328,000 tons in 1914,    in which year chilled beef (a higher-grade commodity not produced in 1885) accounted    for 41,000 tons. Overseas sales of canned meat in the same interval expanded    ten times. Meanwhile wheat exports increased twenty-three times in value from    1880-84 to 1890-94. Transatlantic sales of both wheat and maize rose so rapidly    that they had replaced beef as the chief exports by value on the eve of the    First World War (Glade, 1986: 10-11). In the words of Diaz-Alejandro, "From    1860 to 1930 Argentina grew at a rate that has few parallels in economic history,    perhaps comparable only to the performance during the same period of other countries    of recent settlement" (1970:2).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other countries    were less completely transformed than was Argentina, with the debatable exception    of it small neighbor, Uruguay, but the three others treated here  Brazil, Chile,    and Mexico  were all profoundly affected by the forces we associate with the    Second Industrial Revolution and the Age of Imperialism. Brazil's gross domestic    product, for example, grew at a faster annual rate (2.5%) than did those of    developed countries between 1920 and 1929 (Dean, 1986: 685).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Land tenure patterns    changed in response to international demand, and it is abundantly clear that    estate owners were generally responsive to price signals (see, e.g., Leff, 1982:    II, 43-51; Jacobsen, 1984: 488-89). The first victim of estate-owner's land-hunger    after 1850 was the Catholic Church, controlling as much as a third of the rural    real estate in early nineteenth-century Mexico. One historian has remarked in    this regard that the greatest service of the state to the landowning class was    the forced sale of Church property  though this was much more important in    Mexico than in the other countries considered here (Bauer, 1986: 177). Yet peasants    suffered too. Even in remote Andean villages, peasants began to lose their land    as high prices for sheep and alpaca    wool brought about a diminution of peasant holdings (referring to southern Petu,    facobsen, 1984: 489). Estate owners in Chile began to engross peasant lands    in the 1850's and 1860's (inferred from Bauer &amp; Johnson, 1977: 88-89). In    Argentina, the latifundium arose in the nineteenth century, despite an open    frontier stretching southward by the 1880's to Patagonia; likewise, the rise    of the large plantation in São Paulo, Brazil was a product of the nineteenth,    and even the twentieth, centuries. In Brazil's census of 1920, only 3% of the    rural population owned land, and of that group, 10% owned three-fourths of the    rural property (Dean, 1986: 702). In Mexico, the hacienda had its origins in    the seventeenth century, but the Mexican Revolution of 1910 had as one principal    source the vast and unprecedented alienation of community lands by <i>latifundistas    </i>during the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz (1876-1911). For Spanish America    as a whole, Bauer remarks, the rural population "probably underwent a greater    change &#91;in 1870-1930&#93; than at any previous time ... except for the conquest"    (1986: 185).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Labor systems associated    with the export boom varied widely, but often involved coercive elements. In    the case of Brazil (led by the dynamic province of São Paulo), the coffee economy    bid away thousands of slaves from other provinces in the 1860's and 1870's;    in the 1880's slavery gave way to European immigrant labor based on a unique    mix of wages, free housing, and usufruct. Elsewhere in Brazil the condition    of rural labor was considerably worse. In Argentina, where the "Mesopotamian"    region north of Buenos Aires became one of the world's great wheat granaries,    the land was subdivided and leased to Italian tenant farmers. In the Argentine    case, and to a lesser extent in southern Brazil, there was a low labor-to-land    ratio that resulted in relatively high rural wages.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Chile, a rising    demand for labor in the wheat farming area of the Central Valley coupled with    the expansion of large estates led to a; worsening of the peasant's lot in tenancy    arrangements (<i>inquilinaje</i>) in wheat farming, and to an increasing    proletarianization of the <i>inquilinos </i>and other peasants (Kay, 1980: 76).<a name="not2"></a><a href="#2not"><sup>2</sup></a>    Mexico had perhaps the largest variety of labor systems by the turn of the century,    including illegal but <i>de facto </i>slavery for the Yaqui and Maya Indians,    instances of debt servitude, sharecropping, and in some places rural wage labor    and tenancy (Katz, 1974). Vagrancy laws forced the proletarianization of Indians    and mestizo peasants in Central America and parts of Mexico. In Argentina such    laws were important in remote Tucumán, but also on the pampa, where the vanishing    gaucho encountered similar legislation (Glade, 1986: 37; Slatta, 1983: 106-25).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, Latin American    rural labor systems became much more highly differentiated as a result of the    transformations after 1870. Whereas "parts of Latin America, like eastern    Europe, experienced a sort of second enfeudation with the spread of a capital    market" (Glade, 1986: 38), the immigrant-populated wheat regions of Argentina    and the coffee regions    of Brazil had modern labor and tenancy systems. A great contrast existed between    the rural labor systems of Chile and Argentina, despite their common export    booms in wheat (though the timing and markets were different), and despite Chile's    impressive advance in manufacturinf (see below). In Chile, the population-land    ratio was considerably higher than in Argentina, the latifundist elite probably    more unified, and land rents less differentiated. The lastnamed element was    related to the striking differences between the relative independence of southern    European immigrants (many of whom were literate) in Argentina, and the dependent    <i>inquilinos </i>in Chile, where deference to the landlords was demanded and    rendered. In the view of one student, Chile followed the "Junker route"    to agricultural capitalism in the nineteenth century. Chile's rural society,    it is argured, was close to <i>Gutswirtschaft, </i>while Argentina approximated    <i>Grundherrschaft, </i>with its widespread rural leasing, despite á relative    concentration of rural property ownership (Kay, 1980: 20, 45-46; Laclau, 1969:    300-08).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The nature of the    process of production during and after this period is the subject of much controversy    today; those who denned a feudal" interpretation of the production system    usually have in mind manorialism, which, as Marc Bloch pointed out, antedated    feudalism and survived its demise (1961:I, 279; II, 442). The hacienda of this    period is sometimes seen as poised between two worlds  the inner one of dependency    and even extra-economic coercion of the labor force, and the outer one recognizably    capitalistic in its response to world markets (Pablo Macera, cited in Bartra,    1976: 81).<a name="not3"></a><a href="#3not"><sup>3</sup></a> A similar pattern has been observed in eastern Europe, as we shall    see in the Romanian case.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet Latin America    before 1930, like some regions of eastern Europe, was not simply an exporter    of primary commodities with variegated labor systems. Recent research has established    that manufacturing in Chile, Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil was well established    before the First World War; thus, contrary to received wisdom, the War did nor    create Latin American industry <i>ex nihilo. </i>Rather, it provided the opportunity    for the full use of existing capacity, involving in some plants three shifts    a day, as the hulls of North Atlantic suppliers failed to ply Latin American    waters over a five-year period. Yet the War may have on balance inhibited industrialization    (as opposed to raising industrial output) because of the inability of industrialists    to import capital goods during the conflict. Output and capital investiment    had different rhythms until the late 1930's, when the larger Latin American    countries began to produce capital goods in significant quantities for the first    time.<a name="not4"></a><a href="#4not"><sup>4</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps the most    advanced couintry, in terms of the structural transformation of its economy    in the prewar era, was Chile, where, Palma (1979) has shown, industrial development    was extensive between 1875 and 1900, although the earlier literature emphasizes lost opportunities    for modernization under the regime of a traditional landed oligarchy. True enough,    these were the halcyon years of "outward directed growth," based on    Chile's fabulous nitrate fields, many of them wrested from Bolivia and Peru    in the War of the Pacific (1879-83). In the succeding years the elite introduced    a fiscal system that was heavily dependent on export taxes, and government services    were tailored to the needs of <i>latifundistas </i>and mineral exporters. Nonetheless,    Palma found, import-substitution industrialization  prescribed by the U. N.    Economic Commissign for Latin America after 1949  was already well underway    in Chile by 1914, and was reaching its limits by 1934, much earlier than in    other countries. He also found a correlation between export growth and the growth    of manufacturing before the First World War, but not later. Palma argues for    Chile, as Dean does for Brazil, that export expansion was a precondition of    industrialization (Palma, 1979: 102, 328, 345; Dean, 1969: 3-9). Later than    Romania by five years, Chile was nonetheless the first Latin American country    in which the state extended credits to manufacturers, beginning in 1928. But    more meaningful aid only came after 1939 (see below).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The First World    War caused serious disruptions in the Latin American export economy, and grave    problems followed the War in certain commodity markets, but the export boom    continued in phase with the third Kondratieff wave. A major structural shift    in the postwar era was the growing displacement of Great Britain by the United    States as chief lender and investor. Great Britain exacerbated its problems    in the region by overvaluing the pound through deliberate deflation. In any    case, U. S. advances resulting from the War were evident everywhere. For instance,    the Americans sent 3.5 times as many exports (by value) to Mexico as the British    did in 1913, and the ratio was 10 to 1 by 1927. Great Britain led the United    States in the other three countries considered here in 1913, but by 1927 the    latter had dislodged Great Britain as the leading trading partner in Chile and    Brazil. In Argentina, Great Britain clung to its lead by a single percentage    point (Thorp, 1986: 66).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though Great Britain's    overall capital investiments in the region were still larger in 1929, the U.    S. had far outstripped Great Britain in its postwar lending, both direct and    indirect. Unfortunately for Latin America, U. S. policies were not as well geared    to maintaining the international trading system as Great Britain's had been.    The United States remained highly protectionist, while North American banks    "pressed loans on unwary governments" in Latin America (Thorp, 1986:    61). The problem was insufficient means for repayment, since the U. S. raised    barriers to trade that affected multilateral commerce as well as individual    nations' trade. Argentina especially found itself in straits, since it sought    both American investiment and industrial goods (notably motor vehicles), but    could not sell to the U. S., partly because of lack of complementarity between    the two countries' rural economies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the displacement    of Great Britain was one structural change after the War, another was increasing    commodity export instability. This problem was no less than a disaster in the    case of rubber, which briefly rivaled coffee as Brazil's leading foreign-exchange    earner in the prewar era. Brazil not    only lost its place as the world s leading suppler, but ceased even to be a    <i>consequential </i>supplier between 1912 and 1920, when southeast Asian plantations    went into high gear.<a name="not5"></a><a href="#5not"><sup>5</sup></a>  Another problem  technological innovation     beset the exporters of Chilean nitrates, as a result of ingenuity in the German    chemical industry during the First World War. Violent price fluctuations on    world markets also afflicted Argentine wheat and wool.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The diffusion of    new agricultural technology in the 1920 's  most dramatically the tractor     greatly increased the productive capacity of wheat farms in Argentina and elsewhere    in the world, and thus helped bring down prices. Another agricultural problem    was self-inflicted: Brazil's coffee stockpiling  the valorization program     was promoting ever-greater production of that commodity, whose prices would    collapse in 1929  a few weeks <i>before </i>"Black Thursday "on the    New York Stock Exchange.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On top of these    problems came deteriorating terms of trade after the War. On the average the    terms of trade for all primary products in 1926-29 had significantly dropped    below their levels in 1913 (Thorp, 1986: 62).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The impact of the    Great Depression was severe. Already in 1929, unsold and unsaleable coffee stocks    in Sao Paulo were valued at 10% of Brazil's gross domestic product, and the    situation would worsen over the next four years, as new trees began to produce    (Dean, 1986: 721). In Argentina, the dollar value of exports in 1933 was one-third    the 1929 figure, and Chile's export performance, if anything, was worse. The    depression unseated governments in all three countries. Mexico was spared political    upheaval, perhaps because of the growing consolidation of the revolutionary    regime after the founding of the official party in 1929.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 1930's were    a period of significant structural change for the larger Latin American economies:    Convertibility and the gold standard were abandoned early in the depression    in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. In those countries, the rise in prices    of importables, because of a fall in terms of trade and exchange devaluation,    encouraged the substitution of domestic manufactures for imported goods, as    did expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.<a name="not6"></a><a href="#6not"><sup>6</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Argentina, Brazil,    and Chile made rapid advances in industrial production during the early depression    years, so that by 1935 a North American economist would hazard that "There    is probably no major section of the world in which there is greater industrial    activity relative to predepression years than in temperate South America"    (i.e., Argentina, southern Brazil, and Chile) (Phelps, 1935: 281). When war    came in 1939, manufactures in international trade became scarce again, permitting    industrial advances to the extent that capital goods, fuel, and raw materials    were available.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>II</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The preceding survey    of economic transformation, however brief, provides a foundation for understanding    the ways in which Latin American social thinkers and statesmen of the era conceptualized    their nation's place in the order of things. It will be argued that the perceived    success of the "open economy" strategy, beginning in the mid-nineteenth    century with rising levels of exports in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil, shaped    the terms of ideological discourse even into the 1940 's. However, before preceding    to the ideologies that attracted Latin Americans and were in turn adapted by    them to local conditions, it is necessary to consider the sociological situation    of the intellectuals who were the bearers of such ideas and values.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The intellectual    traditions of Latin America revolved around the <i>pensador </i>(lit., thinker),    a man who prided himself on his broad culture and who eschewed specialization:    He often wrote as readily about contemporary sociology and politics as he did    about literature, and his studies frequently crossed disciplinary lines. The    <i>pensador's </i>vehicle was the essay, a literary form that in Latin America    retains the prestige it has all but lost in the English-speaking world.<a name="not7"></a><a href="#7not"><sup>7</sup></a>     The style perhaps was appropriate to highly stratified, pre-industrial societies;    in any case the <i>pensador </i>often wrote without reference to monographic    studies. His judgments tended to be definitive; his treatment, historical. Before    1900, and even later, few Latin American essayists were academics, and fewer    still had studied in Europe. If they had, they almost never took research degrees.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One feature distinguishing    Latin American society from that of eastern Europe in this period is a relative    lack of an intelligentsia, in the classical sense of an underemployed intellectual    community radically at odds with prevailing power structures. This fact owes    chiefly to the limited number of university students, compared to employment    opportunities in law, journalism, and civil service. Furthermore, intellectuals    frequently held important political posts.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such intelligentsia    as existed was composed as often as not of self-educated men like Afonso Henriques    Lima Barreto, the Brazilian novelist and radical social critic, and Jose Carlos    Mariátegui, the Peruvian Marxist. But such figures were realtively so few as    to lack the group-consciousness one associates with an intelligentsia; they    were perhaps closer to a bohemia.<a name="not8"></a><a href="#8not"><sup>8</sup></a>  More conventional intellectuals    in university posts, for example, were usually less radical, though often reformist    in orientation. In any event, seldom could the <i>pensador </i>be Gramsci's    "organic intellectual," a spokesman for well-defined class interests,    since social classes were still relatively inchoate.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A sociological    reason for the persistence of the <i>pensador </i>tradition is that academic    institutions were seldom oriented toward research. In addition, Latin America    suffered from a relative dearth of social research institutions as such. There    was nothing comparable to Dimitri Gusti's Romanian Institute of Social Science,    founded in 1918. Romania also boasted an Economics Institute (established in    1921), and a Business Cycles Institute, modeled in 1933 on those at Harvard    and the University of Berlin. The only analogous institutes anywhere in Latin    America in the 1920's and 1930's were the research division of the Argentine    Central Bank, which Raul Prebisch organized in 1928, and an economics research    institute founded at the University of Mexico (UNAM) in the same year.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Hate's survey    of Latin American social and political thought over the half century ending    in 1930, only one intellectual of some ninety treated, the Mexican Manuel Gamio,    held a Ph.D.(1986: 434, n. 138).<a name="not9"></a><a href="#9not"><sup>9</sup></a>    Such a fact might imply the weakness of a research tradition, as opposed to    the abstract theorizing and indifference to the systematic collection of a data    so characteristic of the <i>pensador </i>style. There was, for example, nothing    to compare with the Romanian comunity studies of the 1920's and 1930's carried    out by Gusti and his students, based on the theories and methods of Le Play    and Chayanov. The partial exception was provided by Mexico, where Gamio and    other anthropologists had begun to map out local village ethnography.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>III</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>pensadores    </i>at issue lived in an age of triumphant liberalism, with manifold sub-themes    and arabesques. In Latin America, as elsewhere, liberalism implied the diffusion    of materialism, rationalism, and pluralism (the latter used by reformist states    against the Church). Liberalism gained strength in the middle decades of the    nineteenth century, as economic advances improved the climate for the reception    of liberal economic ideas (Safford, 1985: 353-54). Following the European lead,    Latin American liberalism changed over the course of the century, and in the    early years of independence its paladins focused on opening international trade,    secularization, and securing equality before the law in a society still dominated    by estates and corporations. Late in the century, when liberal politicians reigned    supreme, there was much less concern with individual rights: "English liberties"    were frequently seen as less important than economic growth and the orderly    development of the social organism. Thus liberalism, in Hale's words, was transformed    over the course of the nineteenth century from an "ideology in conflict    with the inherited colonial order" into a "unifying &#91;establishment&#93;    myth" (1986: 369). It also offered a rationale for social control within    the new order.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In general, Latin    America statesmen and intellectuals welcomed the economic transformation of    their region accompanying the Second Industrial Revolution and the expansion    of European trade; thus there was little debate about the desirability of integration    into the dynamic North Atlantic center as an agricultural and mineral periphery,    in contrast to the eastern European response by the 1880's. Latin Americans    embraced the doctrine of comparative advantage, though few were aware of Ricardo    's formal demonstration that a comparative (relative) advantage in the production    of two goods in two countries implied mutual benefit to both trading partners.    The vast majority of Latin American "economists" simply argued from    the perception of absolute advantage, i.e., they saw world commerce as a mutually    beneficial process among countries with highly differentiated natural and social    endowments.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the penetration    of European trade and investment was, for the Latin American statesmen of the    latter half of the nineteenth century, far more than an acceleration of economic    growth; they viewed it as part of a transformation from "barbarism"    to "civilization," as a future president of Argentina, Domingo Faustino    Sarmiento, put it in his <i>Facundo </i>of 1845(1961). Here there seems to be    a parallel with the Balkan countries of the same era, as the Turkish Empire    receded. Indeed, some Spanish American statesmen and intellectuals, especially    in the second quarter of the century, regarded the culture of the intransigent    and irreconcilable Spanish metropolis, where the Inquisition survived until    1820, as the most important cause of Latin America's backwardness. For Francisco    Bilbao, a leading figure in Chile's Generation of 1842, "Spain &#91;was&#93; the    Middle Ages."</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consequently, Latin    American intellectuals tended to view the myriad changes associated with capitalist    relations of production and exchange after 1870 as a benign, progressive, and    civilizing process. Liberal intellectuals toward the end of the century were    in a celebratory mood, eager to create heroic myths, as did the historian and    statesman Bartolomé Mitre (president of Argentina, 1862-68). Surviving "feudal"    or archaic elements in local societies were for these men simply the residues    of the colonial regime, doomed by the linear march of progress associated with    capitalist development. Apart from the pamphlet literature of radical sectors    of the labor movement (largely anarchist), there was no " teratological    perception" of capitalist transformation such an Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea    provided in his analysis of Romanian society in 1910 (see below). All the same,    compulsory labor systems and the concentration of land ownership in Mexico were    underlying causes of the revolution that began in the year Gherea published;    to a lesser extent such conditions obtained in some areas of the other three    countries under consideration. Where injustice was denounced by bourgeois intellectuals,    as in <i>Los grandes problemas nacionales </i>(1909) by the Mexican Andrés Molina    Enriquez, the fault lay not in the system, but in its local distortions.<a name="not10"></a><a href="#10not"><sup>10</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Until the twentieth    century, liberalism in Latin America, unlike Romania, was strikingly cosmopolitan,    as perhaps befitted the "open" economies of the region.<a name="not11"></a><a href="#11not"><sup>11</sup></a>     Nationalism began to replace cosmopolitanism gradually  in part because of    resentment against the flood of immigrants in Argentina, in part because of    the disillusion with cosmopolitanism that Latin Americans experienced in August,    1914, and in part because of the disarticulation of the international economy    after 1929.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The years of "conflict"    for liberalism to which Hale refers began with independence and continued into    the 1870's or even to 1890 (1986).<a name="not12"></a><a href="#12not"><sup>12</sup></a>  Political struggles in the first    fifty years of independence, the nonage of liberalism, revolved around human    rights (including the emancipation of slaves and Indians); the position of the    Church in society, economy, and polity; the place of foreign trade; and the    organization of the state (centralism vs. federalism, taxing powers). After    long struggles, these issues were generally resolved in favor of an expansion    of the number of participating citizens, secularization, an open economy, and    a powerful central government, even though three of the four countries considered    here finally adopted federal constitutions. The triumph of secularization in    some countries had required a powerful state (Hale, 1986: 377-78), and partly    for that reason liberals in most countries accepted a degree of interventionism    alien to classical liberal precepts.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is remarkable,    perhaps, how poorly articulated at an intellectual level was the opposition    to liberalism, until the 1920's and 1930's, when corporatism and Marxism became    widely diffused. In the nineteenth century, opposition to liberalism tended    to be organized around the privileges of the colonial regime, and prelates articulated    the dissatisfaction with republicanism, free-masonry, and other modern heresies,    ticking off the list of Pius IX's <i>Syllabus of Errors </i>(1864). Of course    there was nothing approximating a succesful bourgeois revolution, to which conservatives    might have reacted more inventively. Almost all the leading intellectuals were    liberals: Only three early statesmen  Lucas Alamán in Mexico, Mariano Egaña    in Chile, and José Bonifacio Andrada e Silva in Brazil  perhaps bore some resemblance    to Edmund Burke, and there were no systematizing reactionaries in the mold of    Joseph de Maistre. Nor was there anything akin to Slavophilism's mystical association    of anti-rationalism and nationalism, partly because Latin American conservatives    were not reacting to Hegelianism the first fifty years after independence. In    the early years of nationhood, since conservatism was associated with maintaining    or restoring privileges of the old regime, its appeal was limited. For some,    however, conservatism was also an outlook attaching fundamental importance to    "the existence of a perennial order ... &#91;for which&#93; change always represents    an evil: decadence, perversion, chaos, "in Romero's words (1970: 28). Not    only was conservatism closely associated with the Church, a supranational entity,    but in the worst case, Maximilian's Mexico, the Church and the Conservative    party sold out to the foreign invader, Napoleon III. In most countries, conservatism    in the latter years of the century was to be most effectively defended within    the various currents of liberalism, especially after liberals consolidated their    control of the state.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Liberalism came    to Latin America in a variety of forms, beginning with Benthamism in the 1820    's, and continuing through Social Darwinism in the 1890's. A related but distinct    ideology was Comtian positivism, influential in ail four countries. French    philosophy had conquered Latin America with the triumph of eclecticism over    a dying scholasticism in the early years of independence, and Comte's all-embracing    system attracted intellectuals trained in scholasticism more than did British    liberalism. Comte's vision of civilization had the historical process unfolding    in three great stages, epistimologically determined: the theological, the metaphysical,    and the positive. In the first stage, causation was assigned to supernatural    forces; in the second, to abstract forces; and in the third  on the edge of    which humanity stood, he believed, in the mid-nineteenth century  to discoverable    scientific laws.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comte called for    the tempering of capitalism by social morality, and asserted the need for the    state to incorporate the urban proletariat into modern society with social welfare    policies. He also supported universal elementary education and the separation    of Church and state. Naturally, not all of Comte's specific prescriptions had    universal appeal, especially those produced after his authoritarian turn in    the wake of 1848. The Religion of Humanity of his final years, a grotesque secularization    of Catholicism (<i>Ave Clotilda!</i>), attracted only a small but vocal    sect, especially in Chile and Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Positivism was    attractive to modernizing conservatives, who wanted the benefits of material    progress without sacrificing social hierarchy. Comte's philosophy seemed to    offer a blueprint for development without social mobilization; the proletariat,    as noted, was to be the special concern of a paternalist state. In addition,    we may surmise that Comtek emphais on the <i>family </i>as the fundamental unit    of social organization  as opposed to the individual, in British liberalism     made his system especially seductive. (Corporatism would make the same assertion    in our own century).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1870's Comtian    positivism was closely linked to nation-building, and it became the official    philosophy of new national normal schools in Chile, Mexico, and Argentina; it    played the same role at the national military academy in Brazil. Comte's phrase    "Order and Progress" seemed to be in tune with new consolidating regimes,    and it became the official motto of the new Brazilian Republic.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet Herbert Spencer's    Social Darwinism had a wider following by the 1890's; Spencer seemed to represent    the interests of a nascent but increasingly self-confident bourgeoisie, at least    in Argentina (Zea, 1963: 216-17, 227).<a name="not13"></a><a href="#13not"><sup>13</sup></a>  By the last two decades    of the century, Spencer also provided a    convenient rationalization for dictatorships, which now had a new staying power,    partly because of new revenues resulting from economic growth. Such was the    case with the government of Rafael Nuñez, the dictator of Colombia in the 1880's,    who used Social Darwinism to justify his "scientific peace." In Mexico,    where the writings of Comte after 1848 could already could be construed as justifying    dictatorship, Social Darwinism was likewise pressed into service for the Porfiriato.    For the <i>científicos, </i>who made their debut to justify the fourth term    of the dictator Díaz in 1892, material progress was a necessary precondition    for political liberty. The only liberty for which Mexico was then ready, they    averred, was freedom of commerce, which not incidentally legitimated the foreign    capital pouring into the country. Díaz's regime was a "social dictatorship,"    they argued, promoting the interests of the bourgeoisie and those of the nation    at large.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comte ans Spencer    were simply the most prominent of the French and British thinkers whose ideas    were discovered and adapted in Latin America. Of course, as a "fragment"    society of Europe (Hartz, 1964: 3-6), Latin America only imported portions of    the European intellectual tradition, and it adapted liberal ideologies to meet    a variety of desiderata, such as social control, as the<i> científicos </i>perhaps    illustrated most starkly. By the 1890's liberalism was an "officialist"    ideology, probably accepted most widely in those countries where the export    economies performed best.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>IV</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To better understand    the peculiar features of Latin American social thought in succeeding decades     necessarily a truncated and adapted version of European models  a brief excursus    on contemporaneous eastern Europe may be enlightening, on the premise that movements    not present in Latin America may reveal something about the history of those    that were. One of the traditions so influential in the former region having    no reverberations in Latin America was nineteenth-century populism: to most    of us this was "Russian" populism, although the ideology had its roots    in reactions to the social processes of the industrial revolution in western    and central Europe (for a summary, see Kitching, 1982: ch. 2).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Populism was an    ideology starting from a vision of local society as backward, even archaic,    relative to the developed West. Industrial capitalism, an irresistible force    emanating from abroad, was viewed as transforming local agriculture-based societies    in undesirable ways. It ruined, then proletarianized, the peasant and artisan    classes, partly through a process of unequal exchange between town and hinterland,    and between industrial and agricultural societies at the international level.    Moreover, capitalism at the local level was seen as degenerate and essentially    destined to fail against the superior competition of the West. In its mature    phase, populism was an ideology of non-capitalist modernization, akin to socialism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The best-known    and most important variety was doubtless the Narodnik movement in Russia. Its    origin can be traced to the writings and political activity of Alexander Herzen,    the exiled aristocrat who was the first (from    1849) to associate Russia's tradition of communal property, the <i>obshchina,    </i>and its council, the <i>mir,</i> not with a vision of the past, as it was    for the Slavophiles, but with a vision of the socialist future. Herzen was thus    the first to theorize the possibility of "skipping stages" in moving    from "feudalism" to socialism (see Venturi, 1960: ch. 1).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Russia Herzen    could build on, and transform, the conservative school of Slavophilism, a reaction    to Hegelianism, which was irrelevant in both Romania and Latin America. By the    1860's, Russian populism, in its violent form, insisted that action was urgent,    since the transition to socialism had to be undertaken before capitalism had    triumphed in the countryside, immiserizing the peasantry and destroying the    <i>obshchina, </i>the basis on which a socialist society could be constructed.    The People's Will, viewing the state as the driving force behind Russia's efforts    to catch up with the West, assassinated Alexander II in 1881, but tsarist reaction    easily prevailed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly, such populist    concerns would heve seemed alien to Latin American intellectuals of the 1870's,    for whom state-building rather than state-destruction was the objective of the    era. And many Latin American intellectuals in the liberal era had opportunities    to direct the state (wittfess Sarmiento and Mitre), which Russian intellectuals    of integrity simply lacked, even when they spent years in state service, as    did Herzen himself (Gerschenkron, 1966: 189; Herzen, 1982: 253-83).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Russia, populism    and Marxism were movements with strong Hegelian foundations, both dating from    the middle years of the century. Populists and Marxists both viewed the penetration    of capitalism into Russia and its consequences as <i>the </i>social problem,    and advocates of the two schools engaged in a modes-of-production debate as    it applied to Russia. While the populists strove to overcome capitalism, to    pass beyond it, Marxists viewed the triumph of capitalism in that country as    a grim necessity  or an accomplished fact, by the time of Lenin's <i>The Development    of Capitalism in Russia </i>(1899).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It seems clear    that however backward were Russia's society and state, Russian intellectuals    participated in European social movements and social theorizing in ways not    possible for Latin Americans. Herzen and Bakunin, for example, were aristocrats    with broad European experience, and at ease in German or French as well as in    Russian. Bakunin was Marx's antagonist in the First International, and Russian    revolutionaries, frequently in exile, were continually in contact with Western    radicals.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The diffusion of    Hegel's philosophy among Russian intellectuals of a variety of social backgrounds    was extensive by the 1840's, and Hegel's dialectic was employed by populists    like Alexander Chernyschevsky in the 1860's to further develop Herzen's views    on stage-skipping to socialism. The fact that Hegel had little influence in    Latin America before the 1870's  or later outside formal philosophy  thus    tended to close off the obvious paths to Marxism and populism, both of which    ideologies developed in uniquely radical ways in Europe's most reactionary state.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Polarization in    Russia was a readily comprehensible process, and hence so were the unique ways    in which radical philosophies developed; but it is perhaps more elucidating    for the Latin American case to consider social doctrines in Romania. There,    as in Latin America, but in contrast to Russia, liberal political institutions    prevailed from 1866, when a constitution based on Belgium's was instituted.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Romania, the only    country of eastern Europe where a Romance language is spoken, achieved its formal    independence from Turkey in stages between 1859 and 1877. Thus, like Latin America,    it emerged from a patrimonial (if non-western) empire attempting to institute    administrative reform. Romania's parliamentary government was controlled by    an oligarchy, but like those of some Latin American states, it underwent a crisis    and partial transformation in the early twentieth century (Mouzelis, 1986: 3-4,    72)  in the Romanian case, because of the First World War and subsequent land    reform. By the postwar Treaty of Trianon, Romania's leaders managed to double    the national territory and population, as a reward for timely declarations of    war. Thus, as one of the succession states to the Austrian and Russian Empires,    " Greater Romania" was even more obviously the locus for a debate    about economic development than had been the "Old Kingdom" without    Transylvania and Bessarabia.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Romania's Black    Sea ports had been opened to west European trade by the Treaty of Adrianople    in 1829, a date often noted as the beginning of the transformation of the country    as a grain supplier. Serfdom was formally abolished in 1864, and exports expanded    rapidly.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As in Latin America,    the West's influence in Romania was seen as transforming and civilizing, dating    from the Napoleonic era, when Romanians began to abandon the caftan and adopt    the dress and cultural fashions of the West. As the century advanced, the use    of French became mandatory for all those laying claim to general education.    Liberal economics was associated with economic development and the civilizing    (or Europeanizing) process, and its tenets were taught in the new universities    of the early 1860's. In the words of one student, "economic liberties were    in harmony with the movement of national rebirth, of passing to a European style    of life, of breaking the chains of the regime of Turkish capitulations. "Liberal    economics was not only seen as a necessary guide for development and a counterpart    to liberal political institutions, but was insistently pressed on the Romanians    by Great Britain and France, which helped guarantee Romanian independence from    Turkey (Demetrescu, n.d.: 270, 274).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The classical era    of free trade in Romania was brief, however, spanning only the years 1875-86.    The international depression of 1873-96 resulted in the closing of foreign markets    for Romania's cereal exports, beginning with Germany's new tariff of 1879. After    a customs war with Austria, Romania reactively turned to industrial protection    in its own tariff of 1886. Relatively inefficient compared to "overseas"    grain exporters to Europe, Romania could not compete in the British market with    Argentina and the Dominions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, Romania's    economic growth rate was more than respectable for the last three decades before    the First World War, as wheat exports revived, and the country began to export    petroleum. The value of exports rose from 9 million dollars in 1850 to 136 million    in 1915. Between 1880 and 1910, Romania's annual rate of export growth, at 3.3%,    was higher than that of the periphery of European states as a whole (2.8%).    And per capita income, at 307 dollars in 1910, was higher than that of Portugal    and the other Balkan states, excepting Greece. However, there was a price to    pay: 80% of all industrial    shares were in foreign hands, as was 75% of the capital in banking at the time    of the War (Berend &amp; Ránki, 1982: 83, 115, 123, 156). In addition, there    is abundant evidence that the income differential between the peasantry and    other sectors of society was widening.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The abolition of    serfdom had been an instance of "symbolic modernization," in J. K.    Galbraith's phrase, and the peasant's living conditions seriously deteriorated    from the 1870's through the early years of the new century: Romanian landlords    had been able to compete in the international market by reducing costs, i.e.,    by squeezing more and more labor out of the peasantry (Chirot, 1976: chs. 6-7;    Eidelberg, 1974; Dobrogeanu-Gherea, 1977a). The great peasant revolt of 1907,    arising from the evils of latifundist (and often absentee) agriculture, resulted    in the army's massacring 10,000 peasants, and stimulated the efforts of those    who sought to critique the foundations of the "liberal" economy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In a country cheek-to-jowl    with Russia, it is hardly surprising that the ideological conflict between Marxists    and Narodniki had powerful repercussions. In Romania, the two leading exponents    of both populism and Marxism had spent their formative years in Russia, absorbing    the radical ideologies of-Russian politics: Constantin Stere, the leading turn-of-the-century    populist, was born a scion of boyars in (Russian) Bessarabia, and his Marxist    antagonist, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (<i>né </i>Solomon Katz), spent his    youth in the Ukraine. Their debates, and those of their ideological allies in    Romanian journals from 1890 to 1920, asked basic questions about the path to    capitalist development, including the issue of whether the existing economy    of Romania could be defined as capitalist, precapitalist, or some fusion of    the two. The Gherea-Stere debate among other things treated the matter whether    socialism was "an exotic plant" in an agricultural country. It paralleled    a less elaborate but contemporary debate between the founder of the Argentine    Socialist Party, Juan B. Justo, and Italian sociologist Enrico Ferri over whether    socialism had a present, as well as future, in Argentina (Romero, 1983: 80-81).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stere deemed socialism    irrelevant for a society with 88 peasants for every factory worker. Socialism    did not address the problems of the overwhelming majority, he believed, and    socialists had no chance of taking power to implement their program (Stere,    1907-08: II, 320-21, 323). Industrialization, based on high tariffs in 1886    and 1906, had failed, Stere asserted in 1908. The basic conditions were lacking:    To become an industrial state, Romania required heavy industry, and the production    of capital goods in turn required large markets. Romania    had no domestic market of consequence, and no realistic chance of competing    internationally. Agriculture, Stere contended, citing Karl Kautsky, Germany's    leading Marxist theoretician, was not subject to Marx's laws of the concentration    and centralization of capital. For Stere, the solution lay in destroying the    latifundium and developing agricultural cooperatives and cottage industry (Stere,    1907-08, II, 188-89, 330; III, 60-61, 68).<a name="not14"></a><a href="#14not"><sup>14</sup></a>  In part because Romania    lacked a tradition comparable to the <i>obshchina, </i>Stere and his populist    allies never advocated "stage-skipping" to socialism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stere's ideological    opponent, Dobrogeanu-Gherea, assumed the task of demonstrating the relevance    of socialism for a backward peasant society. More important, however, was his    Marxist critique of the existing social formation. He was among the first theorists    to argue (in 1910) that traditional modes of production in backward countries    interacted with capitalism to form a unique amalgam  in fact a new mode  and,    in the event, a monstrous one. His novel proposition can be contrasted with    the fact that eleven years earlier, Lenin had characterized Russia's economy    as one in which capitalism, even in agriculture, was inexorably eliminating    its "feudal" predecessor (1956: 151, 172-74, 182, 250, 347, 555).    For Latin Americanists, it is notable that Gherea 's effort to define a mode    of production unique to backward countries enveloped by capitalism occurred    60 years before the continentwide debate in which Latin Americans "discovered"    modes of production by which capitalism subordinated precapitalist modes in    unique patterns.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Reacting to Stere's    charges that Romania was overwhelmingly an agrarian nation and that Marxist    socialism as a program for the nation was a an absurdity, Gherea held that Romania    was already a "semi-capitalist" country, and that the process of capitalist    penetration was too far advanced to "skip" capitalism on the route    from feudalism to socialism. Though contending that Marxist laws of development    were valid for a backward agricultural country like Romania, Gherea conceded    that such laws manifested themselves in a much more complex and confused fashion    than in the West (1977c: 456, 458-60).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the same year,    1908, he wrote that Romania had a legal structure appropriate for a capitalist    society, but neither a capitalist class nor a proletariat. Backward couintries    such as Romania were becoming satellites as the capitalist world-economy expanded.    Gherea now borrowed and reinterpreted an idea from Romania's Junimea school     <i>forma fara fond </i>(form without substance)  whose leaders had been trained    in Germany and steeped in Hegelianism: In Gherea's Marxist terms, superstructure    had preceded the base, in that Romania had adopted Western institutions without    the social and economic conditions requisite    for their effective functioning (1977b: 478-82).<a name="not15"></a><a href="#15not"><sup>15</sup></a> Commenting on    the gap between the formal and the real country, Gherea noted that the situation    contrasted sharply with that of absolutist Russia, where the "real"    state of development was ahead of that of the legal system. Under the circumstances,    thought Gherea, Romanian socialists should strive for the development of an    authentic capitalism, which would bring in its train an enforceable modern legal    system, instead of the sham the country then knew (1977b: 498-99, 503).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In "Socialism    in Underdeveloped Countries," an essay written in 1912, Gherea elaborated    on the theme of the differences between the evolution of the central capitalist    countries and their backward dependencies. In the latter, evolution was much    faster, and of a different character, since changes in the form or superstructure    preceded those in the base. This situation resulted from the fact that the advanced    capitalist countries determined the evolution of the whole system. Gherea proceeded    to formulate a "law of backward societies," i.e., those on the periphery    of the capitalist center: "In advanced capitalist countries, social forms    follow the social &#91;and economic&#93; base; in underdeveloped countries, the social    base comes after the social forms" (1945: 8-9).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For Gherea, backward    countries in the capitalist orbit suffered both from capitalism (in Romania,    boyar exploitation of peasants to maximize profits in the international market)    and the insufficient development of capitalism (its incapacity locally to destroy    feudal relations of production) (1945: 27).<a name="not16"></a><a href="#16not"><sup>16</sup></a>  In this regard, Gherea    noted, the Romanian bourgeoisie had utterly failed to transform the national    economy, as its counterpart and exemplar had done in the advanced capitalist    countries. The bourgeoisie of western Europe had betrayed its defense of the    Rights of Man after 1789, but the Romanian bourgeoisie had nothing to betray.    While the Western bourgeoisie had to fight for the creation of liberal institutions,    they were subsequently imported into Romania by a process in which the local    bourgeoisie "played the smallest possible role." Rather, it was the    boyars who, under Western influence, created the liberal state in Romania. The    local bourgeoisie, such as it was, took the place of the boyars as a new "semifeudal    class,"keeping intect many feudal social relations (Dobrogeanu-Gherea,    1945:34).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dobrogeanu-Gherea's    magnum opus had appeared in 1910, addressing the central problem of Romanian    society of the era  peasant unrest. The laconic title of Gherea's study, <i>Neoiobagia    </i>(neoserfdom), epitomized the proposition that a new and monstrous mode of    production had reared its head in Romania. Put briefly, the mode was a fusion    of precapitalist social and economic relations in the countryside and the economic    relations and superstructure of an advancing capitalism at the national and    international levels.<a name="not17"></a><a href="#17not"><sup>17</sup></a>    In the traditional form of<i> iobagia, </i>there has been three basic features:    The peasant was fixed to the lord's lands; he was forced to provide corvee labor    for his master; and he had to pay tribute in kind as well as other forms of    feudal dues (1977a: 64).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Neoiobagia </i>was    a hybrid form having the following defining characteristics: 1) Its relations    of production were largely feudal; 2) at the ideological and legal level, it    was overlaid with a liberal-bourgeois legal system that had the effect of leaving    the peasant at the mercy of the landlord;<a name="not18"></a><a href="#18not"><sup>18</sup></a>  3) it further included    a tutelary legislation that declared the inalienability of peasant land, and    regulated relations between the lord and the workers; 4) at the economic level,    the system did not provide the small peasant farmer enough land for subsistence,    a fact which forced him to become a vassal of the owner of the land he farmed    as a laborer or sharecropper (1977a: 281).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Neoiobagia </i>came    into being as boyars saw opportunities to obtain hard currencies, and thereby    to secure a flow of Western goods; such wares were especially deemed desirable    after the Westernization of the boyar class had begun with the Napoleonic Wars.    As a result, wrote Ghcrea, Romania had entered the "great world division    of labor" and now "sends food to the West and receives from it industrial    and cultural goods." Concomitant with Romania's growth of trade came a    monetized economy, a development that required centuries to consolidate in the    West (1977a:34).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus for Gherea,    as for many others, western markets had partially revolutionized Romania's national    economy. With the appearance of a money economy, Gherea held, the exploitation    of the peasantry no longer had any legal limits. An extra-economic compulsion    of the labor force by the rural police (<i>dorobanti</i>) to enforce    labor contracts, combined with greatly increased periods of corvee labor, further    led Gherea to the judgment that Romania had developed "a double agrarian    regime... &#91;one&#93; both capitalist and serf-based...absurd, hateful... a monstrous    regime" (1977a: 80).<a name="not19"></a><a href="#19not"><sup>19</sup></a>    "Neoserfdom," as Gherea styled Romania's system, had the advantage    for the former boyars of freeing them of all traditional obligations to the    peasantry; they could exploit labor without hindrance from the state, and without    having to deal with free workers (who might organize to resist) (1977a: 82).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Gherea, as an orthodox    social democrat, if an unorthodox theorist, favored industrialization, and a    rising school of corporatists, who initially called themselves "neoliberals,"    soon took up the same cause.<a name="not20"></a><a href="#20not"><sup>20</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The First World    War resulted in a major land reform, resolving one part of the agrarian problem.    Now the tempo of the debate on development quickened, as Romanian intellectuals    and statesmen were impressed by two phenomena  the failure of Romanian agriculture    to regain the position in wheat exports it had held before the War (falling    from fifth to tenth place internationally), and, in the latter 1920's, the massive    industrialization drive of the U.S.S.R., which had not recognized Romania's    incorporation of Bessarabia.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the interwar    era, a number of economists  some holding German doctorates  were influenced    by social and economic theories then circulating in Europe, including Soviet    Marxism, German and Austrian corporatism, the German "Historical"    school of Schmoller, and Chayanov's theories on peasant economics. The influence    of Werner Sombart and Rudolf Hilferding was especially notable, and many non-Marxists    subscribed to Hilferding's periodization of the history of capitalism into commercial,    industrial, and financial phases, to which corresponded the ideologies of mercantilism,    liberalism, and imperialism, (e.g. Zeletin, 1925: 18; Manoilescu, 1940: 224;    Madgearu, n.d.: 5).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the ferment    of the interwar years, the economist whose work was probably most often discussed    abroad was Mihail Manoilescu, who had trained as an engineer before educating    himself in economics. He was also "furiously ambitious" as a politician,    in the words of a British ambassador,<a name="not21"></a><a href="#21not"><sup>21</sup></a>  and knew triumph and subsequent    disgrace in the rough-and-tumble of Balkan politics; in 1940 he ceded half of    Romania's newly-acquired Transylvania to Hungary under pressure from Ribbentrop    and Ciano. Manoilescu was the only Romanian whose theories were known in Latin    America, and his reputation as economist in the 1930's was probably given a    boost in the region by his work as a theorist of corporatism. Both his economic    and political works were translated into Spanish and Portuguese in the 1930's    and 1940's.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an economist,    Manoilescu's chief concern was with the relationship between the purchasing    power of a unit of labor expended in producing a good traded on the world market    in terms of the labor of other workers abroad  a concept now called the "double    factorial terms of trade." Manoilescu held that labor productivity in industry    (manufacturing and mining) was inherently superior to that in agriculture, by    a ratio of four or more to one. This superiority owed to "specific capital,"    i.e., the much higher value of capital per worker in industry than that in agriculture.    The Romanian developed a mathematical formula that would array all industrial    and agricultural activities by their productivities (1929: 177).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Manoilescu, like    Marx, Ricardo, and other classical economists, believed in the labor theory    of value; since labor could create capital as well as commodities, it should    be directed, he believed, toward the activities that would maximize labor productivity.    The issue for him was not comparative advantage, as for Ricardo, since this    theory "prescribed" a division of world labor into industrial and    agricultural specialists; rather, the issue was whether a given economic endeavor    within a country had a labor productivity higher than the national average.    If it did, he believed, its development should be encouraged (1929: 183). Specialization    in traditional agricultural pursuits required four hours of Romanian labor to    purchase the product of a single hour of English labor. Thus international trade    was a swindle, and the world market, <i>un marché de dupes </i>for raw materials    producers. Protection for industry was justifiable, not just in terms of Friedrich    List's "infant industry" argument, by which an enterprise would take    advantage of economies of scale and external economies over the intermediate    run to bring costs down to internationally competitive levels; rather, protection    was justified because a sheltered industry that had a labor productivity higher    than the national average of economic activities was a boon from its first day    of operation. The more productivity of a given good exceeded the average national    productivity, the more the domestic price of that good could justifiably exceed    the foreign price (1929: 161).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To engage in agricultural    exports, Manoilescu argued, the comparative advantage of domestic agriculture    over its foreign counterpart must be greater than the intrinsic superiority    in labor productivity of industry over agriculture within the country (1986:    234). Such cases were rare, Manoilescu thought, since agriculture in Romania    and other underdeveloped countries with dense populations was primitive in technique    and was consequently labor-intensive. In sum, by challenging the legitimacy    of the international division of labor, he was also attacking international    trady theory, and his works quickly drew sharp attacks from leading trade theorists    in the United States and Europe.<a name="not22"></a><a href="#22not"><sup>22</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>V</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This brief view    of social and economic ideas in Romania illustrates the kinds of European intellectual    currents adapted by social thinkers in that country. Although the Russian influence    in Romania was strong, that of Germany was stronger, of which trend Marxism    provides a major example.

German social science would begin to transform Latin American    social thought after the arrival of Spanish exiles fleeing the Franco regime    in the late 1930's.

He regarded the Latin American political process    as the embodiment of Bonapartism and reaction. Furthermore, Marx had a low opinion    of the liberator Simón Bolívar, whom he privately compared to Faustin Soulouque,    the Haitian dictator whose bragadoccio Marx used to parody Napoleon III. Marx's    lack of concern about Latin America has even provoked a study of the reasons    for it by the region's leading student of Marxism, José Aricó. (1982: 40, 107,    116-17).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marxism was thus    poorly understood and poorly diffused before the Third International (1919),    though the assertion is somewhat less valid for Argentina than for other countries.<a name="not27"></a><a href="#27not"><sup>27</sup></a>    Latin American radicalism, like its Iberian counterpart, tended to revolve around    anarchism more than socialism at least until the 1920 's, and in many countries    until the 1930's. In addition, most socialist parties were not exclusively or    predominantly Marxist-oriented until the Third International forced the issue    in the early 1920's. One indication of the thinness of the Marxist tradition    is that there were no "legal Marxists" like Peter Struve or Zeletin    in Spanish or Portuguese America, i.e., there were no revisionists who argued    that capitalism in backward countries would develop through Marxist stages,    but that the rise of a local bourgeoisie was both inevitable and beneficial.    Ironically, despite earlier twists and turns, the official position of the Communist    parties of the region in the 1950's would come very close to "Zeletinism,"    because support for the national bourgeoisie was identified with anti-imperialism    and anti-feudalism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The man generally    conceded to be the most important Marxist thinker in Latin America    before the Second World War, Jose Carlos Mariátegui of Peru, was also one of    the least orthodox, and was heavily influenced by Sorel. Mariátegui's principal    contribution to Marxist theory as such was probably his argument that, in the    age of imperialism, capitalism had arrived in Latin America too late for local    bourgeoisies to emulate the historic roles of their European forebears (1980:    113; see also Paris, 1981: 145). Mariátegui would have agreed with Romania's    Dobrogeanu-Gherea that underdeveloped countries suffer both from (external)    capitalism and the insufficient developement of capitalism at the local level.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mariátegui was    also heterodox in another regard. Though his position was ambiguous, he hinted    that Peru's indigenous <i>ayllu, </i>which he viewed as an Incaic form of agrarian    communism, could be the foundation for the transformation from a semi-feudal    stage of development directly to socialism in the countryside. Thus Mariátegui    would seem to be a "stage-skipper," despite his following Lenin in    condemning the Narodniki. Nor was Mariátegui alone: The idea that peasant collectivism    could be the basis for passing from "feudalism" to socialism was shared    by a leading Latin American spokesman at the sixth congress of the Communist    International in 1928, Ricardo Paredes of Ecuador; Paredes' views were echoed    by a Uruguayan delegate, Sala. (Internacional Comunista, 1978: II, 180-81, 367).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the event, Mariátegui's    praise of "Incaic socialism" (a discovery, by the way, of Plekhanov's,    a generation earlier), seemed to a Comintern critic in 1941 a reincarnation    of the Russian populist tradition (Miroshevski, 1980: 55-70, esp. 68; Paris,    1981: 183). To the degree the charge is justified, Marfategui appears to have    fallen into populist "error," in part, because of the absence of classical    populism in Latin America.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reasons for    populism's nonappearance in the region are worth speculating about. In many    countries there was no large peasantry, in the sense of freeholders; nor, in    most nations, was there a primitive commune in any way comparable to the Russian    <i>obshchina. </i>Yet neither of these conditions blocked the rise of populism    as a major ideological current in Romania. Latin Americans, of course, did not    have access to the nineteenth-century Russian debate about capitalism, as did    the Romanians, but the late appearance of Hegelianism and then of Marxism in    Latin America may also have been causes of the absence of populism. As Walicki    and Venturi have demonstrated, the rise of populism in Russia was intimately    connected with intellectuals' coming to terms with Marxism (Walicki, 1969: 26,    132; Venturi, 1960: 365, 384, <i>passim</i>).<a name="not28"></a><a href="#28not"><sup>28</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is nonetheless    important to qualify the absence of populism by distinguishing, as lonescu does,    between "populism" and "peasantism"  the latter being a    legal political movement based on the newly-enfranchised peasant masses, occurring    largely after the First World War in the cases of Romania and most other countries    of eastern Europe (lonescu, 1969: 98-99). There is an obvious analog to peasantism    in Latin American <i>indigenismo, </i>a multifaceted ideology finding its fullest    expression in the Mexican Revolution, and encompassing the glorification, "redemption,"    and study of Amerindian populations. In the 1920's Mexico's minister of education,    José Vasconcelos, in a rare commitment to empiricism, sent students into the    countryside to observe local conditions. The Revolution's interest in the '"real"    Indian  as opposed to the old regime's idealization of Cuauhtemoc, the nephew    of Moctezuma who resisted Cortés  was necessarily related to peasant land seizures    and the peasantry as the foundation of the revolutionary troops that destroyed    the Porfirista army. Thus <i>indigenismo </i>was linked to agrarianism, officially    part of the revolutionary ideology after the approval of the 1917 constitution,    which legalized land reform (Hennessey, 1969: 42) ,<a name="not29"></a><a href="#29not"><sup>29</sup></a>    In the 1920's <i>indigenismo </i>also had an impact among intellectuals in Peru,    of whom Mariátegui was only one, and <i>indigenistas </i>there were able to    obtain the institutionalization of the Indian community as a corporate landholder.    Yet only in Mexico were Indian peasants widely mobilized  and manipulated     as part of the political process by the 1920's.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This short survey    of ideas indicates that Latin Americans were rarely asking the questions posed    by eastern European intellectuals in the years before the First World War, and    more frequently after 1917: Does the capitalist mode of production prevail in    this country? Is there a "conquering bourgeoisie," or can one be created?    Do there exist unique local modes of production that interact with capitalism?    Can a reformist state create a capitalist economy? Communist leaders in the    1920's, it is true, began to pose these questions, but the issues would not    be addressed with a sense of urgency and investigated with sophistication in    Latin America until after the Second World War.<a name="not30"></a><a href="#30not"><sup>30</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Granted, not all    the social and economic ideas current in eastern Europe before the War were    applicable to Latin America. Since many countries in the latter region at the    time had relatively little surplus agricultural populations, most of the post-Chayanov    theorizing about dualism, disguised unemployment, and peasant economic rationality     so important in Romania  was not seen as directly relevant. In contrast to    their reception in eastern Europe, the works of Chayanov played no role in Latin    American economic thought in the 1920 's and 1930's, and the fact that they    were only then available in German and Russian was perhaps less important than    the fact that they did not seem pertinent to much of Latin American reality,    although in retrospect they seem relevant enough to "speasant" countries    like Peru and Mexico. Here the "technical" aspect of Chayanov's formal    economics may have constituted a barrier to diffusion in the Latin America of    the time.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the same, the    Latin American regimes and the prevailing liberal model that "justified"    them were being attacked from a variety of quarters by the 1920 's, as for example    in demands for state intervention in the social sphere and domestic economy,    or in the recognition of corporate property. The foreign trade model based on    comparative advantage may have been the most durable aspect of liberalism at    the ideological level, and its survival probably lessened the impact of "root    and branch" critiques of liberalism in general. As noted, many parts of    Latin America were profoundly and positively affected by Ricardian prescriptions    of export-driven growth. Argentina by 1929 had a per capita income approaching    that of Australia, and the real growth rate of its economy had been almost twice    that of Australia for 1900-29 (Diaz-Alejandro, 1970: 55-56).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The leader of the    Argentine Socialist Party and the first translator of <i>Capital </i>into Spanish,    the above-mentioned Juan B. Justo, opposed industrial protectionism as late    as the 1920's, because he accepted the role assigned to Argentina in the international    division of labor.<a name="not31"></a><a href="#31not"><sup>31</sup></a> Granted,    Argentina was the flagship of success before 1930. Those countries where the    export model was less successful, such as Peru, may, like Romania, have experienced    more intensive efforts to critique the liberal development model before the    Great Depression. Radical intellectuals like Peru's Manuel González Prada had    denounced "feudal latifundism" in the late nineteenth century. But    even in Peru and other countries with corporate peasantries, the liberal model    seemed relatively successful to dominant elites; moreover, the anti-liberal    discourse was not offered at a theoretical level that found acceptance among    Comintern or other European Marxists, or, in the case of those who championed    national industry, among neoclassically trained economists.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well into the twentieth    century, non-socialist theorists likewise made little headway against the thesis    of comparative advantage. A striking instance concerns a corollary of Ricardo's    doctrine, i.e., that there are "natural" and "artificial"    economic activities based on a country's factor endowments, and that "artificial"    industries should be discouraged because they result in a misallocation of resources.    In Brazil, for example, Joaquim Murtinho, the Brazilian minister of finance    (1898-1902), would do nothing for "artificial" industries in the financial    crisis of 1901-02, since equal treatment of all economic activities by the state    would amount, in his view, to "socialism" (Murtinho, n.d.: xiii).    such was the policy that governments of the region generally followed until    the latter 1930's or later; it was not a laissez-faire policy, however, since    such regimes provided direct and indirect support (e.g., through exchange-rate    deterioration) for their export industries and the interests behind them.<a name="not32"></a><a href="#32not"><sup>32</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Chile, nonetheless,    export-led growth, focusing on the nitrate boom before and after the War of    the Pacific, laid a foundation for a manufacturing sector, and a Chilean industrialists<sup>'</sup>    association appeared in 1883. This fact was less unusual than that some Chileans    favoring industrialization discovered and consistently propagated the ideas    of Friedrich List. List found his leading Chilean disciple between 1880 and    the First World War in the person of Malaquias Concha, who popularized List's    infant industry argument (see Concha, 1889: 327-28; 1910).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">List was known    elsewhere, but seems to have had little influence,<a name="not33"></a><a href="#33not"><sup>33</sup></a>    and we may say that the central tendency before the Second World War was that    Latin American manufacturers and their ideologues were apologetic, timid, and    accomodationist  in sharp contrast, for example, to their Romanian counterparts    in this period. In the 1920's, Brazilian industrialists advanced "practical"    arguments: that industry would provide urban employment; that it would save    on foreign exchange (through import substitution); that it would help agriculture    by consuming local inputs (such as cotton); and that it would provide government    with more reliable sources of revenue (through consumption taxes) than the export    sector could (Sáenz Leme, 1978: 161).<a name="not34"></a><a href="#34not"><sup>34</sup></a>    Latin American industrialists and their spokesmen sought a place in the sun    <i>alongside </i>the traditional export activities. This was true of Alejandro    Bunge and Luis Colombo in Argentina; Roberto Simonsen, Alexandre Siciliano,    Jr. and Otávio Pupo Nogueira in Brazil; it was much less true of Malaquias Concha,    the Listian ideologue in Chile (Bunge, 1928-30; Colombo, 1931: 25, 27; 1933:    37; 1940: 3; Simonsen, n.d.: 6; Pupo Nogueira, 1931: 91-112; Siciliano, 1931:    18).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Almost no one in    the 1920's who sought to develop Latin America along capitalist lines viewed    export-driven growth as a problem requiring fundamental rethinking, as would    the Argentine economist Raul Prebisch by the early 1940's. One of the few who    tried to explain persistently negative balances of payments and deteriorating    terms of trade for 1914-21 was Víctor Emilio Estrada, the director of Ecuador's    central bank. Estrada anticipated an element in the famous Prebisch thesis of    1949namely, that Latin America's terms of trade for its traditional exports    would deteriorate indefinitely. (That is, for a given quantity of imports, Latin    American countries would have to supply an ever-larger amount of exports.) Specifically,    Estrada, like Prebisch in a more systematic way in the 1940's, attributed the    price-scissors problem principally to rising labor costs in manufacturing in    the United States (his nation's main trading partner). This fact owed to trade-union    activity, a pressure that was lacking in the price-formation of Latin American    goods, which were chiefly agricultural. But Estrada did not generalize beyond    his own country, and was only groping for measures to offset the falling prices    of cacao, Ecuador's leading export at the time (Estrada, 1922:77)'.<a name="not35"></a><a href="#35not"><sup>35</sup></a>    Estrada apparently had no influence on Prebisch or the structuralist school    the Argentine economist founded at the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America    (ECLA).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A more likely candidate    for such a role as precursor of ECLA was Manoilescu, the Romanian economist,    politician, and ideologue of corporatism, who    recommended industrialization <i>à outrance </i>for agricultural-exporting countries.    In Sao Paulo, Brazil, officials of the Center of Industries corresponded with    Manoilescu, and published <i>Théorie du protectionnisme </i>in Portuguese in    1931. In the early 1930 's three important industrial spokesmen in São Paulo     Roberto Simonsen, Alexandre Siciliano Jr., and Otávio Pupo Nogueira  took    the Romanian's work to be proof of the legitimacy of their interests. Adding    a touch of racism, Siciliano neatly adapted Manoilescu's theory, contending    in 1931 that Brazil could not continue to rely on traditional exports, because    of the lower wages that Africans and Asians would accept in competing agricultural    activities, implicitly raising their labor productivities; thus agriculture    in Brazil did not possess any intrinsic superiority to industry (cited in Pupo    Nogueira, 1931:133; on Manoilescu, 3, 131; Siciliano, 1931:12, 62; Simonsen,    n.d.: 58). Like Manoilescu and others in Romania, the three Brazilians also    tried to parry the charge of "artificiality" by pointing to the apparent    legitimacy of the coffee-roasting industry in the United States and the sugar-refining    industry in England, for which domestic raw materials did no exist. (Pupo Nogueira,    1931: 136; Siciliano, 1931:27-28; Simonsen, n.d.:88).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Manoilescu's prestige    as an economist was complemented by his reputation as a theorist of corporatism.    As in the case of Marxism, the literature on corporatism in French had a much    larger impact than that in German. Othmar Spann and the Sombart of <i>Deutscher    Soziatismus </i>were almost unknown, and the most influential writers were probably    Francois Perroux, who had taught at São Paulo, and Manoilescu.<a name="not36"></a><a href="#36not"><sup>36</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Manoilescu's attitudes    may have been as influential as his social ideas, at least among the industrialists    who first championed him. They welcomed his unabashed elitism, his support of    industrialization, his emphasis on the role of the state in the economy, and    his insistence on the close link between nationalism and industrial development.    The ideologues of Vargas' authoritarian Estado Novo (1937-45)  Azevedo Amaral,    Oliveira Vianna, and Francisco Campos  wanted a strong state, "rationalization"    of the economy (chiefly cartelization), and economic planning (Diniz &amp; Boschi,    1978:59; Vieira, 1981:27-70).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As in the case    of his vogue as social sage, Manoilescu's economic theories as a "scientific"    rationale for Brazilian industrialization did not survive the 1930's  chiefly    because of the attacks by Jacob Viner and other neoclassical theorists on his    work.<a name="not37"></a><a href="#37not"><sup>37</sup></a> Manoilescu's ideas    were slowly abandoned for more practical and circumstantial arguments. Simonsen,    who had frequently cited Manoilescu in the early 1930's, had ceased referring    to the master by the Second World War. In the debate between Simonsen and Eugênio    Gudin on economic planning in 1945, it was Gudin, not Simonsen, who referred    to Manoilescu, viewing him as a discredited charlatan (Simonsen &amp; Gudin,    1977: 108-09). Meanwhile, in 1944, Simonsen presided at an industrialists' congress    which called for the "harmonious" development of agriculture and industry,    and championed government aid to agriculture (Congresso Brasileiro da Industria,    1945:1. 225-26).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the general    absence of theoretical foundations for industrial development, for those Latin    American countries that had made industrial advances in the 1920 's, increased    self-sufficiency in the 1930's was a "second-best" option, in view    of the sustained crisis in export markets.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over the decade    of the 1930's, industrial spokesmen grew bolder, except perhaps those Brazilians    who had had initially followed Manoilescu. Note, for example, the themes chosen    by Luis Colombo, the president of the Unión Industrial Argentina: In 1931, he    supports a moderate and "rational" protectionism, and defends the    manufacturers against the charge of promoting policies inimical to the interests    of Argentine consumers; in 1933, he even-handedly justifies protection for both    industry and agriculture; and by 1940 he attacks the industrial countries as    having themselves violated the rules of the international division of labor    by developing large agricultural establishments, only choosing to buy abroad    when convenient (1931; 1933; 1940).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the 1930's,    industrialists pointed to the vulnerability of export economies, which they    more frequently dubbed "colonial" in the process. Governments, however,    moved hesitantly and inconsistently toward addressing the problems of industry.    In 1933 the Argentine Minister of Agriculture, Luis Duhau, proclaimed the necessity    of producing industrial goods that could no longer be imported (for lack of    foreign exchange), and he pledged his government's support for the process.    Yet in the same month the Argentine government supported the U.S. initiative    for general tariff reductions at the Pan American Union Conference in Montevideo.    Furthermore, as late as 1940, Finance Minister Pinedo's plan for the economic    development of Argentina still distinguished between "natural" and    "artificial"industries, implying further that industrial development    would occur in concert with the needs of the agricultural and pastoral sector    (Argentine Industrial Exhibition, 1933; Villanueva, 1975: 78).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In depression-era    Brazil, dictator Getulio Vargas was proindustry... Was he not the friend of    all established economic interests? But he opposed "artificial" industries    (manufacturing) in his presidential campaign in 1930, and government loans to    "artificial" industries were still prohibited in 1937. Osvaldo Aranha,    Vargas's Minister of Finance in 1933, even termed industries "fictitious"    if they did not use at least 70% domestic raw materials (Vargas, 1938: 26-27).<a name="38not"></a><a href="#not38"><sup>38</sup></a>    The contrast of these official attitudes with those in Romania is striking,    since Finance Minister Costinescu defended industries with imported inputs as    early as 1902 (Thery, 1904: 67).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vargas only became    committed to rapid industrial expansion during his Estado Novo dictatorship    (1937-45). Although he said he could not accept the idea of Brazil s remaining    a "semi-colonial" economy in 1939, as late as 1940, when the coffee    market was still depressed after a decade of attempts to revive it, Vargas wanted    to "balance" industrial and agricultural growth. Only in 1941 did    a division for industrial development of the Bank of Brazil begin to make significant    loans.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Mexico, industrialization    in the 1930's made modest advances while agrarian reform was at the top of the    Cárdenas government's agenda; during the War the pace quickened. Nacional Financiera,    a partly government-owned development bank, was established in 1934, but only    became seriously committed to manufacturing after its reorganization at the    end of 1940, when the new pro-industry administration of Ávila Camacho took    office. Protectionism in Mexico, according to one authority, "begins in    earnest with the Second World War" (Villareai, 1976: 43-45; Blair, 1964:    210, 213; Izquierdo, 1964: 243 &#91;quotation&#93;; Navarrete, 1967: 119).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Chile, the Popular    Front government of Pedro Aguirre Cerda proclaimed the need for state-sponsored    support for industry in 1939, and Aguirre established CORFO, the government    development corporation. But relief and reconstruction following an earthquake    that year was another reason for creating CORFO; in 1940 the sum budgeted for    the development of manufacturing was less than each of those for agriculture,    mining, energy, and public housing (Presidente de la República, 1940: 21-22,    95).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Argentina, Raúl    Prebisch was one of the government planners of the 1930's who gradually convinced    himself of the need to abandon export specialization as the primary engine of    economic growth. As director of the Central Bank from its inception in 1935,    Prebisch began to formulate his theories of unequal exchange between center    and periphery. He assumed a greater rate of technological innovation in industrial    countries, and argued that there were different responses to recessions by primary    exporters and those exporting manufactures, because of the power of organized    labor to maintain high Wages, and therefore high export prices, in the latter.    These propositions were not fully worked out until the latter 1940's, and were    in part based on U.N. terms of trade data available only after the War. The    question of how much Prebisch owed to Manoilescu was raised by Jacob Viner,    the neoclassical trade theorist, a year after Prebisch's "manifesto"    of 1949, <i>The Economic Development of Latin America and its Principal Problems.    </i>It seems probable, however, that Prebisch's ideas followed a different route    to similar conclusions about the international trading system and the urgency    of industrialization in underdeveloped countries (Viner, 1952: 61-64; Love,    1980a; 1980-86). Nonetheless, Manoilescu's .theses in the 1930's must have created    a sympathetic audience for Prebisch's views in the postwar era, and one of Manoilescu's    major essays was published in Chile as late in 1947. It appeared in <i>Econom&iacute;a,    </i>a journal of the University of Chile later edited by Aníbal Pinto, one of    ECLA's outstanding economists (Manoilescu, 1947).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At all events,    the fact that Latin American policymakers clung to the ideology of free trade    throughout the Great Depression seems to illustrate how slowly received ideas    die. The international trading system was in crisis over the whole period 1930-45,    but only at the end of the 1940's did ideological shifts flow from the observed    fact that, in Argentina and Chile, industry's share of the national product    was greater than agriculture's. Mexico and Brazil would soon follow.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Admittedly, Latin    American nations seemed to have more to lose than did eastern European countries    before the Great Depression. Romania, for instance, reacting to the agricultural    protectionism of central and western Europe, had begun efforts to industrialize    as early as 1886. Almost simultaneously that country was threatened by more    efficient grain producers "overseas," among which was Argentina, as    the Romanian publicist Petru Aurelian noted in 1890 (1890: 21).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another thing the    Latin American proponents of industrialization lacked, at least compared to    their eastern European contemporaries between the World Wars, was the strategic    argument  of great import in Romania, for example, a country that had doubled    its territory at the expense of its neighbors at the end of the First World    War. In the Western Hemisphere a Pax Americana had suceeded a Pax Britannica    during the 1890's; thus Chile, Argentina, and Brazil never became combatants    against each other after the downfall of the Argentine dictator Rosas in 1852,    when Brazilian troops fought on Argentine soil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Latin America,    industrialization was fact before it was government policy, and policy before    it was theory. Contrary to the views of Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who held that superstructural    changes in "local" or peripheral societies precede changes in the    material base, here is apparently a classical instance of a material transformation    preceding the change in ideological superstructure  although it should be clear,    from previous references to the importance of the absence or the phasing of    some ideas and institutions on the development of others, that the argument    is something other than economic reductionism. And it is true that no matter    how committed Latin Amercan governments might have been to the international    trading system, government policy was sometimes incoherent or accommodationist    for established interests, including industrialists. Still, before the 1940's,    industrialization had few intellectual champions, though some other aspects    of liberal ideology had been challenged much earlier.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When a theoretical    justification of industrialization appeared in 1949, the Argentine economy would    scarcely have been recognizable to intellectuals of Sarmiento's generation.    They had advanced a liberal project, if not a bourgeois one. Prebisch and ECLA    would reverse that emphasis, in effect inveighing against imperialism without    abandoning capitalism.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>REFERENCES</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Academia de Stiinte    Sociale si Politice (1972).

Love,    professor de História da Universidade de Illinois (EUA) e professor visitante    do IEA no período de 1989/90.    <br>   <a name="back1"></a><a href="#top1">*</a> Também publicado na <i>Review </i>do    "Fernand Braudel Center" (E.U.A), à qual agradeço a autorização para    republicar este texto.    <br>   (<a name="1not"></a><a href="#not1">1</a>) Nonetheless, these estates were highly    differentiated across the region as to the modernity of their technology, business    practices, and labor relations.    <br>   (<a name="2not"></a><a href="#not2">2</a>) In neighboring Peru, as late as 1920,    the government introduced corvée labor (<i>conscriptión vial</i>) for    the Indian population (Bauer, 1986:177).    <br>   (<a name="3not"></a><a href="#not3">3</a>) Few now accept the view associated    with Sergio Bagú, Caio Prado, Jr., and André Gunder Frank that a sempiternal    capitalism characterized Latin America from the Conquest onward; one reason    for rejecting this interpretation is that it does not allow for a <i>transition    </i>to capitalism (see Duncan &amp; Rutledge, 1977: 4-5).    <br>   (<a name="4not"></a><a href="#not4">4</a>) For a summary of the debate on the    Brazilian case, on which the literature is largest, see Love (1980b: 53-61).    <br>   (<a name="5not"></a><a href="#not5">5</a>) In 1911 Brazil exported 38,500 tons    of rubber; by 1930, it only exported 6,000 tons (Dean, 1986:695). As Dean notes,    it is remarkable that Brazil, a country of continental proportions, should become    dependent on a single crop, coffee, for three-fourths its export earnings in    the latter 1920's (1986:695-96).    <br>   (<a name="6not"></a><a href="#not6">6</a>) There was less import substitution    industrialization in other parts of Latin America (Diaz-Alejandro, 1970:12).    <br>   (<a name="7not"></a><a href="#not7">7</a>) In the postwar era, note, for example,    the impact of the essays <i>The Economic Development of Latin America and its    Principal Problems </i>by Raúl Prebisch (considered below; United Nations,    1950), and <i>Dependency </i>and<i> Development in Latin America </i>by Fernando    Henrique Cardoso and Enzo Faletto (1979, first published in 1969), the most    widely-cited and reprinted statement on dependency.    <br>   (<a name="8not"></a><a href="#not8">8</a>) Something of a proto-intelligentsia    can be found in the Latin American student movement, which began with a manifesto    at Argentina's University of Córdoba in 1918, and spread within four years as    far north as Cuba and Mexico. The Córdoba Manifesto, directed at "the free    men of America," called for the democratization of the university system    in the following ways: compulsory class attendance was to be abolished; there    was to be no limit on the number of times a student could fail a course; tuition    fees were to be terminated; the university was to function as a sanctuary for    political activists against reactionary governments; and students were to be    equally represented with professors and graduates on governing councils of universities.    <br>   Though these reforms were intended to bring the sons of workers and peasants    the benefits of higher education, in fact they only opened the lecture halls    to the middle classes. The bottleneck of secondary education, dominated by private    schools, remained the insuperable barrier for the children of the lower classes.    Over time, especially in those countries where the universities, like other    institutions, were weak (such as Cuba and Peru), the professional student appeared.    But prior to 1930. or even 1945, there were relatively so few university graduates    that only a small number of educated unemployables existed.    <br>   (<a name="9not"></a><a href="#not9">9</a>) Gamio studied anthropology at Columbia    University with Franz Boas. I do not wish to exaggerate the difference between    Romania and Latin America in this regard; the two Romanians who receive the    most attention below, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Mihail Manoilescu, did    not hold doctorates. But they debated men who did, which fact surely affected    the level of discourse.    <br>   (<a name="10not"></a><a href="#not10">10</a>) Molina Enriquez was a reformer    facing a revolutionary situation. Written in 1909, one year before the outbreak    of the Mexican Revolution, his book was legalistic in approach, and his denunciations    of the latifundium included the evils of absenteeism and low productivity decried    by the eighteenth-century Sapnish <i>philosopbe </i>Gaspar Jovellanos, whom    Molina cites. Molina displays an ambivalence toward foreign capital, and sees    it as less sinister than the creole faction (those descended from "pure"    Spaniards). While urging land reform, he concurred with the científicos(establishrnent    positivists) in defending the Díaz dictatorship. Molina did so because he believed    the regime was appropriate for Mexico given its state of evolution at the time,    despite the fact that much of the concentration of property had occured through    Diaz's efforts to alienate public lands and village commons (1909: 90,313,346).    <br>   (<a name="11not"></a><a href="#not11">11</a>) On the association of liberalism    and xenophobia in Romania, see Chirot (1976:108).    <br>   (<a name="12not"></a><a href="#not12">12</a>) They continued even later in Colombia,    where the final Liberal reaction came in the War of a Thousand Days, 1899-1902,    in which 100,000 people may have died.    <br>   (<a name="13not"></a><a href="#not13">13</a>) On Spencer's influence in Brazil,    see Graham (1968:232-51). Spencer's long-term influence, however, given his    strong emphasis on individualism and hostility to the state, was probably less    important than that of Comte, whose values were more in tune with the Latin    American ethos. (Personal communication from Charles A. Hale.)    <br>   (<a name="14not"></a><a href="#not14">14</a>) In citing Kautsky, Stere did not    mention that the former remained an orthodox Marxist, and showed in <i>The Agrarian    Question how </i>capitalism had revolutionized agriculture, albeit in more complex    ways than industry. This fact owed, in part, to the phenomenon of (non-capitalist)    ground rent and the peasant's willingness to engage in superexploitation of    his own and his family's labor. Publishing in 1899, the same year as Lenin's    <i>The Development of Capitalism in Russia</i> appeared, Kautsky believed the    vast majority of German peasants were already proletarians or semiproletarians    selling labor power.    <br>   (<a name="15not"></a><a href="#not15">15</a>) The Junimea was a cultural and    political grouping founded at lasi (Jassy) in 1863 by Titu Maiorescu and others    who had studied abroad, principally in Germany. (Maiorescu, who had studied    at Berlin, Paris, and Giessen, held a doctorate from the University of Vienna.)    The Junimea argued that Romania had not attained a state of development corresponding    to its adoption of Western institutions, and that the (failed) revolution of    1848 against the Turkish Empire had not been the result of real aspirations    of the country. Maiorescu was deeply influenced by Hegel on the evolution of    culture, and, like the German philosopher, believed that institutions such as    the state could not change the organic "base," i.e., society; rather,    change had to flow from the latter (See "Junimea," 1964:935-36, and    Academia de Stiinte Sociale si Politice, <i>Istoria Filozofia Românesti, </i>1972:1,353-96.    <br>   (<a name="16not"></a><a href="#not16">16</a>) A similar idea was first expressed    by Marx regarding the Germany of the 1860's (1961:1,9), and echoed by Lenin    with respect to the Russia of the 1890's (1956: 659).    <br>   (<a name="17not"></a><a href="#not17">17</a>) Kautsky in 1899 had implicitly    touched on, but had not developed, the articulation of capitalist and precapitalist    modes of production.    <br>   (<a name="18not"></a><a href="#not18">18</a>) As Cristian Racovski noted in    1909, peasants had to sign formal contracts, a characteristic feature of capitalist    labor relations, but such contracts included stipulations for the payment of    feudal dues (1909:10-11).    <br>   (<a name="19not"></a><a href="#not19">19</a>) Cf. Racovski's similar analysis    in " Chestia Agrara: Probleme si Soluti" (1907: 40-41).    <br>   (<a name="20not"></a><a href="#not20">20</a>) Notably, Stefan Zeletin and Mihail    Manoilescu in the 1920's.    <br>   (<a name="21not"></a><a href="#not21">21</a>) Sir Reginald Hoarc to Foreign    Office, 21 June 1940, FO 371,24992, Public Record Office, London.    <br>   (<a name="22not"></a><a href="#not22">22</a>) Notably, Bertil Ohlin and Jacob    Vincr. Ohlin criticized Manoilescu's assumptions. Why should the average productivity    of all national industries be considered representative of that of the export    industries? What justified the assumption that the price level of factors is    everywhere equal, when it was known that money wages in the United States were    more than ten times higher than in Romania? Why did Manoilescu only consider    labor productivity in his calculations, and ignore capital and land? Ohlin's    "fundamental criticism" was that, in addition to assuming factors    of production can move from activities with low productivities to those with    high productivities, Manoilescu also assumed that protection causes the transfer.    But why, Ohlin asked, did this transfer not occur <i>without </i>protection,    since price signals should favor the industries with higher productivities (1931:    34-36)? Viner made similiar criticisms in his review of Manoilescu's book (1932:122,125).    <br>   (<a name="23not"></a><a href="#not23">23</a>) In philosophy, neo-idealism found    an effective proponent in the Argentinian Alejandro Korn.    <br>   (<a name="24not"></a><a href="#not24">24</a>) For example, the philosopher José    Gaos, the sociologist José Medina Echavarría, and the economist José Urbano    Guerrero all resided in Mexico in the late 1930's and early 1940's. To be sure,    Latin American readers of Ortega's <i>Revista de Occidente </i>were aware    of German thought, and many Spanish intellectuals had visited Latin America    before the Civil War. Ortega, a neo-Kantian, had lectured in Buenos Aires in    1916 and 1929 (<i>Exilio Español en México, </i>1982:814,868,975; Romero, 1983:128,134).    <br>   In our own day some German language classics are available in Spanish, but not    English; still others appeared in Spanish before their publication in English.    Major studies by Werner Sombart, Henryk Grossman, Karl Kautsky, and Fritz Sternberg    have been published in Spanish, but still await their English editions. Both    Weber's <i>Economy and Society and </i>Hilferding's <i>Finance </i>Capital appeared    in Spanish first.    <br>   (<a name="25not"></a><a href="#not25">25</a>) Anderson notes a new generation    of French intellectuals entering the PCF in 1928, but perceives no "generalization    of Marxism as a theoretical currency in France" until the German occupation    (1976:37).    <br>   (<a name="26not"></a><a href="#not26">26</a>) As noted, "peasantists"    like Madgearu and corporatists like Manoilescu also drew on Hilferding.    <br>   (<a name="27not"></a><a href="#not27">27</a>) On the relatively early appearance    of Marxism in Argentina, see Ratzer (1969).    <br>   (<a name="28not"></a><a href="#not28">28</a>) Gerschenkron argues that populism    shaped Russian Marxism, the opposite of Walicki's thesis, but the two writers    have different phases in mind for these long and intimately related movements    (Gerschenkron, 1966: 190).    <br>   (<a name="29not"></a><a href="#not29">29</a>) To me it seems more appropriate    to use Ionescu's term "peasantism" than "populism" to describe    peasant political mobilization, as Henessy does (1969:40).    <br>   (<a name="30not"></a><a href="#not30">30</a>) Outside the Communist parties    of the region, other voices attacked British and American imperialism, notably    Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre in Peru, and radicals of the Mexican Revolution,    such as the anarchist Ricardo Flores Magón.    <br>   (<a name="31not"></a><a href="#not31">31</a>) Justo was not even a Marxist.    He considered Marx's theory of surplus value "an ingenious allegory"    (quoted in Ratzer, 1981:34).    <br>   (<a name="32not"></a><a href="#not32">32</a>) Paying their costs in local currency    and receiving "hard" currencies for their exports, such groups profited    by obtaining more local currency as its exchange value fell. An unintended byproduct    of this exchange policy was a degree of protection for national manufactures,    but this effect was partly offset by higher costs of capital imports.    <br>   (<a name="33not"></a><a href="#not33">33</a>) E.g., List was cited in the Argentine    tariff debates of 1875-76, but the episode had no significant effect on Argentina's    "open economy" orientation (Chiaramonte, 1971:136).    <br>   (<a name="34not"></a><a href="#not34">34</a>) More aggressive arguments, e.g.    those challenging the artificiality of Brazilian manufacturing, had been advanced    by the Centro Industrial do Brasil in 1904-05, but to little effect (see Carone,    1977: 8-9).    <br>   (<a name="35not"></a><a href="#not35">35</a>) I thank Paul W. Drake for bringing    this work to my attention.    <br>   (<a name="36not"></a><a href="#not36">36</a>) In addition to Manoilescu and    Perroux, Gaetan Pirou and Sergio Pannunzio also influenced Brazil's leading    theorist of corporatism, Francisco Oliveira Vianna (Vieira, 1981: 31).    <br>   (<a name="37not"></a><a href="#not37">37</a>) Additional possible causes of    Manoilescu's unfashionability were his open adherence to fascism in the latter    1930's and his support for Germany in the Second World War.    <br>   (<a name="not38"></a><a href="#38not">38</a>) O <i>Estado de </i>S. Paulo,8    March 1933 (Aranha quotation). Interestingly, the artificiality charge came    from the left as well. Cab Prado, Jr., Brazil's leading Communist intellectual    of his generation, condemned the restrictive practices of Brazilian industrialists    in 1935 as an indication of the artificiality of manufacturing, which lacked    a mass market. It was necessary to create such a market through the redistribution    of wealth before industry could thrive, he believed (1933:128,133-35).</font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

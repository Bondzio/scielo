ABSTRACT The present study conducted a systematic review of the literature on sexuality education in Brazilian schools, in order to identify its main characteristics, topics addressed and professionals involved. The research resulted in 24 empirical articles published between 2010-2016, obtained from Educ@, Science Direct, MEDLINE, LILACS and SciELO databases. It was determined that the actions reviewed do not meet the recommendations of the Par√¢metros Curriculares Nacionais [National Curricular Parameters] regarding the mainstreaming of the theme. It is important to emphasize the need to extend this debate and to invest in teacher training with a view to transforming discriminatory sexual patterns and promoting a culture of prevention in health in the school environment.

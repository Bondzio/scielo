Abstract The expansion of the frontiers of sexual citizenship driven by feminist and sexual diversity movements gave rise (paradoxically) to the configuration of a religious citizenship. The main purpose of this article is to analyze this configuration in order to understand the politics of conservative Catholic activism in contemporary democracies. In particular, three dimensions of religious citizenship are proposed: the redrawing of identity borders, the mobilization of beliefs and the recognition of religious rights. Each of these dimension illuminates different (though interconnected) aspects of the Catholic Church policy in reaction to the real and imagined challenges imposed by the recognition of sexual and reproductive rights.

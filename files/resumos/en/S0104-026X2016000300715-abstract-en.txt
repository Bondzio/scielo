Abstract: From a comparison between pornography and sexology discourses, this article explores issues about many sexuality manifestations on culture, the development of erotic scripts, and operations through which sex is materialized through regimes of truth production . . Although it may seem unusual, we suggest that both examples are forms of sexual knowledge that share references and means of action, inciting us to think about the distinction of some gender norms, and contemporary interpretations about the production of the materiality of sex.

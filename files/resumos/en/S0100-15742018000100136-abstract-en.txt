ABSTRACT: Today, education is challenged by the increasing heterogeneity of contemporary society. Therefore, preparing young people for the experience of sharing different cultural traditions becomes a more and more important task. Based on the comparison of the concepts of the exotic and the strange, the author emphasizes the concept of alterity as an indication that points out the necessary pedagogical posture to fulfill this task: to recognize the right of the other to be different and to be responsible for their sociocultural integration. Thus, the relation of alterity reaffirms the eminently ethic connotation of the educational purpose and the field of education as a field of social experience. It is between the extremes of objective professionalism and subjective affection that the relation of alterity contributes to the construction of a socially productive space.

From the perspective of Karl Mannheim's sociology of knowledge, it is possible to understand the state of the art of poverty studies in Guatemala between 1980 and 2004. This work is justified by the lack of investigations looking into the development of Social Sciences in Guatemala and it demonstrates its importance through theoretical and methodological experiences. Investigation on poverty can be said to have been neither systematic nor continued, due to the social and political process the country has undergone. Nevertheless, it can also be sustained that there is a heterogeneous and considerable bibliographic corpus between 1980-2004. This investigation aimed at a taking stock of the theoretical and methodological trends of the studies in the last 20 years. I shall point out that bibliography on poverty is quite broad and a selection of a sample of the most representative works was inevitable, not only in the decades examined, but also in terms of the issues. It is not possible to understand poverty studies detached from Social Sciences and historical, political, economic, and social processes of Guatemala and their relation to other fields of knowledge in Central America and Latin America.

Abstract The present article reflects upon the concepts of work and womens&#8217; work in the light of classic Marxist feminist analyses. It seeks to problematize these categories, beginning with a conversation that took place during ethnographic fieldwork, thinking about what sex work means within the historical a current context of the market for women&#8217;s labor. We situate sex work as a variant of reproductive work which still provokes great controversy among significant portions of &#8220;progressive&#8221; social movements and also among conservative religious sectors, complicating its recognition as a legitimate occupation. We explore some of the possible reasons why sex work, almost alone among the traditional reproductive labor &#8220;done out of love&#8221;, still generates so much discomfort among such heterogeneous political and social groups.

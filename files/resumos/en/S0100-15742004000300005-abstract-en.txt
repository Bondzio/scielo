What are the jobs typically held by masters and doctors trained in Brazil? How do they perceive the relevance of research training to their professional activities? This article attempts to provide answers to these questions, based on data from a previous study and, in view of the evidence gathered, discusses aspects of policies for graduate education. The original study interviewed 8,7 thousand masters and doctors who obtained their graduate degrees during the nineties, in 15 fields of knowledge, from universities located in different regions (all except the North) of Brazil. These data were aggregated into three groups or great fields of knowledge, allowing a new analytical perspective. In all groups, jobs held by masters are quite diverse and teaching in higher education usually is not the major occupation; as far as doctors are concerned, their professional activities are concentrated in the academy. Graduates frequently have positive perceptions on their research training, but masters who do not work in the academy typically have less favorable perceptions than university professors and researchers; among PhDs, however, similar differences are observed in only one of the groups studied. The evidence gathered thus suggests, for a number of fields, that models of graduate education would benefit from additional approaches to those currently adopted.

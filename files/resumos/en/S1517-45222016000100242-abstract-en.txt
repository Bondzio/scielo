Science, technology and innovation (STI) policies usually refer to economic growth and competitiveness as its main objectives. In this article, I argue that in recent years conceptual frameworks in STI policies have emerged that discuss the adequacy of conventional policies to situations characterized by specific social challenges. These new frameworks give greater importance to social objectives rather than economic goals. I introduce three approaches that share this premise: (a) orientation to "grand challenges", (b) Responsible research and innovation for emerging technologies and (c) innovation for social inclusion. In turn, I analyze whether these frameworks imply a shift away from generic economic objectives (a "post-competitive" turn). Finally, I conclude that we cannot speak of a coherent and systematic alternative framework but there is nevertheless a shared awareness of the limitations of conventional STI policies to address social issues where the economic return is not evident.

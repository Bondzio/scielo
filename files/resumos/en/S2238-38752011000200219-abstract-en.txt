Abstract: While describing cordel, CÃ¢mara Cascudo attributes its poetic function to the capacity of "photographing", that is, of presenting an imagery through words. From Cascudo's intuiton, the paper tries to show the strength of image produced by rhyme in cordel that allows the listener-reader to imagine and grasp other worlds presented by the poet. Starting from this question I reflect upon the poetics of cordel demonstrating that the affective and cognitive dimension of image and trope are inseparable, building poetic and discursive style as something embodied in the very material nature of speech and communication.

Abstract This article derives from the theoretical and empirical development of the author's doctoral research on urban cultures and contemporary Portuguese music scenes, which sought to demarcate and interpret the dynamics underlying the genesis, constitution and functioning of the subfield of alternative rock in Portugal over the last 40 years. It focuses specifically on the cultural, artistic and musical fruition of the cities of Oporto and Lisbon over the last decade, observing dissimilarities, persistences and specificities. This study confirmed the emergence of a Portuguese youth framed in the sphere of aesthetic and playful cosmopolitanism, bearer of a cosmopolitan cultural capital - that is, a savoir-faire and savoir-vivre in the experimentation and enjoyment of cultural difference, through consumption and urban musical, artistic and cultural practices marked by hybridity and eclecticism.

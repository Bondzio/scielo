Despite the social and political changes in respect of transsexualities and tranvestilities, they are still considered by the APA (American Psychiatric Association) and by the WHO (World Health Organization) as mental disorders. These organizations will disclose in 2013 the new versions of the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - APA) and the ICD (International Code of Illness-WHO). This has mobilized trans activists claiming the withdrawal of transsexuality from the list of diseases considered as mental disorders. The Stop Trans Pathologization (Stop Pathologizing!) has become a global campaign, reaching 29 countries by early 2012. In this article, we will discuss some initiatives within this campaign and review the gender ideology present in the DSM and the ICD which incorporate the genre as a diagnostic category. Finally, we will present arguments against the gender diagnosis.

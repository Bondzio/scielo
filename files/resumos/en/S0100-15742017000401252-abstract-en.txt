ABSTRACT This text, organized in three parts, discusses the way in which the idea of school failure in Brazil was approached. In the first part, the author addresses the conditions under which studies about school failure in Brazil were conducted, paying attention to the historical sense of its use as an analytical tool. The second part examines some of the material that was produced about this issue, in the form of research or translation into Portuguese, in order to problematize the most common record of its history. The third part proposes that the mobilization of the population for education, around the years 1970/1980 in SÃ£o Paulo, is a relevant explanatory element. However, it lacks reflection on the elaboration of the notion of school failure as an analytical category in education.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse some relationships between freedom and school knowledge from historical-critical pedagogic theory, which is based on the Marxist view of history, society, the human being and knowledge. Freedom does not exist in nature, having appeared through specifically human activity, that is, through work. Social history has increased the possibilities of free action and, simultaneously, obstacles to the achievement of these possibilities. School education reflects, in its content and form, that contradictory character of the human struggle for freedom.

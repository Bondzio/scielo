This paper, by recalling aspects of the discussion that history has a memory, aims to point to some challenges related to studies based on the theory of social representations and its historicity. The discussions proposed here are based mainly on the work of Paul Ricoeur and on Brazilian and French historiographies to understand memory and history as a "system of the management of the past". Underlining some specificities of the current "historicity system" in which there is a fracture between "space of experience" and "horizon of expectation", some consequences on the public uses of memory and history are presented through brief mentions of the Brazilian military coup and the creation of the National Commission of Truth, which serve as a provocation to the approach of social representations.

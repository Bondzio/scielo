Abstract: Oliveira Vianna is a relevant exponent of Brazilian social and political thought and it is precisely for this reason that many studies seek to analyze the questions of his thinking or the roots of it. However, if it is easy to locate works dedicated to the analysis of the author and his theory, the same does not occur when our interest is researching the specificity of Vianna&#8217;s political activities between 1932 and 1940. In this article, I will present, punctually, Vianna's positions about the introduction of 3,000 Chinese in Brazil. He exposed them in a technical report sent by him, through the Ministry of Labor, Industry and Commerce, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This work helps us: 1) to amplify our understanding of Vianna's thought; 2) to highlight the specificity of his technical, juridical and political engagement. Finally, we find in this report a clear intersection between Oliveira Vianna as an intellectual and as a legal advisor.

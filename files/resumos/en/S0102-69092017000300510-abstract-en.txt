ABSTRACT This article is inserted in the global debate about the dynamics of alternative agro-food networks. The main objective of this study consists in analyzing the constitution and operation of the Gruppi di Acquisto Solidale (G.A.S), currently considered the most important experience of political consumption of Italy. This study is based on in-depth interviews held with various actors connected to this initiative (producers, consumers, technicians etc.). The focus is to demonstrate that it is not only a unique modality of buying and selling agro-food products, but of a broader movement that challenges the production, distribution and agro-food consumption mainstream in the whole planet. The contribution of this study is to stimulate the reflection about the importance of these processes as objects of sociological observation, among the effects caused by agro-food scandals in the actuality.

Converging point of distinct people such as the Tupinamb&#225;s Indians and African slaves from Nigeria, Benin, Angola and Congo, the S&#227;o Bartolomeu Park resists to the disordered growth of the city of Salvador. The special beauty of the place seems to have exerted a fascination over the Tupinamb&#225;s Indians, who founded a town there, abandoning their nomad habits. This place was also a schelter for the fugitive slaves that found there protection and help, organizing in 1826 the so-called "Quilombo do Urubu". The present paper discusses the historical and sacred importance of the S&#227;o Bartolomeu Park for the participants of the candombl&#233; sect and the religious syncretism deriving from the indian and African traditions. In many "terreiros de candombl&#233;" (place where the ritual is practiced) located near the S&#227;o Bartolomeu Park, the Indians divinities (caboclos) are side by side with the Africans (orix&#225;s). Interviews carried out with those who follow the candombl&#233; sect show that Tupinamb&#225;s and African slaves descendants are the major users of the S&#227;o Bartolomeu Park.

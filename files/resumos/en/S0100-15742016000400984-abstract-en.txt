Abstract This article presents a methodological approach which allows the researcher to work on the relationship between subject and object in research. This approach is called involvement analysis. This paper describes and analyzes how this approach was used in three educational projects at different stages of the research, in Argentina. We have analyzed the methodological procedure in each research project using a double hermeneutic process. This paper provides empirical evidence on three different possible functions of analysis of involvement: decision making, establishing a distance from the research subject to the object and knowledge construction.

Abstract The manuscript starts with the discussion on how globalization increased international mobility of doctors, regarding academic, political, social, and labor issues. Then, it shows an international overview of the main migratory movements of medical professionals. It highlights that the main fluxes are from poor regions to more affluent ones and from those to developed nations. Those countries, despite of presenting higher per capita numbers of doctors, present professional needs, especially due to the ageing of their populations and to distant locations, which are or non-attractive places to native undergraduate students. It ends up by discussing issues of equity in health around the world, health diplomacy, and ethical principles involved.

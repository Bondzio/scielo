This work shows the main aspects related to the meteorology linked to the process of turbulent dispersion of atmospheric pollutants. It is pointed out that meteorology is fundamental to air quality control, and meteorological events guide the pollutant dispersion and its deposition on the soil. Recent improvements on the description and forecast of the phenomena that involve atmospheric pollution, considering the population quality of life, are discussed.

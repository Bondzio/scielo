Abstract How has the literature been analyzing the Executive Branch in the different political regimes? From the basic institutional difference between presidentialism and parliamentarism we can identify two sets of major contributions to the understanding of the functioning of the Executive in democracies: the literature on the American presidency and discussions about coalition governments in European parliamentarianism. What these two sets of theories have in common is a concern with intra-executive politics. This literature is analyzed, identifying key issues, institutions, behaviors and emphasized variables. As a result we have the systematization and comparison of the main arguments about the internal workings of the Executive not only in presidentialism and parliamentarism, but also the contribution to the explanation of the specific case of coalition presidentialism.

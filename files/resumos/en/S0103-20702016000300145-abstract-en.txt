Abstract On behalf of the reflection on participation of women in the history of social sciences in Mexico, the phenomenon of invisibilization is proposed as the model of the annulment of women in the history of the different activities of public life. The exceptional recognition of some women in the cultural field has as a corollary the concealment of a multitude of professionals who helped advance the different disciplines. It is proposed to introduce the gender perspective into the history of the social sciences and show its continuous presence in the various spaces of knowledge and appropriation of knowledge and, in contrast, its absence both in the management positions and in the foundational moments records of the different disciplines they have contributed to forge.

Abstract:  Many family farmers linked to the agro-tourism association &#8220;Acolhida na Col√¥nia&#8221; (AC) produce a higher quantity of organic foods than they sell at the establishment. This article analyzes their orientation to the market, testing the hypothesis that their search for other possibilities of sale could take advantage of the relationship with consumers, adopting a relational marketing approach. We investigate their relation with the short circuits of commercialization (SCC), identifying the motivations and difficulties for their insertion in these circuits, differentiating them into clusters according to the market orientation practiced. We have identified that all are sensitive to forms of relationship marketing, but that they largely do not practice it. Within the different clusters, however, there are several farmers with sensitivity, experience and knowledge for a qualified bi-directional communication and goal-sharing with consumers.They could be the basis for an organizational strategy of relational marketing.

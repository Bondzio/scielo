Abstract: Based on theoretical and methodological assumptions of "Oral History" and "Personal Collection", this text analyzes protagonism of a group of female athletes while building one of the best teams of women's indoor soccer in Brazil in 2000. By forging a strategy network that invested in participation in social events, links to sponsors, creation and maintenance of pedagogical schools and by getting more media space, the athletes have placed themselves as individuals of that practice and, by doing so, problematized the classic representations of indoor soccer, whose meaning are permeated by masculinity marks. Whereas they tension gender crossing in sports, they invest in a meticulous watch process which is reflected normatively on their bodies and their behaviors.

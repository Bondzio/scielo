Abstract The article examines how a productive activity - the book market - acts as a unifying bond for a certain group. Centered on the figure of the book seller as the protagonist of this market, the paper explores the double matrix of the book-object, cultural and material, which ultimately sets a dubious structure within which both the promoter of culture and the dealer coexist. On the micro-sociological level, we seek to understand the tension at the vocational education between the know-how learned in their daily works (in a routine that reconstructs the master-apprentice model), and the academic learning. On the macro-sociological level, the changes in the way goods in general are sold and the reshaping of the reading habits impose the introduction of strategies of adaptation towards the new world of information. The study of this case allows us to explore the sociability of the group and the process of building a shared vision of the world outside the official spaces of vocational education.

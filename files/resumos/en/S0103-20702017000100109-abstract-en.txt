Abstract Based on an ethnography undertaken at the Brazilian antitrust agency, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (Cade), this article explains the agency&#8217;s need to identify competitive agents as part of its investigation into competition issues and describes the way this identification was undertaken in a recent corporate acquisition in the private higher education sector. This identification practice, common in antitrust cases related to &#8220;acts of concentration&#8221;, such as corporate mergers and acquisitions, is becoming more complex due to the increasing financialization of the economy, since several companies are interconnected through networks of corporate ownership and/or control that are not always explicit. This article describes some of the investigative procedures adopted in order to visualize and conceive a market competitor in this new context. Through this description, the author seeks to demonstrate how certain government knowledge practices &#8211; in this case those related to legal regulation of competition &#8211; produce economic agents, pointing to the existence of a diversity of forms of agencies that is not always taken into consideration in sociology or anthropology, but which nevertheless permeate and mold economic life..

Abstract Based on a critical reading of in-depth interviews, this article offers an analysis of the way in which trans and non-trans (or cis) femininities are performatively produced, through the repeated use of grammatical feminine gender in self-referential speech and through the use of a feminine name in their daily lives. At a time of profound social and cultural changes related to the recognition in 2012 of the gender identity of transgender people in Argentina (Law no26743), this article also examines the restrictive legal framework to give names as well as the social and historical particularities of trans names. Concepts from the theory of gender performativity developed by Judith Butler are used for this analysis, in dialogue with conceptualizations from the field of Transgender Studies.

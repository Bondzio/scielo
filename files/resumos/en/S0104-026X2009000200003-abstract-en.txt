Many cities may be found in one city: some of them are visible and some others are invisible, but all of them are produced in the heterotopic space of the (heterogenic and nomadic) other. The diverse ways of imagining the cities (from literature, cinema, music) allow to transgress the postpatriarchal cities, from a nomadic rhizomatic and transversal conception of feminism, and answer creatively and aesthetically to the cities which have been designed under the auspices of late capitalism: homogeneous, (in)different, non localized, male chauvinist (without identity, neither relationships, nor histories) places. When facing them, the figure of the other cities, of the multiplicity of the differences and singularities, of what has been cast aside, certainly sprouts: gender studies and their demands (sexual and nomadic cities), different, ambiguous, ambivalent, eccentric, wanting and heterotopic cities (with heterogeneous, changing and fractured spaces).

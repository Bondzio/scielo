In this paper we follow the trajectory of Eduardo, a cooperating student. The narrative is complemented by an analysis of the training conditions of police students from Mozambique in a Portuguese, as in the case of Eduardo, but also from Angola, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe. The cadets are trained in five or more years of (equivalent to a master degree) to become police officers in their countries of origin. We argue that these students integrate communities of knowledge where the learning pedagogy includes the image and example. Such communities are historically and contextually situated. Similarly, we describe how students in cooperative education in Portugal mobilize ideas of sacrifice and hope both associated with the experience placed on the expectation of return to their own countries.

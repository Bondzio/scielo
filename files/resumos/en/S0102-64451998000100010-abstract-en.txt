The medieval story of Tristan et Iseut is studied as a "roman de la désaffiliation ", with this last term designating a severance, an exclusion from social ties. Tristan and Isolde form a paradigmatic case of ties condemned to rupture. Between the lines there is a reading of "désaffiliation" processes in contemporary societies.

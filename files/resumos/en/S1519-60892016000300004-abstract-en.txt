Abstract This article analyzes the process that markes the origins of the Democratic Labor Party (PDT), a political party founded in Portugal by Leonel Brizola and other Brazilians in exile. The foundation of PDT leads us to reflect on the role that mandatory exile had on its leaders in regards to understanding the first decisions that defined the trajectory of the party. The research showed that the context in which the PDT was created &#8211; marked by the Portuguese re-democratization and the transnational context in which the exiled were inserted away from their original country &#8211; influenced its main leaders and the emergence of the so-called &#8220;brown socialism&#8221;.

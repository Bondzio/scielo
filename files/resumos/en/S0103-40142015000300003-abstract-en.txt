abstract This paper analyses the changes in the dynamics of the Brazilian labor market in the first half of 2015, a period of rising unemployment, a growing informal economy, precarious job stability and decreasing income - all movements contrary to those of the last decade. The text also recommends policies and measures to be taken to reverse the situation, and advocates the need to develop a transition path toward economic growth by means of increased domestic consumption, investments and the sharing of productivity gains.

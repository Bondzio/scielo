For the current science related to social movements and environmental issues it is usual the critical discussion of classical science reductionism, the dynamics of individualized work, the disconnection and the lack of integration with the real problems. As a result, the number of opinion in favor of a more integrated science grows. The National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) has developed a Research Groups Directory in Brazil. Some of these groups have a network model. It is important to evaluate the inherent capacity of these groups for influencing the formulation and implementation of environmental policies. We used the exploratory study based on the literature review focused on these groups. Among the results were identified key factors for strengthening influence on public policy which have stood out more interdisciplinary approaches. However, the groups had difficulties in using communication tools for more efficient networking and to reach decision makers. Some groups had difficulties in accessing funds and to join the groups.

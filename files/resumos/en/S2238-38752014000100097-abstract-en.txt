Abstract This article discusses the changes in the concept of territory as a privileged environment for the production of public action. In a context of globalization and environmentalization of conflicts, the territory becomes an object of socio-environmental claim for some of the so-called traditional populations, which enables them to value native knowledge, affirm a political identity, and assure with full legitimacy the control of their collective destiny. At the same time, in the field of the social sciences, the analysis of territory traditionally identified with History and Geography becomes an object of interest to Sociology and Political Sciences as well. That has resulted in a renovation of the territorial issue that serves as the basis for not only the economic, social, and cultural vision of the territory, but also for its political perspective.

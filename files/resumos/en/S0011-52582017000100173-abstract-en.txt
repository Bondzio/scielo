ABSTRACT The following article aims to investigate the narratives built by the Pentecostal-evangelical religious device in contexts of confinement in terms of the role they play in government tactics exercised by the prison service in Argentina. To do so, we analyze the techniques of social ordering assumed by church-pavilions, the spiritual/mundane cosmological division in the configuration of religious subjectivities and spaces in prison, and the discourses defining the Pentecostal narratives in confinement as forms of prosperity (whether medical, economic or penal). Taking two prisons in the province of Santa Fe as case studies, we conclude by seeking to understand the Pentecostal narratives in church-pavilions integrated with a government strategy that facilitates the management of the prisoner population, with this strategy based on correctionalist and paralyzing principles which reduce situations of conflict and define a prison service whose day-to-day functioning suffers from a lack of updates.

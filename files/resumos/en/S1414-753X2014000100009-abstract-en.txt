This survey investigates the environmental risk perception and the relationship with different actors, related to the tanning industry in the Sinos Valley region (Vale do Rio dos Sinos), Brazil. Such analysis lies in the constructivist theory, explaining how the Perceived Risk. Even though the focus of this survey focuses on a theoretical review of the theories of risk, it is based on collected data for a larger study, in which were applied 307 questionnaires and 32 interviews with different actors (workers, public administration, NGOs, neighbors and entrepreneurs). In relation to the risk perception, we will see that it is embedded in the social formation, historical and cultural community of the Sinos Valley. On the other hand, the local context emphasizes the dynamics of industrialization as the basis for progress. Thus, even identifying, in part, the risks, they are denied or silenced by the economic dependence (employment and income) of the industrial sector.

Abstract This article focuses on the way in which Eurocentric conceptualisations of the &#8216;international&#8217; are reproduced in different geopolitical contexts. Even though the Eurocentrism of International Relations has received growing attention, it has predominantly been concerned with unearthing the Eurocentrism of the &#8216;centre&#8217;, overlooking its varied manifestations in other geopolitical contexts. The article seeks to contribute to discussions about Eurocentrism by examining how different conceptualisations of the international are at work at a particular moment, and how these conceptualisations continue to reproduce Eurocentrism. It will focus on the way in which Eurocentric designations of spatial and temporal hierarchies were reproduced in the context of Turkey through a reading of how the &#8216;Gezi Park protests&#8217; of 2013 and &#8216;Turkey&#8217; itself were written into the story of the international.

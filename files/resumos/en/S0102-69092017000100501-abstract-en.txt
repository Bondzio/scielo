This article aims to discuss the possibilities of a critical sociology capable of dealing with the challenges of our time. Based on André Gorz&#8217;s concept of revolutionary reforms, I analyze some social-theoretical models. As references for this work, I rely on the theories of Axel Honneth, Nancy Fraser, Alain Caillé, and Boaventura de Sousa Santos. The analysis is developed on the basis of three ideas which permit us to find in these theories a unifying denominator: the search for an inter-subjective approach; a normative emphasis guided by the need to find ways of living together, despite our differences; and a political search for non-extremist forms of social changes, which can be defined as &#8216;via media&#8217;. These ideas may allow us to delineate the main characteristics of a critical sociology adequate to the challenges of our time as well as to highlight the contributions these theorists give to critical sociology.

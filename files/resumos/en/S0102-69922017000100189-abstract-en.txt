Abstract Social movement activists face a dilemma in their framing activities. According to part of the literature, moral imperatives are constraints to strategic imperatives and this dilemma emerges from the tension between these poles. This paper has two objectives: (1) to question and to propose alternatives to the dichotomous characterization of the framing dilemma; (2) and to comprehend the processes that generate different solutions for this dilemma. To achieve these goals, we interviewed: leaders of four animal rights organizations of Porto Alegre; a leader of one organization of SÃ£o Paulo; and activists and journalists involved in the production of news reports and articles selected for deeper analysis. Our data shows that moral and strategic imperatives are complementary and are generated by folk theories on social transformation and by interactive pressures, generating different solutions for the framing dilemma.

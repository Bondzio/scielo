Abstract: Bringing together a novel (Disgrace, by Coetzee), Julius Malema&#8217;s so-called hate speeches and farm-dwellers eviction experiences in Kwazulu-Natal, the paper aims to analyse disputes on &#8220;existence ideals&#8221; that entail dogs as mediators in South Africa and beyond. Insults through animals challenge our understanding of persistent racism and offer an opportunity to an anthropological self-critic.

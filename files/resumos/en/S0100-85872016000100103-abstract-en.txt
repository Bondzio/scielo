Abstract The article analyzes the religious beliefs, experiences and practices of Buenos Aires slum´s inhabitants. We analyze data from a questionnaire applied in 2014 to a representative sample of the city´s slums. The article begins with a brief discussion on &#8220;popular religiosity&#8221;, in which the research project of this study is framed. Base on the tables from our aggregated data we address the variety of slum inhabitant´s beliefs; we then address their diversity of religious affiliations, and the diversity of their religious practices, devotions and rituals. We conclude summarizing our analysis by presenting profiles of believers from the precarious neighborhoods. The study shows that the population under study manifestations of faith are varied, and that they accompany their lives in different ways.

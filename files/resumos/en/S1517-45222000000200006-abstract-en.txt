The study of contractual forms and work organization reveals some consistency between the processes seen in the central countries and those which Latin American sociology has been dealing with for several decades. The Argentinean situation is, in this case, a focal point to that analysis, since the rise in precariousness and unemployment during the 90s tended to restructure a work market where the salaried condition, stable and protected, had been established since mid-century. The recent jurisprudence shows the impact of those trends over the symbolic forms of representing work in the legal arena, where the judges decisions intervened in the contractual and organizational boundaries of salaried work. That reflection on the several forms of labor insertion link subjects in a common field between sociology, law and economics. Thus, it is able to contribute to interdisciplinary exchange in social sciences. At the same time, the approach adopted allows the questioning of conceptual collaboration between several classical traditions within sociology and its potential contribution to the understanding of work structuring in contemporary societies.

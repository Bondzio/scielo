This article places decoloniality as a project that had a simultaneous beginning to the modern/colonial world-system. The latter had organized differences and inequalities among people based on the idea of race. The article highlights, as a distinctive feature of the decolonial project, the production of knowledge and narratives from geo-political and corporeal-political loci of enunciations. Among these loci of enunciation, we call attention to the knowledge produced from black perspectives, especially from the Americas and the Caribbean.

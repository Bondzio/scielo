The article presents the results of research, the objective of which was to investigate the attractiveness of a teaching career in Brazil from the viewpoint of students in the final year of secondary education, since it has been widely disclosed that there is a loss of interest in choosing teaching as a profession on the part of adolescents. The study was carried out in public and private schools in large or medium-size cities in different regions in Brazil. The data used for the analyses originated from two sources: a questionnaire and discussion groups. The results show that rejection of a teaching career is a recurrent theme among the young people involved in the research. The justifications of the students for the lack of attractiveness of the career are related to the absence of a personal identification with teaching, the social and financial conditions associated with exercising the profession, the students' own school experience and family influence.

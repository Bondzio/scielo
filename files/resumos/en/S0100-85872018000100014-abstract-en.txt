Abstract This piece analyzes the process of glocalisation of Brazilian Pentecostalism or charismatic Evangelicalism in the United Kingdom, based on interviews with Brazilian missionaries, and focusing on two related aspects of their experience that are in line with what William Connolly calls minority: a combined process of political and cultural assertiveness and subalternisation (postcolonial confinement), which provokes transformations in diasporic Pentecostal or charismatic identities. It is thus sought to provide an entry point for understanding the intricacies of the relationship between culture, faith, and power in contexts which, having been sources of missionary expansion of the Christian faith, increasingly become the targets of &#8220;reverse missions&#8221; from the South.

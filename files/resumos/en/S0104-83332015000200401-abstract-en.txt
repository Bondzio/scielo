AbstractAffects carry an intensity of social markers and subjectivity: lately, they have become highly profitable for industries that rely on the capitalization of bodily capacities. Based on ethnographic insight about Visibly Hot, a Brazilian retailer of sunglasses, the article focuses on the following questions: what are the instruments used by the enterprise that generate desire and aspirations that are being aimed at promoting their products and captivating their employees? Further, how do the proper employees participate and manipulate this process? On the one hand, the slogan "be different" promotes a multiplication of subjectivities, thus generating an advanced control of sexual and racial identities. On the other hand, the salesclerks develop their own affective techniques (identification with the brand, sexual stimulation) that once set in motion both enhance and trouble the channeled flow of sales.

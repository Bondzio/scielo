The study presented in this article has aimed to construct category parameters which could not only guide and ground initial or continuing teacher education, but also support the monitoring and assessment of the teaching action from a formative perspective. The support for this came from the contribution of experienced teachers working at various levels and areas, as well as coordinators and teacher educators. The guiding idea of the research was to conduct the proposed problematics from the reality of work in schools to construct references about the teaching action observed in its various aspects, in order to conceptualize the basic elements which distinguish it as qualified professional performance.

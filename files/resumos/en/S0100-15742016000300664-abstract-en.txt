Abstract This paper aims at elaborating a general mapping of the issue of the existing discursiveness about indiscipline in schools by analysing 35 articles published in Brazilian journals on the field of education between 1998 and 2015. For that end, two large analytical frames have been selected: the modes of apprehension of acts of indiscipline as shown by research carried out, as well as the proposals put forward by the researchers to tackle the problem. At the end of the text, some thought will be given pointing at the typical conflictuality of contemporary school practices as an observation post from where it is possible to catch the always uneven, unstable and, after all, indeterminate texture of the phatic relations among the protagonists.

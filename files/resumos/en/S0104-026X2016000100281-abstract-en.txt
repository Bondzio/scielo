Abstract: In this paper we intend to analyze the role played by Franco's dictatorship in Spain, chiefly by the national-Catholicism, in the transmission of a particular model of femininity which constituted a fundamental part of its policy of economic and social power, based on family, education and community. This analysis has been performed based on those readings, advices, speeches and reflections made by and for women, in order to provide tools for reflection on the ideological, cultural and mental survival of such model in the current Spanish society.

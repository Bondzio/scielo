The present article aims at measuring the final demand impact on the forest-based industry by using the 1998 State of Paraná social accounting matrix as the analysis tool. We also had to calculate the matrix multipliers. The increased effects of exogenous activity on the Wood/Furniture and Paper/Pulp activities brought a more intense demand shock to that sector. We noticed that the Wood and Furniture activity is mostly connected with the tertiary sector activities, while the Paper and Pulp activity is mostly connected with activities that need packing. Finally, we could identify the main impacts originated by an increased final demand in spite of the reduction in the number of Paraná Social Accounting Matrix economic activities.

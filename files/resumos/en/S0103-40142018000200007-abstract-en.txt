Abstract We examine the prospects and possibilities of the life that education can offer to today&#8217;s young people, who live in a fragmented world where disappointments and unrealized hopes can at any moment become the key issue of existence. The path toward their ethical and political reintegration involves the development of a critical awareness that may challenge the present and resist a future determined by alienation. Philosophy provides the means to confront societal and historical risks, preventing individuals from submerging in the existential, ethical and political decomposition that threatens us.

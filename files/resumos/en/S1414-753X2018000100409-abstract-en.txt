Abstract This article analyses the health impact of the installation of the Madeira Hydroelectric Complex to the population of Porto Velho county (Amazon, Brazil) between 2001 and 2010. The incidence of a selected list of diseases was evaluated with regard to changes that took place in the human and natural environment, compared to the phase prior to the installation of the hydroelectric power projects. An assessment of environmental responsiveness and the population&#8217;s vulnerability was carried out based on a matrix of socioeconomic, health, and environmental indicators. Malaria, Aids, leishmaniosis and dengue transmission were differentially affected by the implementation of the hydroelectric power plants in a context of limited government intervention in terms of sanitation and health care infrastructure, deforestation, different forms of land use and cover, in addition to migration processes within the area influenced by the hydroelectric power plants.

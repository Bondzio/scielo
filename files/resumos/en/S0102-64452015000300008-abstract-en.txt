Abstract The article presents the works of two artists involved with the connection between art and memory. Both come from Latin America: one from Brazil, Leila Danziger, the other from Argentina, Eugenia Bekeris. Both have developed particular and original poetics. Both have received the memory of Shoah, Holocaust, as a terrible heritage. In their work, we can see images and words coming together to create a powerful and at the same time delicate art of memory. With their works we are able to both, see from a closer spot the ruinous landscape of the 20th century, and rethink our own present from a more critical point of view.

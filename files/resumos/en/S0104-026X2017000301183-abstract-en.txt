Abstract: This article seeks to account for the socio-cultural processes involved in the characterization of bodies (understood as more than a mere biological result) from the analysis of the bills related to abortion in Argentina. Since the return of democracy in that country (1983) more than sixty projects were submitted by Congress which deal with various aspects concerning voluntary termination of pregnancy. Among those with parliamentary status, there are projects aimed at decriminalizing abortion until the 12/14 weeks of pregnancy, and others who only propose changes to existing legal abortions. Among many others, the legislative sphere is an area of production of meanings about subjectivities and bodies. Thus, we understand it as a field of domination and disputes for the imposition of roles and practices associated with sexuality that affect the exercise of reproductive and non-reproductive rights and, in this specific case, the bodily autonomy of women.

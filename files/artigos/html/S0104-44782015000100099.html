<p>This paper offers an analysis of the illiberal practices and discourse of the
                    Global War on Terror (GWoT) and demonstrates how the United States of America
                    used the liberal argument as a qualitative metric of its success and failure in
                    the GWoT. I argue that ‘the othering’ of Salafi Jihadists as well the full
                    military involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq were both philosophically rooted in
                    the liberal thinking of Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill, which have
                    traditionally guided US foreign policy. More significantly, these liberal
                    philosophies of history and international relations hold within them the seeds
                    of illiberalism by depicting non-liberal, undemocratic societies/organisations
                    as ‘barbaric’ – and as such prime candidates for intervention and regime change.
                    Predicated upon this logic, the discourse of the GWoT framed Al Qaeda as a key
                    existential threat to not only the United States but also the ‘civilised world’
                    in general and one which required a ‘liberal defensive war’ in response. It was
                    the successful securitisation of Al Qaeda that essentially enabled the United
                    States to adopt deeply illiberal policies to counter this so-called existential
                    threat by using any means at its disposal.</p>

<p>Este trabalho apresenta uma análise das práticas e discursos iliberais da Guerra
                    Global Contra o Terror (GWoT, na sigla em inglês) e demonstra como os Estados
                    Unidos da América usaram o argumento liberal como uma métrica qualitativa do seu
                    sucesso e fracasso na GWoT. Argumento que o “estranhamento do outro” (salafistas
                    jihadistas) – bem como o envolvimento militar no Afeganistão e Iraque foram
                    filosoficamente enraizadas no pensamento liberal de Immanuel Kant e John Stuart
                    Mill, que tradicionalmente têm guiado a política externa estadunidense. Mais
                    significativamente, essas filosofias liberais da história e das relações
                    internacionais têm dentro de si as sementes do iliberalismo ao descrever
                    sociedades/organizações não-liberais e antidemocráticas como “bárbaras” – e,
                    como tal, os principais candidatos para a intervenção e mudança de regime.
                    Predicado nessa lógica, o discurso da GWoT enquadrou a Al Qaeda como uma ameaça
                    existencial chave, não apenas para os Estados Unidos, mas também para o “mundo
                    civilizado” em geral, exigindo então uma “guerra defensiva liberal” em resposta.
                    Foi o sucesso da securitização da Al Qaeda que essencialmente permitiu aos
                    Estados Unidos adotarem políticas profundamente iliberais para combater esta
                    dita ameaça existencial utilizando-se de todos os meios à sua disposição</p>

<p>When George W. Bush addressed a joint session of Congress and the American nation in
                the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, perhaps no one could have predicted that
                the following decade would see the scale of intervention that followed in
                Afghanistan and Iraq, with concomitantly high levels of not only civilian deaths but
                also the unintended security fallouts that are more than evident in the Middle East
                today. More significantly, perhaps no one could have predicted the deeply illiberal
                policies and practices that would be adopted by the United States (US) in order to
                address the threat of Al Qaeda and its allies. These practices seen, amongst others,
                in cases such as the Abu Ghraib scandal, the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, the use of
                targeted assassinations and extraordinary renditions, not only bring into question
                the very essence of liberal values that the United States purports to uphold but
                also engender a deeper questioning of the relevance of liberalism in today’s
                world.</p>
<p>In this article, I undertake an analysis of the neoconservative discourse and
                practice of the Global War on Terror (GWoT) as evidenced through statements made by
                George W. Bush and other key members of his administration. This analysis
                demonstrates how the United States of America, under the Bush administrations, has
                used what is in essence a liberal argument as a qualitative metric of its success
                and failure in the GWoT. I argue that the foundation for ‘the othering’ of Salafi
                Jihadists as well as the identification of specific geographical locales for full
                military intervention (Afghanistan and Iraq) are both based in the liberal states’
                construction of an argument that depicts these societies/agents/organisations as
                undemocratic, barbaric, backward and illiberal – in other words, as prime candidates
                for armed intervention and regime change. Predicated upon this logic, the
                administrations of President George W. Bush, successfully framed Salafi-Jihadism as
                a key existential threat to not only the United States but also the ‘civilised’
                liberal world order. Having successfully securitised the Al Qaeda brand of
                Salafi-Jihadism, the United States under the Bush administrations then framed itself
                as the guardian and upholder of democratic values seeking to preserve a liberal way
                of life in the face of what was an unprecedented threat. However, somewhat
                paradoxically, this was achieved through the adoption of deeply illiberal practices
                that have encouraged some to question the very foundations of both the American
                nation and the liberal world order.</p>
<p>In this article I argue that these deeply illiberal practices and policies can trace
                their roots to a long-standing tradition of liberalism and more particularly to the
                thinking of philosophers like Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill. To this end, I
                first outline the basis tenets of liberalism and liberal internationalism as used in
                this paper before outlining how the seeds of illiberalism can be located in the
                historical writings of Kant and Mill<sup><a href="#fn03"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>. Having provided this context, I then identify how US
                foreign policy, at the very least from the 20<sup>th</sup> century onwards, has not
                only championed intervention for democracy promotion but also how it has framed such
                intervention as a key national security imperative. This background will serve to
                contextualise the GWoT and highlight how it does not necessarily represent a sharp
                break from the policies adopted by previous US administrations – although it does
                admittedly signify a shift from the more benign liberalism of the 1990s. Once this
                theoretical and historical foundation has been laid, I will proceed to illustrate
                how the United States under the Bush administration deliberately securitised Al
                Qaeda by framing 9/11 as an exceptional act and used it to justify the interventions
                in Afghanistan and Iraq. The deliberate construction of this discourse will be then
                be illustrated through a thematic analysis of key communications from the Bush
                administrations, most particularly the Presidential State of Union addresses and US
                National Security Strategies.</p>

<a name="idp3600160"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">II. Tracing the illiberal roots of Liberalism</p>
<p>The liberal euphoria that surfaced in the Western world in the early 1990s following
                the defeat of Soviet communist ideology has in recent times given way to exaggerated
                claims of a decline and defeat of the liberal international order in the early
                twentieth century. Much of this disillusionment can be credited to the recent global
                financial crisis, the rise of non-liberal powers and illiberal ideologies as well as
                the GWoT as it has unfolded since the horrific attacks of 11 September 2001. While
                the 9/11 attacks mobilised the United States into commencing a global fight against
                terrorism they also marked the adoption of deeply illiberal policies by a country
                that had been known for its long-standing liberal tradition. Over the past fourteen
                years these policies have not only engendered one of the most serious civil
                liberties crises within the United States but brought into question its commitment
                to the basic liberal values of individual rights at the international level as
                well.</p>
<p>Various scholars have suggested, either implicitly or explicitly, that the seeds of
                US illiberalism lie in its deep-rooted liberal tradition and that the
                neo-conservatives share more than a passing resemblance with so-called liberal
                    ‘purists’<sup><a href="#fn04"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> However, before I
                probe this link and given the ‘varieties of liberalism’ (<sup><a href="#B15">Doyle 1997</a></sup>), it is useful to begin by stating exactly
                what liberalism means in the context of this article. Liberalism refers to a
                political system or a set of political values based on the legal equality of
                citizens, political representativeness, individual freedom and <em>laissez
                    faire</em>. In essence, it is grounded in the belief that the promotion of
                freedom is inextricably linked to peace in that governments that respect individual
                liberty are more likely to exercise restraint and have peaceful intentions in their
                foreign policies (<em>idem</em>). Founded on this logic, liberal
                internationalism has created a structure of international cooperation based on
                shared norms which have come to include a respect for human rights,
                non-intervention, anti-imperialism, free markets, political and religious tolerance
                as well a toleration of differing ideas as to what constitutes a good life (<sup><a href="#B23">Grey 2004</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B54">Williams 2006</a></sup>). However, this definition belies the heavy-handed US
                response to the 9/11 attacks and its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Nonetheless,
                while this understanding of liberalism seemingly cannot explain the excesses that
                have characterised US foreign policy in the recent past, a closer look at Immanuel
                Kant’s ideas in his influential essay <em>Perpetual Peace</em> (1797)
                certainly sheds some light upon how deeply illiberal policies may be adopted by a
                liberal state.</p>
<p>Michael Desch argues that Kant’s ‘<em>Perpetual Peace</em>’ has exerted the
                greatest influence on U.S. foreign policy primarily through the theory of
                ‘democratic peace’ and it is in his work that the very roots of ‘liberalism’s
                illiberalism’ can be located (<sup><a href="#B10">Desch
                    2007</a></sup>)<sup><a href="#fn05"><sup>4</sup></a></sup>. Those who adhere
                to this argument predicate it on the logic that Kant’s thesis has provided the
                “philosophical rationale for efforts to promote peace through the spread of
                democracy under the auspices of international institutions such as Woodrow Wilson’s
                League of Nations” (<em>idem</em>, p. 12)<sup><a href="#fn06"><sup>5</sup></a></sup>. It is certainly true that over the past century or so,
                liberal internationalism has come to encompass both a Wilsonian-like belief in the
                liberal state’s moral duty to establish peace and liberty through the active spread
                of democracy as well as (in some circles) a belief that it is, in fact, in the
                liberal state’s strategic interest to do so. It has, therefore, been argued<sup><a href="#fn07"><sup>6</sup></a></sup> that liberal states have overcome
                their distaste for external armed interventions in pursuit of this moral duty and in
                doing so have extended liberal values to peoples and places where they did not
                previously exist.</p>
<p>The philosophical roots of this argument may be traced to Kant’s objective of
                establishing perpetual peace without the need for an overarching world government
                that was embodied in the first of his definitive articles, which states that:
                “nations should be republics and the constitution will be based on the civil rights
                of individuals within that state” (<sup><a href="#B54">Williams
                    2006</a></sup>, p. 25)<sup><a href="#fn08"><sup>7</sup></a></sup>. But for
                such a system to be effective it was imperative that all countries have the same
                republican domestic political order. Kant’s reasoning is grounded in the belief that
                political systems where individuals, who more often than not tend to be directly
                impacted by the cost of wars, also have a say in whether it is waged are less likely
                to engage in this harmful activity (<sup><a href="#B10">Desch
                    2007</a></sup>, p. 12). Hence, as Kant argues in the first definitive article,
                republics where citizens’ opinions are reflected tend to be less inclined to engage
                in wars (<sup><a href="#B14">Doyle 1996</a></sup>). In short, a perpetual
                peace can only be guaranteed only if all parties to it are liberal, ‘democratic’
                states because only then will there be conditions established to not only facilitate
                a cessation of all hostilities but “an <em>end</em> to all hostilities” and
                therefore the end “of all existing <em>reasons</em> for future war”(my
                emphasis) (<sup><a href="#B22">George 2000</a></sup>). Desch therefore
                points out that, unlike earlier social contract theorists like Thomas Hobbes and
                John Locke, Kant saw the state of nature as so treacherous that its dangers could
                only be mitigated by a radical transformation of <em>both</em> a country’s
                internal domestic order as well as the international system. But more crucially for
                the purpose of this thesis, Kant conferred republican states with the right to bring
                to an end to the international state of war through the use of force against other
                states in order to compel them to embrace republicanism. He thus explains how, “for
                the sake of its own security, each nation can and should demand that others nations
                enter into a contract resembling the civil one and guaranteeing the rights of each”
                    (<sup><a href="#B30">Kant 1983</a></sup>, p. 116). In other words, the
                pacific union of liberal states” (<sup><a href="#B10">Desch 2007</a></sup>,
                p. 13; <sup><a href="#B13">Doyle 1986</a></sup>, p. 1160)<sup><a href="#fn09"><sup>8</sup></a></sup>, which engenders a society of states where the
                civil constitution of every nation is republican and thus guarantees the rights of
                each nation in the international system. Thus, Kant, arguably the greatest of the
                liberal internationalist, makes a fairly water-tight case for the use of illiberal
                means including force, coercion and intervention to bring about change in the
                international system and in doing so marks a fundamental departure from classical
                international law with its unqualified commitment to state sovereignty<sup><a href="#fn10"><sup>9</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Desch goes on to clarify that while Kant’s advocacy of forcible conversion to
                republicanism seems to contradict his fifth preliminary article which categorically
                forbids intervention in the domestic politics of other countries this is, in fact,
                not the case. This is because for liberals, “state sovereignty ultimately derives
                from the rights of individuals in the state of nature. When individuals surrender
                their natural liberty to the commonwealth through the social contract, then it
                inheres in the state” (<sup><a href="#B10">Desch 2007</a></sup>, pp.
                13–14). While intervention in the domestic affairs of such a representative states
                violates the individual rights of its citizens, a state which is not representative
                does not enjoy the same rights of non-intervention<sup><a href="#fn11"><sup>10</sup></a></sup>. This is framed in Kant’s idea of the ‘unjust enemy’
                that he conceptualises in <em>Metaphysics of Morals</em> (1798), and which
                is defined as “one whose publicly expressed Will, either in word or deed, betrays a
                maxim which, if it were taken as a universal rule, would make a state of peace among
                the nations impossible, and would necessarily perpetuate the state of nature” (<sup><a href="#B27">Jahn 2005b</a></sup>, p. 14). An unjust enemy is one that
                refuses to adopt republicanism and in doing so threatens the pacific federation. In
                other words, non-republican states threaten the historical evolution towards the
                “end-state of a law ruled international society [and] as a consequence, not only the
                international community of states but each state is entitled to apply ‘all means’
                [...] against this dangerous opponent” (<sup><a href="#B43">Müller
                    2014</a></sup>, p. 479). This is how war remains a legitimate “instrument of
                statecraft in relation to authoritarian regimes” (<sup><a href="#B16">Dunne 2009</a></sup>, p. 108).</p>
<p>A final key point that needs be made is how Kant’s thesis allows a republican hegemon
                to <em>actively</em> promote the establishment of the republican league by
                inspiring other states to adopt a republican political order both domestically and
                in the international system (<sup><a href="#B14">Doyle 1996</a></sup>;
                    <sup><a href="#B10">Desch 2007</a></sup>). Kant, therefore, promotes
                the idea that a gradual expansion of the <em>foedus pacificum</em> is
                necessary for the establishment of perpetual peace. Proponents of the democratic
                peace have seen this Kantian logic as the philosophical justification for active
                democracy promotion in the international system. Beate Jahn argues that while the
                issue of consent is never really discussed by democratic peace theorists, it is a
                central concern for not only liberal thought in general but also the democratic
                peace thesis in particular. Given that liberal institutions derive their legitimacy
                from consent, presumably the absence of consent denies non-liberal states of this
                very legitimacy. Logically, Jahn argues, this implies that citizens of non-liberal
                states would consent to liberal institutions, and yet they do not. This is possibly
                the result of various external and internal barriers, that may range from “political
                repression, or non-liberal cultural traditions [...] [to] simply a lack of exposure
                to the benefits of liberal life” (<sup><a href="#B27">Jahn 2005b</a></sup>,
                p. 182). However, proponents of the democratic peace thesis, by founding themselves
                on logic of an expanding <em>foedus pacificum</em>, tend towards
                “interventionism irrespective of consent” (<em>ibidem</em>). In short,
                despite the presence of key tensions, by viewing the existence of non-liberal states
                as a threat to perpetual peace and the sustainable longevity of the pacific union,
                Kantian liberalism potentially provides the philosophical justification for the use
                of illiberal means of intervention, hegemony, coercive regime change and democracy
                promotion, thus illuminating the deeply illiberal roots of liberalism<sup><a href="#fn12"><sup>11</sup></a></sup>.</p>

<div class="section">
<a name="idp3664512"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">III. Mill and the Logic of the Barbarian Other</p>
<p>If Kantian liberalism provides the philosophical grounding for intervention then John
                Stuart Mill’s liberalism provides even further justification for spreading liberal
                values to ‘barbarian’ societies, which lack them in order to bolster the liberal
                project by expanding the pacific federation. Mill’s theory, in stark contrast to
                early liberal philosophers like Adam Smith, Edmund Burke and Jeremy Bentham, is in
                essence a defence of colonial imperialism and a ‘civilising despotism’ (<sup><a href="#B45">Pitts 2005</a></sup>). Jennifer Pitts calls this the
                “liberal turn to empire” and argues that it was “accompanied by the eclipse of
                nuanced and pluralist theories of progress as they gave way to more contemptuous
                notions of ‘backwardness’ and a cruder dichotomy between barbarity and civilisation”
                    (<em>idem</em>, pp. 2–3). Indeed it is in this dichotomy that J. S.
                Mill’s philosophy of history most closely resembles contemporary liberal thought and
                fully reconciles the colonial imperial project with what are the core tenants of
                contemporary liberalism – in what Beate Jahn calls a ‘perfect match’<sup><a href="#fn13"><sup>12</sup></a></sup>. Thus, Mill deploys the language of
                civilisation, savagery and barbarism to outline his view of the world and the stages
                in the development of history and to essentially justify imperialism and the
                colonial enterprise<sup><a href="#fn14"><sup>13</sup></a></sup>. From these
                stages of history, he identifies modern civilisation as the highest form and claims
                that it embodies what were (by this time) the familiar liberal characteristics of
                “commerce, manufacture, agriculture, cooperation, social intercourse, law, justice,
                the protection of both individuals and property and in ideal cases, the existence of
                a representative government” (<sup><a href="#B27">Jahn 2005b</a></sup>, p.
                    194)<sup><a href="#fn15"><sup>14</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Mill frames civilisation as the direct opposite of barbarism – indeed as Jahn so
                fittingly states, as the very “negation of barbarism” (<sup><a href="#B26">Jahn 2005a</a></sup>). Framed in this manner, barbarians are a
                threat, the proverbial ‘other’ and everything that modern civilisation is not:
                infantile, incapable of ‘self-government’ (<sup><a href="#B45">Pitts
                    2005</a></sup>, p. 5). violent and irrational. Mill’s thought therefore makes an
                inherent distinction between a culturally superior and a culturally inferior peoples
                    (<em>idem</em>, p. 605), on the basis of which he argues that one set of
                rules must exist for relations between civilised nations and an entirely other set
                for those between civilised and barbarian nations. “[N]one but civilised nations
                have ever been capable of forming an alliance (<sup><a href="#B39">Mill
                    1990</a></sup>, p. 49) because alliances require reciprocity, which barbarians are
                incapable of. As such, “they [<em>i.e.</em> barbarian nations] cannot be
                depended on for observing any rules” (<sup><a href="#B38">Mill
                    1984</a></sup>, p. 118). Mill therefore constructs the relationship between
                civilised nations as necessarily governed by laws of equality where aggressive wars
                and intervention is non-existent and unnecessary. However, these ideas of equality
                and relations based in liberal principles only applied amongst civilised
                    nations<sup><a href="#fn16"><sup>15</sup></a></sup>. In sharp contrast,
                relations between civilised nations and barbarian people are necessarily
                hierarchical.</p>
<p>For Mill progress is critical and his focus remains unrelentingly upon “man as a
                progressive being” (<sup><a href="#B40">Mill 2005</a></sup>, p. 14). His
                construction of different stages of history as a development from savagery to
                civilisation reflects both this philosophy and focus. However, Mill warns, progress
                from one stage to the next is by no means automatic. Indeed backward development and
                stagnation are real dangers and unfortunately “among the most melancholy facts in
                history” (<sup><a href="#B26">Jahn 2005a</a></sup>, p. 603). While on the
                one hand civilised nations face the dangers of backward development and stagnation
                on the other, savage and barbarian peoples lack the very faculties to develop and
                progress independently and without the influence of a foreign, ‘civilising’ force.
                As such, it becomes the responsibility of civilised peoples to compel the savage and
                barbarian nations to change and move towards progress. As this can only be achieved
                through force, despotism becomes the most appropriate form of rule for savages,
                barbarians and semi-barbarous peoples (<sup><a href="#B27">Jahn
                    2005b</a></sup>, p. 196). There are clear tones of what can only be categorised as
                condescending paternalism and ‘the white man’s burden’ in Mill’s liberal philosophy,
                which asserts that, “despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with
                barbarians, <em>provided the end be their improvement</em> [my emphasis],
                and the means justified by actually effecting that end” (<sup><a href="#B40">Mill 2005</a></sup>, p. 14). In short for Mill, “barbarians have no
                rights as a <em>nation,</em> except a right to such treatment as may, at the
                earliest possible period, fit them for becoming one” (Mill as quoted in <sup><a href="#B26">Jahn 2005a</a></sup>, p. 605).</p>
<p>Indeed, a close inspection of Mill’s philosophy of history and international affairs
                makes it clear that he is an advocate of what Pitts terms as “a despotic, but
                civilising, imperial rule” or a “progressive colonial despotism” (<sup><a href="#B45">Pitts 2005</a></sup>, p. 133, p. 136). Jahn outlines how Mill’s
                philosophy, which on the basis of establishing a clear moral and political hierarchy
                between civilised and barbarian peoples, essentially makes a case against extending
                the rights of sovereignty and non-intervention to barbarian nations, is clearly
                echoed in contemporary liberal thought and, more significantly for this paper, in
                the liberal rhetoric surrounding the GWoT as well. Firstly, Jahn argues,
                “non-liberal or ‘outlaw states’ are defined by their refusal of comply with
                international law” – in other words, their refusal to reciprocate based on which
                they can then be “denied the right to sovereignty and non-intervention”. Second, he
                argues that, “intervention is an appropriate means to speed up the development of
                ‘all peoples’, who will be ‘safer and more secure’ once the sources of ‘aggressive
                and dangerous behaviour’ are removed” (<sup><a href="#B27">Jahn
                    2005b</a></sup>, p. 197)<sup><a href="#fn17"><sup>16</sup></a></sup>. In
                short, Mill’s philosophy makes a fairly robust case for inequality and aggressive
                (if paternalistic and civilising) intervention in the affairs of those categorised
                as barbarian ‘others’ in order to further, what would in contemporary liberal
                thinking be categorised as, the democratic peace. Taken together, the impact and
                influence exerted by the philosophies and worldviews of Kant and Mill upon US
                politicians, domestic and foreign policy should not be underestimated<sup><a href="#fn18"><sup>17</sup></a></sup>.</p>

                Necessity</p>
<p>Having traced some of the historical philosophical influences on contemporary US
                foreign policy, I now turn to understanding the place of the GWoT in the broader
                trajectory of American behaviour in the international system. Here it is clear that
                the United States has been preoccupied with establishing international peace and
                stability through the promotion of liberal democracy, through the use military force
                if necessary, at least since the twentieth century<sup><a href="#fn19"><sup>18</sup></a></sup>. There is little doubt that US foreign policy has been
                shaped by its belief in the significance of not only adhering to liberal democratic
                values but also a perceived obligation to spreading these values and norms
                internationally. Tony Smith states that, “the most consistent tradition in American
                foreign policy has been the belief that the nation’s security is best protected by
                the expansion of democracy worldwide” (<sup><a href="#B49">Smith
                    1993</a></sup>, p. 9). Jonathan Monten in turn argues that the “concept of the
                United States as agent of historical transformation and liberal change in the
                international system informs almost the entire history of US foreign policy and
                democracy promotion is not just another foreign policy instrument or idealist
                diversion; it is central to US political identity and sense of national purpose”
                    (<sup><a href="#B42">Monten 2005</a></sup>, p. 113). In this regard,
                the GWoT may be viewed as but an extension of what in essence has been a historical
                US practice of democratisation conducted to ensure both its national security and
                perceived survival in what is a hierarchical and dangerous international system<sup><a href="#fn20"><sup>19</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>There were various efforts in the 20<sup>th</sup> century to spread the values of
                liberalism by exporting democracy to countries that had hitherto been ruled by
                dictators and authoritarian regimes. A large number of these efforts were promoted
                by the United States and backed by the use of U.S. military force (<sup><a href="#B33">Kurth 2005</a></sup>, p. 306). In fact, the 20<sup>th</sup> century
                began with the United States engaging in three separate military interventions aimed
                at bringing democracy to the former Spanish colonies of the Philippines, Cuba and
                Puerto Rico (<sup><a href="#B32">Kurth 2004</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B33">2005</a></sup>). More significantly, not all of these interventions
                were conducted without sustaining significant losses. For instance, the U.S.
                military intervention in the Philippines from 1899–1902, with its bloody repression
                of the local insurgency, not only resulted in the loss of around four thousand U.S.
                soldiers but also resulted in the deaths of 16,000 Filipino guerrillas and as many
                as 200,000 civilians (<sup><a href="#B33">Kurth 2005</a></sup>, p.
                    306)<sup><a href="#fn21"><sup>20</sup></a></sup>. This paternalistic
                trend of democracy promotion was further strengthened by President Woodrow Wilson
                who first sent the U.S. Marines into several Latin American countries in order to
                “teach the Latin Americans to elect good men,” and then sent in U.S. troops into
                Europe stating that the United States was going to “make the world safe for
                democracy” (<sup><a href="#B33">Kurth 2005</a></sup>, p. 306). Indeed, as
                Wilson stressed, “America would spend her blood and her might for the principles
                that gave her birth and happiness” (Woodrow Wilson as quoted in <sup><a href="#B64">Kaplan 2003</a></sup>, p. 22). James Kurth identifies four theatres
                where the United States has used military conquest and occupation to bring about
                political democratization. <blockquote>
<p>“(1) the Caribbean basin and Central America from the 1900s–1930s (Cuba, the
                        Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Nicaragua) and again from the 1960s–1990s
                        (the Dominican Republic and Haiti again and also Grenada and Panama); (2)
                        Central Europe from the 1940s–1950s (West Germany, Austria, and Italy); (3)
                        Northeast Asia from the 1940s–1950s (Japan and South Korea); and (4)
                        Southeast Asia from the 1960s–1970s (particularly South Vietnam). Together,
                        these add up to more than a dozen cases in which the United States has used
                        military occupation to bring about political democratization. They provide
                        useful precedents and lessons for the [...] efforts in Iraq”</p>
<p>(<em>idem</em>, pp. 306–307).</p>
</blockquote></p>
<p>In other words, the use of military force by the United States for the cause of
                democracy promotion is not a new phenomenon and, at least empirically, one can argue
                that it has been a benchmark of American foreign policy in the 20<sup>th</sup>
                century. It is however worth noting that that the United States has had distinctly
                different approaches to fostering democracy in Europe <em>vs.</em> the
                Western Hemisphere, perhaps best illustrated by US policy under President Woodrow
                Wilson. For most people, it is Wilson’s European policy that was enacted “mainly
                through international agreements and organisations” (<sup><a href="#B49">Smith 1993</a></sup>, p. 62) that represents what has come to be known as
                ‘Wilsonianism’. However, this perspective seems to forget the hard, militaristic,
                unilateral stance that the US chose to adopt in its dealings with Latin America in
                their efforts to teach them to ‘elect good men’ (<sup><a href="#B10">Desch 2007</a></sup>, p. 19). Wilson’s belief in America’s role in spreading
                liberal values and norms is evident when he declared in 1912, “I believe that God
                has planted in us visions of liberty [...] that we are chosen and prominently chosen
                to show the way to the nations of the world how they shall walk in the path of
                liberty” (<sup><a href="#B54">Williams 2006</a></sup>, p. 3). This stance
                is a clear illustration of how the Kantian notion of the democracy promotion and the
                Millean notion of the ‘barbarian nation’ and a ‘hierarchical’ international system
                have translated into the practices of US foreign policy.</p>
<p>At the same time, as mentioned above this was by no means a temporary or passing
                phase of US foreign policy. Instead, the “legacy of Wilson the democratic crusader
                was passed down from generation to generation – from Harry Truman, who argued that
                ‘totalitarian regimes undermine the foundations of international peace and hence the
                security of the United States’, to John. F. Kennedy – before being put to rest [I
                would argue with the benefit of hindsight, temporarily] in the jungles of Vietnam”
                    (<sup><a href="#B64">Kaplan 2003</a></sup>, p. 22). By the end of the
                Cold War, US armed interventions had evolved quite significantly, at least in
                material terms. By this period, the use of force could be relatively controlled
                thanks to the advent of precision technologies (<sup><a href="#B20">Freedman 2006b</a></sup>). Freedman argues that the direct result of this
                technological evolution was that there were fewer Western and civilian casualties
                than before. Even so, an inherent tension within liberal thinking remained as an
                instinctive distaste for the use of military force on part of non-interventionist
                liberals clashed with the interventionists’ crusader-like tendency to actively
                champion the cause of justice and protect the oppressed internationally through a
                vigorous promotion and promulgation of liberal norms and values (more on this
                below). Freedman makes a case that to some extent this tension appeared manageable
                in the armed interventions of the 1990s, which were undertaken to “protect the weak,
                shelter the poor and feed the hungry” (<sup><a href="#B19">Freedman
                    2006a</a></sup>, p. 51). He argues rather eloquently, that these interventions of
                the 1990s had less to do with Western interests than with Western sensibilities in
                the face of tremendous violence and human suffering. Although they tended to be
                conducted in the most part, rather reluctantly and somewhat tentatively and they
                produced somewhat mixed results - in humanitarian terms they most certainly made a
                difference. However, the key difficulty lay in creating stable political conditions
                in the wake of armed intervention that would allow Western forces to withdraw. In
                this, armed intervention proved to be a way of “thwarting a slide into hell but not
                too suited to grasping heaven” (<em>idem</em>, pp. 51–52).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, irrespective of the consequences of intervention, what is worth noting
                is that, as Freedman argues, these interventions were largely ‘wars of choice’,
                    <em>i.e.</em> they were altruistic rather than necessary for the
                interveners. I would argue that the same case might be made for the interventions in
                Latin America and to some extent also in Vietnam. In this sense, these interventions
                were ‘offensive liberal wars’, because they sought to aggressively extend liberal
                values and freedoms “to places where they were [...] absent, or at least in short
                supply” (<em>ibidem</em>). Philosophically grounded in the Kantian logic of
                an ever-extending pacific federation these were wars that were fought to ensure
                national security, and eventually a state of ‘perpetual peace’. It is significant
                that these wars tended to be waged when resources were available and tapered off
                when resources became scarce – clear reflections of how these were an exercise in
                ‘choice’ (<em>idem</em>, p. 63). Furthermore, these were wars fought for
                justice with little, if any, regard for context (<em>idem</em>, p. 65), very
                much in line with Mill’s philosophy of protecting and accelerating the development
                of ‘all peoples” through civilising, albeit aggressive and imperialistic,
                intervention (<sup><a href="#B27">Jahn 2005b</a></sup>, p. 197).</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, Freedman categorises the wars fought in Afghanistan and Iraq under
                the rubric of the ‘Global War on Terror’ as ‘defensive liberal wars’,
                    <em>i.e.</em> wars of necessity, fought to ensure survival, to defend
                and preserve the Western way of life. He argues that “because [these interventions]
                were strategically defensive, they took on the character of wars of necessity, [...]
                [where] no semblance of defeat could be tolerated. This meant that not only were the
                methods offensive, in that the war was taken into enemy territory; they were also
                less restrained than the interventions of the 1990s. In both cases the objectives
                also took on a more offensive aspect, as they came to involve an attempt to bring
                the Western way of life to brutalised countries” (<sup><a href="#B19">Freedman 2006a</a></sup>, p. 52). One can argue that even these ‘offensive wars’
                to some degree echoed the Wilsonian logic by seeking not only to guarantee national
                security by making ‘the world safe for democracy’ but also attempting to ‘teach the
                Afghans and Iraqis to elect good men’. Thus, not only was exporting liberty to the
                oppressed of Afghanistan and Iraq presented as a “great moral cause” it was framed
                as merely the beginning of a campaign that (much in same vein as Woodrow Wilson)
                aimed to “bring the hope of democracy [...] to every corner of the world” (George W.
                Bush as quoted in <sup><a href="#B64">Kaplan 2003</a></sup>, p. 21). What
                was different here however was that this was now an imperative, framed as essential
                for the survival of the nation. As such, while these wars of necessity had to be
                fought irrespective of resources and were criticised by opponents for the
                “simplistic presentation and the exaggerated role claimed for armed forces in their
                prosecution” (<sup><a href="#B19">Freedman 2006a</a></sup>, p. 52), they
                were by no means bereft of America’s traditional liberal aspirations. Thus, US armed
                ‘interventions’ post- 9/11 in Afghanistan and Iraq, marked a key shift in the
                policies of a liberal state that had for much of its history only undertaken
                offensive liberal wars of choice. The United States, in launching the GWoT, was
                ostensibly defending its right to survival against illiberal regimes and ideologies
                that challenged its political, social and economic principles. Somewhat
                paradoxically then, as per Freedman’s argument, defensive liberal wars not only
                needed to focus on context, they also tended to be more aggressive/offensive in
                their means and aims as the stakes were higher<sup><a href="#fn22"><sup>21</sup></a></sup>. As Desch argues then, what makes the GWoT so
                dangerous and impels the United States towards the use of illiberal tactics is not
                so much the physical threat that transnational terrorism or Al Qaeda pose to the
                homeland, but rather the existential threat they pose to the American way of life.
                However, were it not for the deeply rooted liberal tradition within in the United
                States it would, in all likelihood, “view the threat from global terrorism in a less
                alarmist light (more akin to a chronic crime problem than to World War IV) and would
                adopt more restrained policies in response (<em>i.e.</em> containment rather
                than global transformation)” (<sup><a href="#B10">Desch 2007</a></sup>, p.
                8).</p>

<a name="idp3759120"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">V. Interventionist liberals and interventionist neoconservatives: old
                bedfellows</p>
<p>Andrew Williams argues that, “what distinguishes liberal states from their illiberal
                counterparts is that they [<em>i.e.</em> liberal states] believe quite
                sincerely in the creation of a better world and that they are exemplars of what the
                world should look like” (<sup><a href="#B54">Williams 2006</a></sup>, p.
                5). There are some differences however regarding how this vision of creating a
                better world should be translated into practice, perhaps best encapsulated in
                Jonathan Monten’s broad categorisation of exemplarism and vindicationism. Monten
                argues that the exemplarism tradition of US liberalism believes that democracy and
                liberal values can be spread by example while the tradition of vindicationism
                believes that a more activist foreign policy is necessary to accomplish this (<sup><a href="#B42">Monten 2005</a></sup>)<sup><a href="#fn23"><sup>22</sup></a></sup>. Put another way, Monten essentially categorises the
                US liberal tradition as leaning either towards military interventionism or
                non-interventionism. He also rightly asserts that while both these approaches have
                coexisted in American political history, there have certainly been times when one
                has been more prevalent than the other (<sup><a href="#B45">Pitts
                    2005</a></sup>, p. 114). Based on such a categorisation, there seems to be more
                than just a passing resemblance between the neo-conservatives and the Wilsonian (or
                interventionist) liberals as regards their beliefs about intervention and
                democratisation. This is a good basis to comprehend not only the somewhat startling
                similarity between George W. Bush and Woodrow Wilson but also the deeply illiberal
                policies adopted by both during their respective presidencies.</p>
<p>Many scholars have remarked upon this similarity between George W. Bush and the
                neoconservatives and the liberal traditions of the United States as exemplified by
                Wilsonianism. Lawrence Kaplan wrote in 2003 that, “Bush is becoming the most
                Wilsonian president since Wilson himself” and “the influence of Wilsonian ideals may
                be gleaned in everything from the administration’s plans to use Iraq as a pivot for
                democratising the Arab world to its broader strategy of transforming rather than
                coexisting with totalitarian regimes” (<sup><a href="#B64">Kaplan
                    2003</a></sup>, p. 21). Indeed, many of the views that are associated with the
                neoconservatives today echo those of Woodrow Wilson who believed that American power
                could and should be used to promote justice and democracy internationally and that
                by reshaping the world, America would secure its political and security
                interests.</p>
<p>Proponents of this view also argue that a key requirement of a Wilsonian foreign
                policy is not only the desire to reshape the world and mould events, but also a
                conviction that the United States possesses the power and ability to do so – which
                also explains why this “Wilsonian impulse has ebbed and flowed” in American politics
                and possibly also why it remerged with the neoconservatives (<sup><a href="#B51">Steel 2003</a></sup>, p. 21). But this ideological continuity is
                perhaps not surprising given that the origins of neo-conservatism in the United
                States are liberal, lying as they do in the response by a group of Cold War liberal
                democrats and democratic socialists who, in the 1970s, opposed the utopianism of
                antipoverty programmes and affirmative action domestically and the policy of détente
                with the Soviet Union abroad. Instead these neoconservatives, as they came to be
                known, argued for a foreign policy that not only could curb the spread of communism
                but also actively promote democracy in the international system as a mechanism to
                secure United States’ economic and strategic security. However, it is imperative to
                note that while it may have had reactionary liberal roots and despite some obvious
                similarities with Wilsonianism, over time American neo-conservatism has come to
                “embody a distinctive and somewhat coherent set of causal and normative beliefs
                organised around the assertion of US military strength, resolve and political
                values” (<sup><a href="#B42">Monten 2005</a></sup>, pp. 142–143)<sup><a href="#fn24"><sup>23</sup></a></sup>. In this regard, and thanks to the
                unapologetic desire to channel US power to affect democratic change in the
                international system, neo-conservatism can be firmly situated within the long
                liberal tradition of ‘vindicationism’<sup><a href="#fn25"><sup>24</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Where the neoconservatives differ from traditional liberal interventionists is in
                their emphasis on the centrality of US military power as the primary instrument to
                engender liberal change and generate a ‘new world order’ – and this became amply
                clear over the course of the GWoT<sup><a href="#fn26"><sup>25</sup></a></sup>. It is because of this that Ronald Steel argues that, <blockquote>
<p>“Liberals and neoconservatives may both be correct in considering themselves
                        to be Wilsonians. In truth, they are more alike than they admit in their
                        ideological ambitions and their moral justifications [...] In practice the
                        difference between interventionist liberals and interventionist
                        neoconservatives is more a matter of degree than of principle. It rests on
                        how much exercise of military power the liberals will rationalise and how
                        much deference to liberal clichés the neoconservatives will tolerate”</p>
<p>(<sup><a href="#B51">Steel 2003</a></sup>, p. 20)<sup><a href="#fn27"><sup>26</sup></a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote></p>
<p>At the same time, the transformative impulse for neo-conservatism also relies upon a
                sincere belief in US capabilities to affect liberal change abroad, which is in turn
                based upon an urgent acknowledgement of both its remarkable post-Cold War military
                primacy as well as its unrivalled position of power in the unipolar international
                system. Strategically then, the GWoT must also be understood as an attempt by
                neoconservatives to use America’s position as the world’s sole superpower to secure
                an unmatched position of advantage in the international system. In other words, the
                GWoT represents a culmination of the historical neoconservative call for using force
                to check the emergence of potential challengers to US predominance. It is worth
                noting that in the post-Cold War period, the neoconservatives viewed traditional
                balance of power strategies as both unnecessary and unsuitable for what they argued
                were radically different circumstances. It was widely acknowledged, and not solely
                by the neoconservatives, that ongoing system-level changes meant that the United
                States could not expect to remain the sole superpower in the world forever. This was
                then America’s “unipolar moment”<sup><a href="#fn28"><sup>27</sup></a></sup>
                and the neoconservatives (as well as various other US administrations, including
                those of George W.H. Bush and Bill Clinton) argued that it was imperative that the
                United States take advantage of its position to both preserve and extend its
                hegemony in the international system. The resulting realignment in US foreign
                policy, most ostensibly reflected in America’s gradual but steady shift away from
                multilateralism back towards a more unilateralist tendency, came to be both
                enthusiastically embraced and fully operationalised by the neoconservatives in
                George W. Bush’s administration<sup><a href="#fn29"><sup>28</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>The (re)emergence of an aggressive interventionist policy post-9/11 with the GWoT,
                can also be understood by viewing the historical evolution of American self-identity
                through the lens of ‘exceptionalism’, or the perception that the Unites States
                differs “qualitatively from other developed nations, because of its unique origins,
                national credo, historical evolution and distinctive political and religious
                institutions” (Harold Hongju Koh as quoted in <sup><a href="#B42">Monten
                    2005</a></sup>, p. 119). In foreign policy terms, exceptionalism translates into a
                belief that “liberal values transfer readily to foreign affairs” and thus bolsters
                the US tendency to attempt to both ‘remake’ international society and (re)assert its
                right to be different by taking “individual action against threats” (<sup><a href="#B05">Buzan 2004a</a></sup>). Hassner argues that, “exceptionalism
                carries with it a tendency to consider that the United States is empowered, because
                of the purity of its intentions and the excellence of its regime, to judge between
                good and evil, to award others good or bad points, to punish the wicked and
                troublemakers, not to recognize any superior legal authority above that which comes
                from the American people themselves, and to consider any external inclination to
                cast doubt on American intentions or to apply to it the criteria that it applies to
                others as an insult” (<sup><a href="#B06">Buzan 2004b</a></sup>, p. 155).
                Thus, inherent in exceptionalism is not only a clear notion of what it means to be
                American but also the rights, responsibilities and threats that come with being the
                United States. The fact that, threats are framed as exceptional is crucial to
                understanding how the rhetoric of the GWoT not only constructed 9/11 as exceptional
                but also how this notion of exceptionalism, itself rooted in a very particular
                vision of the United States’ mission abroad, enabled a successful securitisation of
                Al Qaeda and transnational terrorism by the neoconservatives.</p>
<p>As stated above, the discourse of the GWoT underscored the exceptional nature of the
                USA and, in doing so, provides us with critical insights into the United States’
                particular understanding of its role, position and privileges in the post-9/11,
                unipolar world. First, the discourse of the GWoT framed 9/11 as an exceptional act
                and a national tragedy. America was attacked <em>because</em> it was
                America, because it was “the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the
                world” (<sup><a href="#B55">Bush 2001a</a></sup>). In constructing 9/11 as
                an exceptional act of violence this discourse (re)established that, as the sole
                superpower, the United States not only enjoyed the advantage of exceptional powers
                and privileges in the international system but also attracted exceptional threats.
                As the focus of both “myriad resentments and the bearer of great responsibilities”
                    (<sup><a href="#B08">Derian 2002</a></sup>, p. 103) it was obliged to
                secure itself, not only because it had to but also because it could<sup><a href="#fn30"><sup>29</sup></a></sup>. Of course, as stated previously, the United
                States’ perceptions of threat and insecurity were essentially rooted in not only the
                structural pressures generated by the post-Cold War unipolar system (<sup><a href="#B05">Buzan 2004a</a></sup>) but also bolstered by a long foreign policy
                tradition which believed that US national security was best protected by the
                expansion of democracy. More crucially, the promotion of democracy and liberal
                change in the international system, as explained above, has been a central component
                of American political identity. Thus when these factors combined, they not only
                elevated America’s perceptions of the threats it was exposed to but also
                complemented elements of its exceptionalism. Thus, America’s propensity towards
                hypersecuritisation <em>i.e.</em>, its “tendency to both exaggerate threats
                and resort to excessive countermeasures” (<em>idem</em>, p. 18) already
                underway due to conditions of unipolarity, was further intensified by the attacks of
                9/11. To underscore once more, this hypersecuritisation was rooted very particularly
                in a liberal view of the world – <em>i.e.</em> in the notion that Al Qaeda
                represented an existential threat to key liberal values and freedoms in the
                international system. As a result, not only did this vision predispose the United
                States towards adopting an aggressive, unilateralist response to 9/11, but the
                universalist element of American exceptionalism also meant that it “could justify
                the pursuit of its own national security not just on the basis of preserving a
                distinctive nation [...] but also on the basis of protecting the future wellbeing
                and rights of all of humankind” (<em>idem</em>, p. 18). As Steel so
                eloquently puts it, “in seeking virtuous ends, they [<em>i.e.</em> the
                United States] embrace[ed] questionable means”. (<sup><a href="#B51">Steel 2003</a></sup>, p. 21). In short, the interplay between unipolarity and
                universalist aspects of American exceptionalism enabled the United States to both
                claim special rights and privileges in pursuit of its national security (<sup><a href="#B05">Buzan 2004a</a></sup>, pp. 18–20) and special (albeit
                illiberal) means to achieve the same. Thus, in constructing 9/11 as exceptional the
                Bush administration not only underscored the unique and privileged status of the US
                but also justified illiberal policy under the GWoT as the legitimate and necessary
                response of an exceptional nation-state.</p>

<a name="idp3815952"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">VI. The themes of the neoconservative GWoT discourse - in defence of liberal
                values and freedoms:</p>
<p>The securitisation of a Western way of life as exemplified by its liberal values and
                freedoms is clearly operationalised in the speeches and communications that emerge
                from the Bush administration from 2001–2008, in which Al Qaeda’s brand of
                international terrorism is progressively and successfully framed as an existential
                threat. Indeed, even a brief purview of the communications that emerged during this
                period reveal that the Bush administration’s foreign and security policies were
                essentially rooted in liberal concerns and principles. Bush’s 2004 State of the
                Union address asserted that the aim of the United States was “a democratic peace”.
                Similarly, the 2002 National Security Strategy “was framed by the desire to protect
                and extend liberty – even including the enigmatic goal of achieving a ‘balance of
                power that favours freedom’”<sup><a href="#fn31"><sup>30</sup></a></sup>. In
                examining the communications produced during the Bush administrations, especially
                his annual State of the Union addresses, the philosophical and political influences
                of Kant, Mill as well as Wilson are amply evident. Moreover, it is also clear how
                this discourse deliberately a) framed Al Qaeda as an existential threat to liberal
                values and freedoms and as such the Western way of life, and b) positioned the
                United States as a defender of these values in the international system. Certain key
                themes emerge in the securitisation rhetoric and can be located in almost all the
                documents studied. Upon closer examination these themes clearly constitute a
                step-by-step construction of a case for waging a defensive liberal war, that
                encompassed not only preventive military action and intervention but also had at its
                core the clear aim of democratising what were seen as backward and barbaric and
                societies, for the sake of US national security. In other words, what we see is in
                these communications is the systematic construction of the case, couched in Kantian,
                Millean and Wilsonian language, for armed intervention in first Afghanistan and then
                Iraq.</p>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp3821280"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">VI.1. Theme I: The presence of imminent danger from illiberal regimes and
                    ideologies</p>
<p>The regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq as well as both their and Al Qaeda’s
                    ideologies are represented in these communications as the very anti-thesis of
                    civilisation and the civilised. They are commonly described, either directly or
                    indirectly, using very Millean language and concepts such as ‘barbaric’, ‘evil’,
                    ‘brutal’ and ‘irrational’ and more significantly, as inherently violent. As Bush
                    states in his 2002 State of the Union address: “We have seen the depth of our
                    enemies’ <em>hatred in videos where they laugh about the loss of innocent
                        life</em> [my emphasis]. And the depth of their hatred is equalled by
                    the <em>madness of the destruction they design</em> [my emphasis]”
                        (<sup><a href="#B57">Bush 2002</a></sup>). At the same time, the
                    idea that traditional mechanisms of engagement are useless against this new,
                    innovative and frighteningly irrational and destructive enemy is also clear in
                    this discourse. For instance, the Bush administration’s 2002 National Security
                    Strategy states how “traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a
                    terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of
                    innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most
                    potent protection is statelessness” (<sup><a href="#B67">United
                        States 2002</a></sup>). Vice President Dick Cheney echoed these words when he
                    asserted that a group like Al Qaeda “cannot be held back by deterrence, nor
                    reasoned with through diplomacy” (<sup><a href="#B63">Cheney
                        2002</a></sup>). In other words, countries and groups identified as enemies in
                    the GWoT are framed by the discourse, as peoples with whom alliance or
                    negotiation is impossible because, as Mill argues, alliances require reciprocity
                    that barbarians, given that they cannot be relied on to observe rules, are
                    incapable of. Indeed, Bush underscored this blatant flaunting of established
                    norms and rules when he reminded us how Al Qaeda had, in targeting the civilian
                    population of the United States, directly violated “one of the principle norms
                    of the law of warfare” (<sup><a href="#B67">United States
                        2002</a></sup>). Al Qaeda, its allies and the nations that support them are
                    thus framed as ‘unjust enemies’ in this discourse and this is underscored by
                    constant references to their deliberate targeting and brutalisation of both
                    their own people as well as international civilian populations (more on this
                    below).</p>
<p>These groups and nations are also represented as posing a direct threat to US
                    national security given that they are engaged in plotting the destruction and
                    downfall of the ‘West’ in general, and of the United States, in particular.
                    Hence Bush argues, “We have found diagrams of American nuclear power plants and
                    public water facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons,
                    surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in
                    America and throughout the world” (<em>idem</em>). The shadowy nature of
                    transnational groups makes them all the more threatening because it challenges
                    the United States’ traditional military capabilities and undeniable
                    technological superiority. President Bush underscores this evolving and acute
                    threat to national security when he asserts how “enemies in the past needed
                    great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy
                    networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for
                    less than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to
                    penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against
                    us” (<em>idem</em>).</p>
<p>Some key words used in this discourse include repeated references to ‘evil’
                    -indeed one could argue that this word is almost overused in communications from
                    this period. Several variations of ‘kill’ and ‘murder’ are also common. Dangers,
                    chaos and wars are constantly referred to and then given concrete form through
                    references to terrorists and terrorism, 9/11, Chemical, Biological, Radiological
                    and Nuclear Weapons (CBRNs) and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs). These themes
                    can be found repeatedly in statements, for example Bush’s 2006 State of the
                    Union address: <blockquote>
<p>“Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder, and all of us
                            must take their declared intentions seriously. They seek to impose a
                            heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East and
                            arm themselves with weapons of mass murder. Their aim is to seize power
                            in Iraq and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and
                            the world. Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the
                            terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear. When they murder children at
                            a school in Beslan or blow up commuters in London or behead a bound
                            captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing
                            the violent to inherit the Earth. But they have miscalculated: We love
                            our freedom, and we will fight to keep it”</p>
<p>(<sup><a href="#B62">Bush
                        2006</a></sup>).</p>
</blockquote></p>
<p>Closely tied into this depiction of the terrorist ‘others’ is the logic that the
                    dangerous and illiberal regimes and ideologies associated with them must be
                    dismantled/disarmed in order to prevent them from attacking and destroying the
                    Western way of life. Thus, a clear association is made between the non-state
                    attackers of 9/11 with what is, in essence, a state-based preventive response.
                    Furthermore, repeated references are made to states that either collude with
                    radical Islamists by proving safe havens, financial and military support or turn
                    a blind eye to these radical groups while simultaneously representing a threat
                    in their own right to the safety and wellbeing of the United States and its
                    citizens. The discourse also references the Kantian idea that these are
                    repressive, non-representative states, essentially controlled by regimes that
                    violate citizen rights and reject the basic principles of democracy. As such
                    these states are framed as a threat to the ‘pacific federation’ and so it
                    becomes the United States’ responsibility to neutralise the threat and preserve
                    liberal values in the international system. What is key to note here is the
                    coalescing of multiple different threats into one large threat, which the United
                    States ignores at its own peril. The message is clear: the United States must
                    not shirk its liberal responsibilities but instead, once again, fight for the
                    freedoms, values and way of life of <em>all</em> civilised peoples. In
                    short, it <em>must</em> take military action to secure not only national
                    and international security but also human security. <blockquote>
<p>“Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger
                            facing America and the world, is outlaw regimes that seek and possess
                            nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. These regimes could use such
                            weapons for blackmail, terror, and mass murder. They could also give or
                            sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who would use them without the
                            least hesitation. This threat is new. America’s duty is familiar.
                            Throughout the 20th century, small groups of men seized control of great
                            nations, built armies and arsenals, and set out to dominate the weak and
                            intimidate the world. In each case, their ambitions of cruelty and
                            murder had no limit. In each case, the ambitions of Hitlerism,
                            militarism, and communism were defeated by the will of free peoples, by
                            the strength of great alliances, and by the might of the United States
                            of America”</p>

<a name="idp3846576"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">VI.2. Theme II: U.S. responsibility to protect its citizens and its way of
                    life</p>
<p>A second theme that emerges is the United States’ responsibility towards its own
                    citizens and way of life. The idea projected here is that of establishing a
                    system of security that cannot be breached. This not only references the
                    American aim of strengthening internal security but also protecting the homeland
                    by ‘taking the war to the enemy’ so that the ‘enemy does not come to our
                    shores’. This is very much in line with Freedman’s logic of the necessary,
                    defensive war that adopts offensive means and takes the fight to the enemy. More
                    significantly, once again it is about highlighting the particularly
                    responsibility of the US hegemon to secure national security, not by retreating
                    within its own borders but by looking outward and guaranteeing its foreign
                    policy interests in the international system. <blockquote>
<p>“In a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our
                            commitments and retreating within our borders. If we were to leave these
                            vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. They would
                            simply move the battlefield to our own shores. There is no peace in
                            retreat, and there is no honor in retreat. By allowing radical Islam to
                            work its will, by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself, we
                            would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals or even
                            in our own courage. But our enemies and our friends can be certain: The
                            United States will not retreat from the world, and we will never
                            surrender to evil”</p>
<p>(<sup><a href="#B62">Bush
                        2006</a></sup>).</p>
</blockquote></p>
<p>The neoconservative assumption that becomes evident in this discourse is that in
                    the process of protecting its own citizens and acting in its own interests the
                    United States also serves the interests of the international system. For
                    instance, according to Condoleezza Rice, “America’s pursuit of the national
                    interest will create conditions that promote freedom, markets, and peace. Its
                    pursuit of national interests after World War II led to a more prosperous and
                    democratic world. This can happen again” (<sup><a href="#B47">Rice
                        2000</a></sup>). In other words, not only is the US pursuit of its national
                    interests legitimate, it is also virtuous (<sup><a href="#B42">Monten 2005</a></sup>, p. 148). This connection between national and
                    international security as well as the link between security and liberal values
                    is repeatedly emphasised. For instance, Bush stated, “I believe we have a
                    responsibility to promote freedom that is as solemn as the responsibility is to
                    protecting the American people, because the two go hand in hand” (George W. Bush
                    as quoted in <sup><a href="#B10">Desch 2007</a></sup>, p. 22). Clearly
                    evident in this logic is not only an assertion of the concept of the United
                    States as an agent of historical transformation and liberal change in the
                    international system but also democracy promotion as central to US political
                    identity and sense of national purpose. Thus, President Bush stated in 2005
                    that, “America’s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one” (<sup><a href="#B61">Bush 2005b</a></sup>).</p>
<p>Further woven into this sense of responsibility towards US citizens is the theme
                    of sacrifice for the honour and protection of the nation state. This is used
                    primarily in reference to the military and other service officials – such as the
                    fire fighters – involved in counter-terror operations and/or military
                    interventions. Also clearly underscored in this discourse is the incredible
                    spectrum of risks confronting the American nation – from biological and chemical
                    weapon attacks to more conventional terrorism. <blockquote>
<p>“In the three and a half years since September the 11th, 2001, we have
                            taken unprecedented actions to protect Americans. We’ve created a new
                            Department of Government to defend our homeland, focused the FBI on
                            preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken
                            up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses
                            against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and
                            trained more than a half million first-responders. Police and fire
                            fighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working
                            every day to make our homeland safer”</p>

<a name="idp3349952"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">VI.3. Theme III: U.S. responsibility towards international security and its
                    allies</p>
<p>A historic sense of leadership comes through very clearly in the discourse of the
                    GWoT that consistently underscores that this leadership role entails that the
                    United States help maintain security for its allies and friends. Implicit in
                    this historical responsibility of democracy promotion is a normative sense of
                    rightness, superiority, confidence as well as the “assumption that democracy is
                    a universal system” (<sup><a href="#B42">Monten 2005</a></sup>, p.
                    145). Thus, Bush’s 2002 National Security Strategy asserted how American power
                    could be used to create “conditions in which all nations and societies can chose
                    for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty”
                        (<sup><a href="#B67">United States 2002</a></sup>). He also stated
                    in 2006 how: <blockquote>
<p>“America rejects the false comfort of isolationism. We are the nation
                            that saved liberty in Europe and liberated death camps and helped raise
                            up democracies and faced down an evil empire. Once again, we accept the
                            call of history to deliver the oppressed and move this world toward
                            peace”</p>
<p>(<sup><a href="#B62">Bush
                        2006</a></sup>).</p>
</blockquote></p>
<p>This notion that the United States was acting on behalf of not only national but
                    also international interests is, as highlighted above, repeatedly alluded to in
                    the discourse. However, the discourse does not stop at making the connection
                    between national and international security and between security and liberal
                    values. Instead it develops this idea into a full-fledged national
                    responsibility to defend the reputation and credibility of international allies
                    and organisations, with the use of military force if necessary. For instance, a
                    number of decision makers believed that it was imperative that the US rises up
                    to the challenge of defending the “credibility of the United Nations” (<sup><a href="#B42">Monten 2005</a></sup>, p. 148). Rice argued in 2003
                    with reference to Saddam Hussein and the weapons of mass destruction inspections
                    process, “It isn’t American credibility on the line, it is the credibility of
                    everybody that this gangster can yet again beat the international system” and in
                    allowing Iraq “to play volleyball with the international community this way will
                    come back to haunt us someday. That is the reason [to invade] [...] Iraq is
                    critical to re-establishing the bona fides of the Security Council” (Condoleezza
                    Rice as quoted in <sup><a href="#B42">Monten 2005</a></sup>, p.
                        148)<sup><a href="#fn32"><sup>31</sup></a></sup>. But the idea of
                    defending credibility did not apply to international allies alone - the same
                    ideals held true for the United States as well. Thus,
                        <em>credibility</em> was the very foundation upon which the spread
                    of liberal values rested. The logic was that the US discourse of promoting its
                    political values in the international system had to be backed by a willing and
                    demonstrable use of its material power to implement this liberal change when
                    necessary. Thus as Rice stated in 2004, “president Bush’s foreign policy is a
                    bold new vision that draws inspiration from the ideas that have guided American
                    foreign policy at its best: That democracies must never lack the will or the
                    means to meet and defeat freedom’s enemies, that America’s power and purpose
                    must be used to defend freedom, and that the spread of democracy leads to
                    lasting peace” (<sup><a href="#B66">Rice 2004</a></sup>). In other
                    words, the US had to have the will to put its money where its mouth was. This
                    was more than evident in the manner that the WMD-related concessions by Libya
                    were construed as the outcome of a post-Iraq renewal of US credibility in the
                    international system. Bush essentially underscored this stance in his 2004 State
                    of the Union address, when he stated: “nine months of intense negotiations
                    succeeded with Libya, while twelve years of diplomacy with Iraq did not [...].
                    Words must be credible, and no one can now doubt the word of America” (George W.
                    Bush as quoted in <sup><a href="#B42">Monten 2005</a></sup>, p.
                    148).</p>
<p>Closely tied into this idea of responsibility was America’s self-image as a
                    hegemon and a beacon of hope, freedom and liberal values. Hence, as Bush
                    asserted, “I believe that the United States is <em>the</em> beacon for
                    freedom in the world” (George W. Bush as quoted in <sup><a href="#B10">Desch 2007</a></sup>, p. 22). These liberal values and freedoms
                    are necessary to lead the ‘pacific federation’ by setting an example that can be
                    emulated by its allies and imposed forcibly if necessary upon other, non-liberal
                    nations – of course, for their own good. This is very clearly in the Millean
                    vein of ‘barbarians’ having “no rights as a <em>nation,</em> except a
                    right to such treatment as may, at the earliest possible period, fit them for
                    becoming one”. In other words, America’s responsibility lay not only in securing
                    national and international security but also in creating a new liberal,
                    democratic world order (Mill as quoted in <sup><a href="#B26">Jahn
                        2005a</a></sup>, p. 605). <blockquote>
<p>“But America will always stand firm for the nonnegotiable demands of
                            human dignity: the rule of law; limits on the power of the state;
                            respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and
                            religious tolerance. America will take the side of brave men and women
                            who advocate these values around the world, including the Islamic world,
                            because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and
                            containing resentment. We seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war
                            on terror”</p>
<p>(<sup><a href="#B57">Bush

</blockquote></p>
<p>Constant references are made to this union of like-minded states and allies –
                    words used here are coalition, allies and these are presented as upholding
                    liberal values – respecting individual rights and freedoms – as opposed to the
                    barbaric, brutal and oppressive regimes that they are opposing. Clearly Millean
                    language is used as alliances are framed as being composed of like-minded,
                        <em>i.e.</em> ‘civilised’, nations. <blockquote>
<p>“In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries.
                            America is working with Russia and China and India, in ways we have
                            never before, to achieve peace and prosperity. In every region, free
                            markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to
                            lift lives. Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia and
                            Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of terror
                            cannot stop the momentum of freedom”</p>
<p>(<em>idem</em>).</p>
</blockquote></p>
<p>Moreover, as the United States defends and extends liberal values in the
                    international system these allies also come to include non-Western nations such
                    as Afghanistan whose new leaders, in stark contrast to the barbarian ‘other’
                        (<em>i.e.</em> the Taliban), crave the establishment of democratic
                    governments and institutions. Here while the United States adopted a clearly
                    paternalistic stance, in that as world hegemon it accepted the burden of
                    ‘civilising’ these nations, there are also clear references made to
                    post-intervention, self-reliance and self-governance. Therefore, the overall
                    tone is hegemonic but not necessarily imperialistic. <blockquote>
<p>“The American flag flies again over our Embassy in Kabul. Terrorists who
                            once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. And
                            terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are
                            running for their own. America and Afghanistan are now allies against
                            terror. We’ll be partners in rebuilding that country”</p>

                    struggling to survive under illiberal regimes and ideologies</p>
<p>The key words that are used here include ‘freedom’ and ‘liberty’ as brought to
                    people suffering under the yoke of oppression and under authoritarian regimes.
                    The stress in this theme is upon civil liberties and issues such as women’s
                    rights. It is interesting to note how, for instance, the Taliban’s denial of
                    women’s right to education, political representation etc. is used to depict such
                    groups as uncivilised, barbaric, backwards and illiberal and therefore
                    necessitating intervention and removal. Thus, the successful securitisation of
                    the terrorist threat along with the challenges it posed to the freedom and
                    liberty of individuals, who lived in regions governed/controlled by these
                    organisations, facilitated the recourse to military intervention that was
                    founded on a clearly liberal logic of protecting the weak and helpless while
                    simultaneously protecting the ‘pacific federation’. <blockquote>
<p>“The last time we met in this Chamber, the mothers and daughters of
                            Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or
                            going to school. Today women are free and are part of Afghanistan’s new
                            Government. Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan
                            people, to the resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United
                            States military”</p>
<p>(<em>idem</em>).</p>
</blockquote></p>
<p>The sense that the United States would use military might for the benefit of the
                    common man and for the democratic cause is repeated again and again in the
                    discourse. In direct contrast to the empirical realities of ‘collateral damage’
                    in the GWoT, the discourse always emphasises the fact that aim of US military
                    action is to target the oppressive regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq and not its

<p>What comes across quite clearly in this discourse is the United State’s sense of
                    virtuousness. This logic essentially builds upon the ideas mentioned previously,
                        <em>i.e.</em> first, that liberal values and democracy are universal
                    and can thus find expression in US foreign policy and second, that the United
                    States’ efforts to secure its national interests also benefits the oppressed
                    populations of the world. As Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz stated,
                    “Democracy is a universal idea and [...] letting people rule themselves happens
                    to be something that serves Americans and America’s interests as well” (Paul
                    Wolfowitz as quoted in <sup><a href="#B10">Desch 2007</a></sup>, p.
                    22). Also clearly evident in this discourse is the fact that the promotion of
                    democracy was seen as significantly more important for US policy than stability.
                    For instance, Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld dismissed the looting and
                    disorder in Iraq after the 2003 US invasion by declaring, “Freedom is untidy,
                    and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things.
                    They are also free to live their lives and do wonderful things” (Donald Rumsfeld
                    as quoted in <sup><a href="#B10">Desch 2007</a></sup>, p. 24). Desch
                    rightly points out that had the neoconservatives been interested in no more than
                    a pro-US regime in Baghdad they would have been content to replace Saddam
                    Hussein with a more amenable dictator rather than pushing for a democratically
                    elected government, especially given both the commitment and turmoil that the
                    later entailed. In fact, Wolfowitz even stated before the Iraq war commenced
                    that the United States was “not interested in replacing one dictator with
                    another” (Paul Wolfowitz as quoted in <sup><a href="#B10">Desch
                        2007</a></sup>, p. 24). Thus instability was seen as part and parcel of the
                    long march towards freedom and democracy.</p>

<a name="idp3960864"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">VII. Conclusions</p>
<p>This paper analysed the neoconservative practices and discourse of the Global War on
                Terror (GWoT) as seen in the statements made by George W. Bush and other key members
                of his administrations. I began by illustrating how the political roots of what can
                be best terms as the United States’ recent turn to illiberal policy can in fact be
                traced to the philosophical thoughts of Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill. Indeed,
                the language and the logic behind the ‘othering’ and eventual securitisation of Al
                Qaeda/transnational terrorism and its allies are clearly rooted in both the language
                and ideas of Kant and Mill. I also highlighted that the tendency to adopt illiberal
                means to achieve ostensibly liberal ends is not a uniquely neoconservative trait.
                Instead it can be clearly located in American foreign policy since at least the
                beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Thus, by framing Salafi-Jihadism as an
                exceptional act and as such a key existential threat to not only the United States’
                national security but also to the ‘civilised world’ and international and human
                security in general, the United States was able to frame its response as necessary
                war waged in defence of liberal freedoms and values. It was upon this logic that the
                interventions and projects of democracy promotion in Afghanistan and Iraq were
                predicated. These elements of the discourse and practice of the GWoT were
                demonstrated through a thematic analysis of key statements made by President Bush
                and other key personnel in his administration.</p>
<p>Of course, there were certain assumptions underpinning this stance, including the
                notion that liberalism and democracy are universal values as well as the belief that
                the United States was, as the world’s sole superpower, best placed to defend these
                values. This in turn was predicated upon the deeply held political belief that in
                securing its national interests the United States would, as before, also be
                enhancing international security. There is no doubt that implicit in democracy
                promotion was a strategic (some would argue even imperialistic) imperative, however
                there was also a historically rooted, normative sense of rightness and superiority
                evident in the discourse. In other words, it was upon both the material and the
                normative that America’s sense of self-identity was predicated. What this meant was
                that that this particular self-perception deeply impacted how the United States’
                measured its success or failure against the threat posed by the Al Qaeda ‘other’.
                Hence, the various aims under the GWoT – from controlling WMDs and protecting the
                American homeland to neutralising so-called rogue regimes and restricting the
                geographical reach of Al Qaeda to defeating it in the battle of arms and ideas - all
                depended upon the successful projection of US power, in the service of democracy
                promotion, in the international system. This is because it was through the
                establishment of democratic institutions and the protection of liberal freedoms and
                values that all these aims could be achieved. That the United States was willing to
                use armed intervention to achieve this end not only reflected its attempts to secure
                its position of unmatched advantage as the world’s sole superpower but also its
                unique understanding of its exceptional position, rights and responsibilities in the
                post-Cold War world order.</p>
<p>The fact the United States was willing to use what were essentially illiberal means
                to achieve what were liberal ends reflects the deep paradox inherent in liberalism.
                Indeed one could argue that it is at the very intersection of strategic imperatives
                and self-perception that the shift to illiberalism occurred under the GWoT. Thus, it
                was the successful securitisation of Al Qaeda and rogue regimes immediately after
                the 9/11 attacks that first pushed the United States towards defending its way of
                life and the liberal values and freedoms of the international system. In other
                words, it was in the process of attempting to guarantee both its own national
                security while simultaneously also fulfilling its role as hegemon, that it moved
                inexorably towards the adoption of illiberal policies. Internally these policies and
                practices were epitomised in the implementation and re-ratification of the PATRIOT
                act and progressively more significant restrictions on civil liberties in the name
                of national security. Externally, these il-liberal practices were best seen in the
                flouting of established international norms governing the laws of war and the
                progressive erosion of human rights via policies of extraordinary rendition,
                incarceration and torture. Thus, one can argue that, the excesses of Abu Ghraib and
                Guantanamo were made possible <em>because</em> of the paradox inherent in
                liberalism – where illiberal means became acceptable in order to achieve liberal
                ends. The United States, as the perpetrator of these crimes was a liberal actor,
                indeed it was the ‘beacon of freedom’ and ‘the defender of liberal values and
                opportunity’. But it was the deeply rooted liberal tradition within in the United
                States that pushed it towards viewing the threat from Al Qaeda in an alarmist,
                existential light and thus towards adopting what was an illiberal, unrestrained
                policy response. Thus, in viewing itself as ‘exceptional’ the United States not only
                moved towards a pre-emptive unilateralism but also in the course of the GWoT well
                beyond the pale of established international laws and regulations. In short, the
                unfortunate developments over the past fourteen years have essentially brought to
                light what authors like Louis Hartz argued had always rested at the very heart of US
                liberalism: its “intolerance – verging on hysteria – in the face of non-liberal
                ideas and institutions” (<sup><a href="#B24">Hartz 1955</a></sup>).</p>

                    this paper, several established political scientists and International Relations

                    debate on whether or not Immanuel Kant can be categorised as a liberal

                    trace its roots to liberal thinkers like Kant, this is not done to discredit
                    liberalism. Desch, an unflinching realist, constructs this argument to
                    illustrate liberalism’s failures and to argue that realism should be used to
                    check “liberal excesses”. This paper however, uses this argument to illustrate
                    the securitisation attempt that was initiated post-9/11 with the intention of
                    defending the liberal values that the US stands for.</p>

                    is described in his second definitive article and refers to a ‘federation of
                    free states’, <em>i.e.</em> liberal republics which come together in “an

                    with regards to Kant’s categorisation of ‘liberal wars’, <em>i.e.</em>
                    wars fought for freedom, the protection of private property and to aid liberal

                    lies in the disinclination of the latter to exercise a form of ‘colonial rule’
                    over what they see as barbarian, <em>i.e.</em> non-liberal or outlaw
                    states/people. He also draws clear parallels between Mill’s conception of

                    ‘liberal’ in the long term. For a rich, complex picture that depicts various

                    terms “the moral and strategic objectives” of US foreign policy, which cuts
                    across political divisions. The debate has tended to focus on the “policy means

                    outlines in his article (<sup><a href="#B41">Miller 2010</a></sup>).
                    Miller associates defensive liberalism with Kant’s ‘evolutionary liberalism’ and
                    sees it as anti-militaristic/anti-interventi onist, pro-international

                    In contrast, offensive (or Thomas Paine’s revolutionary) liberalism is
                    categorised as reliant upon the “assumed pacifying tendencies of
                    democratisation, displaying a regular willingness to consider the use of force
                    towards that objective” (<em>idem</em>, p. 566).</p>

                    the time we get to the Bush Doctrine, neoconservative thinking had evolved
                    considerably, so much so that it now clearly corroborated the basic realist
                    “hypothesis that variation in political expansion is a function of relative

                    neo-conservatism with liberalism. Instead pointing to its distinctly illiberal
                    elements, including the very un-Kantian trait of unilateralism, they argue it is
                    more akin to a hegemonic form of neo-classical realism, among others using raw
                    power to impose a form of government conducive to American interests. Again, I

                    between the liberals and the neoconservatives is their perspective on the role
                    of international institutions in foreign policy. Thus, many liberals believe
                    that foreign policy is best conducted multilaterally through international

Abstract For many years, the task of teaching in certain academic fields was considered an exclusive attribution of masculine subjects. This essay puts in evidence the female participation in academic teaching in superior theology courses, the power dynamics which cause gender inequality, and the political strategies constructed by women to constitute themselves as female subjects of theological knowledge, in a space historically structured as not intelligible to them. Albeit small in number, the female presence in this field of knowledge is becoming significant by destabilizing a social order that seemed to be sacred and untouchable.

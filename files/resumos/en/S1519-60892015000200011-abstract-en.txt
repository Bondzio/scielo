Abstract: A research was carried out on parturition in order to understand it better. The research aims to understand the meanings/interpretations of childbirth for the health professionals who attended foreign women at a maternity ward in the municipality of SÃ£o Paulo. Documents which informed about live births from foreign mothers were analyzed and interviews were also carried out with health professionals. The outcomes for the studied period indicate that 20% of childbirths were from foreign women, 85% of which were Bolivian. The following issues were discussed in the interviews: the contradictions of the country where there is no discrimination; language barrier and language as a way of approaching; &#8220;submission&#8221; from Bolivian women and cultural differences during childbirth.

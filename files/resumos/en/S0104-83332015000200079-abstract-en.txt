AbstractThis article discusses the agency of spirits and other non-humans in forms of sociability and in concepts associate to movement, time, and space from a village in the north of Haiti. Drawing from an analysis of two social situations, I seek to through light to a political sensibility and a historical depth that are part of the moral and political culture of those living together in the village and those who travel. This is an attempt to contribute to migration and mobility studies calling the attention to how agents build their practices historically and face contemporary situations.

This article discusses the topic of exclusion/inclusion in practices of non-academic education, based on the speeches of educators who work in socio-educational projects for children and youngsters in the outskirts of urbancenters. Considering some results of the empirical research projects Formação de Educadores em Práticas Socioeducativas (Training of Educators in Socio-educational Practices - CNPq) and Saberes sobre Diferenças e Inclusão Social (Knowledge on Differences of Social Inclusion), socio-educational projects are regarded as essentially inclusive actions, naturalizing the phenomenon of social exclusion/inclusion. We propose the expansion of this discussion supported by arguments that suggest the lack of an important foundation, namely the dimension of inequality.

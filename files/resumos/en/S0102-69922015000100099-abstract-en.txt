This paper analyses urban problems in Angola's capital based on two surveys from the end of 1908s: the first one about AngolaÂ´s parallel economy, and more specifically about Luanda's parallel economy, and the second one about urbanization policies in the sub-Saharan African suburbs. It also reviews new research done between 2006 and 2010, focused on understanding the new reality of the region 20 years later, as well as on describing and analyzing the eventual changes and their causes, according to the narratives and practices of the social actors involved. The emphasis of the paper is on analyzing the development of real state generated by the reconstruction of the infrastructures destroyed during the civil war, highlighting repeated disputes between the Angolan State and the populations of citizens disinherited and displaced by war, i.e., the victims of political struggles and violence from different groups from the elite which have been fighting to control the State since independence.

ABSTRACT We discuss how Vale (one of the world&#8217;s largest diversified mining companies) implemented an organizational structure that enabled an open innovation model. We describe the historical perspective in which this process took place. In addition, we present some of the potential causes underlying the slow advance of Brazilian industry in undertaking long-term research and development agendas. Lastly, we list some of the obstacles encountered in this process, as well as some of the potential reasons that might have contributed to the success of the initiative.

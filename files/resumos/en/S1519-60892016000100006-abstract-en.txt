Abstract: In the radical right-wing scene, which is generally regarded as a male-dominated interaction space, women are imperfectly perceived as independent actors. The result is a restricted view of realities within right-wing scenes and thus also of violence committed by radical right-wing women. Based on the analysis of biographical case reconstructions, this article expands stereotyped images in respect of female rightwing radicals and discusses the meaning of violence in their entry and exit processes. It is shown that violent behaviour and attitudes towards violence are shaped by a person's overall biographical history, and serve different purposes that cannot be explained in terms of gender alone.

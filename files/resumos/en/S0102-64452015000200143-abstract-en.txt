This article analyzes the process of constitution of new forms of production and consumption and their relationships. One of the it's main objective is to analyse the role of consumers in the process. The empirical observation of the study was to conduct by analysing two groups of food purchase, one in Italy and the other in the fairs of direct selling in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. We observe the existence of significant differences between these two groups related to the consumption routines by consumers, whose motivations, values and duties related to food and its consumption indicate specific features. One of the contributions of this paper to sociological reflections about food and consumption might be to foster and enlarge the debate about the role of consumers in the production and marketing of food through alternative networks.

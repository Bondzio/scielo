Abstract The present article analyses the debate regarding sexual diversity which took place in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies in 2015, looking at speeches and bills retrieved through the Chamber of Deputies' web portal. The main results we recovered were: speeches against the LGBT Pride Parade in SÃ£o Paulo; propositions against two resolutions issued by the Human Rights Secretariat regarding institutional acknowledgement of gender identity; and bills against the inclusion of &#8220;gender ideology&#8221; in the National Plan of Education. We discuss the content of the debates and the arguments employed in these. We also socially situate the authors of these speeches and bills. Finally, we discuss the fact that the leaders of these debates were congressional representatives with strong religious identities.

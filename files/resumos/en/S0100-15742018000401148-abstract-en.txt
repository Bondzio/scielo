ABSTRACT The educational status of children and young adults with disabilities in social care institutions has been little studied and is a challenge to the inclusive context. This article aims to present the educational status of children and youth with disabilities found in social care institutions. Out of the 48 social care institutions identified, 24 reported having at least one child or young person with a disability. A total of 35 children and young people with some type of disability were found. The majority of children and youth with disabilities study in public schools. The gap between the chronological age and the school year is not significant and, when it exists, is associated more with school attendance than with academic performance.

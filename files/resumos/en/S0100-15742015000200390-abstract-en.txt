This article is an experience report of the extension project conducted with families of incarcerated women in a female prison. The goal was to provide a space to receive people visiting their relatives in that prison. We noticed that many family members experienced the lack or the frailty of social support networks. This study presents three stories of mothers who followed the incarceration of their daughters. These stories point to the need for an articulated action with these networks, and show the limitation of Psychology education, usually focused on the individual removed from his/her social context. The discussion reinforces the need to adopt the principles of integrality and intersectoriality in psychological practices, demanding changes in our education.

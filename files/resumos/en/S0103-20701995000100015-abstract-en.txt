Foucault generates philosophy by investigating history, but is not the author of a "history of philosophy". He does not exclude, however, the philosophical approach: within the texture of his writings on several objects, one finds the thread of a reading of philosophies. Certain specific passages can be pointed out which, by way of illustration, exemplify the Foucaultian reading of philosophers. On the other hand, Foucault does not choose as subject matter a reflection on the history of philosophy. Nevertheless, an approximation with authors who carry out such a reflection allows us to establish certain differences and similarities and to understand that the histories which Foucault writes - pervaded by the approaches of and to philosophers - is vested with a philosophical nature.

Abstract This article proposes an approach to the study of local perspectives and experiences of time in the American austral territories of the Spanish Empire. By examining the record written during the juicio de residencia impeached to a governor of the province of Tucum√°n in 1763-1764, it analyzes in which ways orality and writing operated in the construction and representation of the past, the present and the future. While the trial was celebrated it was also transformed into a written text, leading the words from orality to writing. The article explores how the past was constructed through the oral testimonies, the way the present was configured as a time in which the act of writing fixed that past, and the future became visible by the permanence of the text-object. This approach involves a reflection on the act of writing in which its value is beyond the referential content of the text.

Abstract This article aims to investigate the type of relationship between political clientelism and corruption in contexts of low stateness. The article proposes that both corruption and clientelism are two distinct phenomena with their own characteristics and that although they are distinguishable at the theoretical level, empirical level is difficult to distinguish. In contexts of low statehood a relationship of mutualism is established since the networks that compose them overlap, communicate and benefit each other. In order to meet the research objective, a qualitative methodology was used. Specifically, 30 interviews were carried out in depth (9 municipal authorities, 4 municipal officials, 14 presidents of social and community organizations and 3 suppliers Of goods and services to the municipality). The context in which the investigation was carried out were three municipalities of the Region of the Araucan√≠a in Chile that present a low degree of stateness. The content of the interviews were analyzed from the phenomenological analysis seeking to explain and describe the relations between clientelism and corruption. Among the main results obtained is that there is a type of relationship that can be very beneficial, that is to say, mutualistic, between clientelism and corruption. The article pretends to be an empirical contribution to the discussion about the relations that are established between political clientelism and corruption in certain contexts. At the same time, the concepts of political clientelism and corruption are understood as a social phenomenon that disrupt the formality of processes and therefore are not confined to phenomena that are necessarily linked to illegality. In other words, they are concepts that are understood as being detached from a moral connotation.

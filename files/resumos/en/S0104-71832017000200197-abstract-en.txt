Abstract: The present article discusses how gaúchos and horses share a path of relations which set a common domesticating process, in the universe of cattle breeding in the Brazilian Pampa &#8211; considering such process as part of movements of the economical and political elites with the intention of bureaucratization and rationalization of the work and the production at cattle farming ranches. The idea of &#8220;submission&#8221; of the tamed horses, as a result of the negotiation of forces which involve the use of the techniques called as traditional taming or gaúcha taming, a venture in which the use of brutal force is privileged as a way to &#8220;teach&#8221; the horses, follows the historical bureaucratization of the rural worker in the campeira handling. The ethnographic data on which this research is based were elaborated from field work carried out between the years of 2010 and 2014, with the purpose of subsidizing the analysis of the National Register of Cultural Reference &#8211; Campeiras Handling in the Bagé Region/RS, as well as its developments.

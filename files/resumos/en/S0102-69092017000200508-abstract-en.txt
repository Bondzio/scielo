This paper aims to establish relevant features about social movement made through Twitter, as a result of the protests in Venezuela, during February and March, 2014. This study was part of a qualitative and quantitative perspective research. The main results allow us to observe the emergence of unconventional political participations, at least in the Venezuelan political and social scene, led by mainstreaming contents disseminated by users through the hashtags selected for the development of this work.

This article identifies a conflict between two concepts of ethics in the primary public school curriculum in contemporary Brazil. On one hand, secular ethics, grounded in a transitory political-ideological consensus; on the other hand, religious ethics converging with civic and moral education of a religious nature. This conceptual conflict is explained by the author as the result of a political conflict over autonomy in the educational realm.

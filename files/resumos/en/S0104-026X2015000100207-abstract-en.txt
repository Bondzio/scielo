The present article analyzes the interactions between two collectives of activists/artists, the Queer Women of Color Media Arts Project (QWOCMAP), situated in the United States, and Mujeres Al Borde, situated in Colombia. By focusing on their interaction and addressing the audiovisual productions of the latter group, I discuss how they seek to create relationships between art, activism, audiovisual production, gender, sexualities, race/ethnicities, aiming to create transnational feminist coalitions. The article touches on the following topics: the creating process to developed a cinematic training program in partnership; reflects on the possibilities of thinking about activism and queer theories in Latin American context; and finally examines some of audiovisual productions of Mujeres Al Borde, trying to address what they call as their artivism, neologism that articulates art and activism. The focus here is on the ways in which these collectives are producing networks of transnational collaboration in global geopolitical dissidents' arenas, promoting social change and means of visual expression for LGBTQ communities, cultivating queer feminist social movements in the global north and global south.

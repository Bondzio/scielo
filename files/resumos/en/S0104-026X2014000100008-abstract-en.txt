The cinematographic work of the bengali director Aparna Sen, despite its high techmical and asthetic quality, is virtually unknown in Latin America and Europe. In her long career as filmmaker, she presents works based on daily events (relationships among families and couples) which enables to treat issues that relate to gender differences within an audiovisual landscape that addresses ethnic or religious conflicts as well as environmental destruction. To know and to publicize her work allows to give voice to a generation of Indian women directors who, through their cameras, have not only criticized power relationships, but also shown the importance of solidarity among generations in order to make the world a fairer place.

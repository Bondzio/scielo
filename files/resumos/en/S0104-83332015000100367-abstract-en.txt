I propose to examine how hierarchy is build among associated members from a Brazilian club of crossdressers, using the notions of "real" and "virtual". This club is organized from the internet. I still seek to understand how these concepts impact the negotiations and social relations inside and outside the club in the production of "real crossdressers". I also analyze the extent to which they build different places for different club members guided by the sociological notions of gender, sexuality, stigma and seniority.

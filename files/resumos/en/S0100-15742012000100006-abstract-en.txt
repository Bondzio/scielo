This article analyzes the evolution of young Brazilians' cognitive abilities, as measured by the Program for International Student Assessment - Pisa. The results were very positive. Although it was observed a considerable increase in the percentage of youngsters able to complete the Pisa exam and, therefore, a strong decrease in selectivity, the Brazilian average rose 33 points over the past nine years. The relative position of the Brazil also increased, since the average score rose from 75% to 80% of the one found in the original group of countries that participated in this survey, in 2000. In distributive terms, the improvement was even more prominent in the bottom of the cognitive abilities' distribution: the hundredths in the lower tail distribution in Mathematics had their scores increased by about 70 points, against approximately 30 points found in the hundredths of the upper tail.

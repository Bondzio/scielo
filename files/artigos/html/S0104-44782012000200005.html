Las elecciones que se realizaron todav&iacute;a    bajo el dominio espa&ntilde;ol dieron cuenta de las din&aacute;micas pol&iacute;ticas    de esta forma de gobierno, como la amplia participaci&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica.    Se estudian las elecciones durante las primeras d&eacute;cadas de la independencia,    hasta el comienzo de la guerra con Estados Unidos, y se encuentra que a pesar    de que para los a&ntilde;os treinta del siglo XIX hab&iacute;a una consenso    creciente entre las elites sobre la deseabilidad de excluir a las clases populares    de las elecciones fue imposible mantener las exclusiones censitarias durante    mucho tiempo. Ninguna de las facciones fue capaz de abstenerse de acudir a las    "clases peligrosas". El cap&iacute;tulo da cuenta de las razones de esta imposibilidad.    Existen diversas hip&oacute;tesis para explicar este patr&oacute;n. Se aduce    que en un principio la incipiente apertura de la franquicia obedeci&oacute;    a la competencia entre facciones antag&oacute;nicas. Sin embargo, a finales    de los a&ntilde;os 1820 la movilizaci&oacute;n popular ocasion&oacute; des&oacute;rdenes    sociales, como la destrucci&oacute;n del mercado del Pari&aacute;n, lo que ocasion&oacute;    que empezara a ser vista como disfuncional por las &eacute;lites. A mediados    de los a&ntilde;os 1830 las clases dirigentes decidieron abstenerse de echar    mano de las clases populares en las luchas electorales. Sin embargo este acuerdo    no dur&oacute;, se propone, debido a que los conservadores abandonaron la idea    del sufragio censitario y los liberales, debido a sus triunfos electorales,    renovaron su insistencia en mantener una amplia franquicia.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palabras-llave:</b>    representative government; XIXth century Mexico; voting rights; electoral practices;    political mobilization.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This essay looks    at experiments with a system of representation taking place in New Spain and    later in Mexico. The elections that were carried out during the days of Spanish    rule dealt expediently with the political dynamics of this form of government,    such as broad-based political participation. . We study the elections during    the early decades of independence through the beginning of the war with the    United States, and we find that in spite of the fact that during the 1830s there    was growing consensus among the elites that it would be best to implement censitary    suffrage, the desire to exclude the working classes did not prove feasible.    None of the factions involved were able to abstain from appeals to the "lower    (threatening) classes". We attempt to explain why this was so. There are several    different hypotheses in this regard. One argument is that the early implementation    of sufferage was a result of competition between antagonistic factions. However,    by the end of the 1820s, popular mobilization led to social disorder, such as    the destruction of the Parian market. This stimulated elite preoccupations.    At the beginning of the 1830s, the ruling classes held back on engaging popular    classes in electoral struggles. Yet this agreement proved short-lived, with    conservatives giving up on the notion of census suffrage and the renewed insistence    of liberals, encouraged by electoral triumphs, on maintaining a broad electoral    base.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>Keywords:</b>    Representative Government; Mexico; XIXth Century; Voting Rights; Electoralces;    Political Mobilization.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>RESUM&Eacute;</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cet article analyse    les exp&eacute;riences avec le syst&egrave;me repr&eacute;sentatif, premi&egrave;rement    dans la Nouvelle-Espagne, et au Mexique apr&egrave;s. Les &eacute;lections qui    ont eu lieu encore sous le domaine espagnol ont r&eacute;alis&eacute; les dynamiques    politiques de cette forme de gouvernement, comme la large participation politique.    On &eacute;tudie les &eacute;lections pendant les premi&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies    de l'ind&eacute;pendance, jusqu'au d&eacute;but de la guerre avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis,    et il se trouve que, malgr&eacute; que pour les ann&eacute;es trente du XIX    si&egrave;cle, il y ait eu un consensus croissant entre les &eacute;lites sur    l'envie d'exclure les classes populaires des &eacute;lections, il a &eacute;t&eacute;    impossible de maintenir les exclusions censitaires pendant beaucoup de temps.    Aucune des factions n'a &eacute;t&eacute; capable de s'abstenir du recours aux    &laquo;&nbsp;classes dangereuses&nbsp;&raquo;. Le chapitre essaie de faire comprendre    les raisons de cet impossibilit&eacute;. Il existe plusieurs hypoth&egrave;ses    pour expliquer ce mod&egrave;le. On affirme qu'au d&eacute;but, l'incompl&egrave;te    ouverture de la lib&eacute;ration aurait ob&eacute;i &agrave; la concurrence    entre des factions antagoniques. Toutefois, &agrave; la fin des ann&eacute;es    1820, la mobilisation populaire a caus&eacute; des d&eacute;sordres sociaux,    comme la destruction du march&eacute; du Pari&aacute;n, ce qui l'a rendue dysfonctionnelle    d'apr&egrave;s les &eacute;lites. Vers les ann&eacute;es 1830, les classes dirigeantes    ont d&eacute;cid&eacute; de ne pas utiliser les classes populaires dans les    disputes &eacute;lectorales. Cependant, cet accord n'a pas dur&eacute; et l'on    croit que c'est d&ucirc; au fait que les conservateurs aient abandonn&eacute;    l'id&eacute;e du suffrage censitaire, et encore les lib&eacute;raux , qui auraient    renouvel&eacute; leur insistance &agrave; maintenir une large lib&eacute;ration,    gr&acirc;ce &agrave; leurs triomphes &eacute;lectoraux.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mots-cl&eacute;s:</b>    gouvernement repr&eacute;sentatif&nbsp;; Mexique&nbsp;; XIX<sup>&egrave;</sup>    si&egrave;cle&nbsp;; droit de vote&nbsp;; pratiques &eacute;lectorales&nbsp;;    mobilisation politique.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>I.

No Catholics on earth were so abjectly devoted to their priests,    as blindly superstitious as themselves, and these priests had the powers and    apparatus of the Inquisition to seize every suspected person and suppress every    rising motion. Was it probable, was it possible, that such a plan as &#91;Francisco&#93;    Miranda's, of a free government, and a confederation of free governments, should    be introduced and established among' such a people, over that vast continent,    or any part of it? It appeared to me more extravagant than the schemes of Condorcet    and Brissot to establish a democracy in France, schemes which had always appeared    to me as absurd as similar plans would be to establish democracies among the    birds, beasts, and fishes (ADAMS, 1856, p. 143-145)<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet, by the time    Adams wrote these often quoted lines, Spanish America had already begun to experiment    with the institutions of representative government and highly competitive elections    had taken place in New Spain in 1812. It is indeed an irony that we know as    much, if not more, about elections conducted in New Spain under colonial rule    from 1809 to 1821 than about some periods during the national era<a name="top3"></a><a href="#back3"><sup>3</sup></a>.    Elections were very frequent events in Mexico. A yet to be determined number    (probably ranging in the hundreds) of electoral contests took place at the national,    state and municipal levels during the 19th century. Elections were perceived    by political elites as key to achieving political results, thus tinkering and    experimenting with electoral legislation was very common. No less than forty-six    different statues and laws regulating elections were enacted during the 19th    Century<a name="top4"></a><a href="#back4"><sup>4</sup></a>. If political contest    were, as early scholars thought, decided mainly by military <i>caudillos</i>,    Santa Anna-style, then why was such an enormous amount of energy placed on reforming    electoral laws for a very long time<a name="top5"></a><a href="#back5"><sup>5</sup></a>?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is easy to miss    the significance of regular institutions during an age of political turmoil    and instability. Yet, as Michael Costeloe remarked a decade ago, "during the    so-called age of Santa Anna or three decades from Iturbide to Ju&aacute;rez    there were only four brief occasions on which the executive branch enjoyed unrestricted    dominance. Indeed, one feature of the period, which has been neither analyzed    nor appreciated, is the role of the legislative power, particularly the National    Congress that from 1822 onwards was summoned and met, with one or two gaps,    more or less continuously. In 34 years, between 1821 and 1855, 22 congresses    convened (SORDO, 1994, p. 142-143)<a name="top6"></a><a href="#back6"><sup>6</sup></a>.    Thus, elections took place quite often although they did not always follow a    regular calendar. The forty-six electoral laws are, perhaps, explained by the    fact that many times losers decided to reform the mechanisms for conducting    elections instead of making war. The military certainly dominated the route    to executive authority at both national and state levels through revolt, but    the generals, including and perhaps above all Santa Anna, were singularly unable    to control the National Congress which was always largely composed of popularly    elected civilians" (COSTELOE, 1986, p. 258).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The absence of    a well-documented history of elections in Mexico is to be noted, particularly    at a time when finally the country has become a functioning democracy. Perhaps,    the lack of interest in the electoral processes of the 19th century is due to    the belief that <i>caudillismo</i> and political chaos rendered elections meaningless.    Also, for a long time elections - past and present - were seen by some scholars    as mere manifestations of "formal democracy". For example, in 1985 Gustavo Emmerich    described the "electoral regimes" of the 19th Century as an affair of the "dominant    classes" (EMMERICH, 1985, p. 62). However, very little research has been conducted    to support this claim. Empirical studies at both the national and local level    are missing for key elections during the period. A few recent accounts of electoral    history go beyond these limitations (see, for example, VARELA ORTEGA &amp; MEDINA    PE&Ntilde;A (2000)).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While the period    1867-1910 has received some attention from past and present scholars, our knowledge    of elections between 1824 and 1857 is patchy at best. The period 1808-1824,    which covers the C&aacute;diz experiment in New Spain and the founding of Mexico    has received continued attention. The 1946 seminal work of Nettie Lee Benson    on the 1812 Mexico City election provided a framework for the study of elections    in Mexico (Benson, 1946; 1955; 2004). More recently, Virginia Guedea has studied    the same period as well as the electoral processes of the <i>insurgents</i>    (GUEDEA, 1991a; 1991b; 2001). The latest account of the creation of representative    government in the early period is Alfredo Avil&aacute;'s <i>En nombre de la    naci&oacute;n</i> (AVILA, 1999). Benson's insight that the <i>diputaciones provinciales</i>    created by the C&aacute;diz charter were key to the developing of federalism    in Mexico was followed many decades later by the finding that political fragmentation    and instability was also due to the establishment of <i>ayuntamientos constitucionales</i>    (constitutional townships) provided by the same constitution. Antonio Annino    has extensively developed this line of inquiry (ANNINO, 1995; 1996; ORT&Iacute;Z    &amp; SERRANO, 2007). Lately, Spanish liberalism has also been revisited as    well as the relevance of the political crisis of the Spanish Monarchy (CHUST,    1999; RODR&Iacute;GUEZ, 2005a; 2008; BRE&Ntilde;A, 2006). The local dynamics    of elections have also been researched in some regions, particularly Oaxaca    (BELLINGERI, 1995; ESCOBAR, 1996; GUARDINO, 1998; 2003; 2007; CASTILLO, 2003;    RODR&Iacute;GUEZ, 2005b; SERRANO, 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some studies have    explored the relation between elections and popular mobilization (DI TELLA,    1994; WARREN, 1996; 2001; AVILA, 2004). The dynamics of political disintegration    and the role played by electoral processes have also been explored as part of    a broader account of the period (COSTELOE, 1989, p. 257-275; 1996; 2000). The    period known as the "Restored Republic" (1867- 1876), when the Liberals finally    defeated their Conservative opponents and imposed the 1857 liberal constitution,    is better known. Early scholarship, epitomized by historian Daniel Cos&iacute;o    Villegas stressed the democratic character of the period. Cos&iacute;o believed    that the Restored Republic was an era of unparalleled freedoms (VILLEGAS, 1953;    1957, p. 123-150). However, more recent scholarship is quite critical of the    period. According to Laurens Ballard Perry, elections were subject to constant    manipulation by local and national political leaders. Whenever the President    obtained congressional authorization to resolve political conflicts in the states,    the use of federal intervention and emergency powers was seldom neutral. Ju&aacute;rez,    for instance, ignored requests for federal intervention made by factional enemies,    even when Congress ordered the national government to provide aid. At the same    time, he supported his local allies by decreeing states of siege to allow electoral    manipulation. These resources allowed the executive to obtain the selection    of sympathetic electors, conduct electoral fraud, establish political alliances    and exercise other forms of influence (PERRY, 1978). There are also some new    studies of elections, factional struggles and the press during the Restored    Republic (PALTI, 2003). The role played by electoral laws, particularly by the    initial no re-election law, in the states during the Porfirio D&iacute;az (1876-1910)    era has been explored by scholars (CARMAGNANI, 1986; 1989; 1993; FALC&Oacute;N,    1988). As noted, the early republic has received less attention. Thus this paper    centers on that period.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>II. THE ESTABLISHMENT    OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IN NEW SPAIN 1812-1821</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The case for the    impact of the years 1808-1810 in Spain and America has been made by Francois-Xavier    Guerra (1980; 1992). In considering the transition from colonial rule to independence    in New Spain there were three lasting lessons of the early establishment of    representative institutions. First, elections had the potential of mobilizing    popular participation from all quarters of society, secondly the authorities    organizing the elections could lose them and thirdly the modes of organizing    elections, particularly the indirect system and voter registration would prove    to be enduring.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first elections    in New Spain preceded the 1812 Constitution. As a result of the invasion of    Spain by French troops, a Junta Central was created in 1809 to represent all    the Spanish Monarchy, including the American colonies. Elections of representatives    to the Junta Central were held throughout the Spanish world during the year.    Each province of Spain had two deputies to the Junta Central whereas the nine    American kingdoms were allocated one each.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Junta Central    decreed on January 1, 1810 that elections be held for Cortes. In Europe, each    provincial <i>junta</i> and each city entitled to representation in previous    Cortes would select a deputy. Also, a deputy was to be elected for every 50    000 souls (RODR&Iacute;GUEZ, 2008, p. 105)<a name="top7"></a><a href="#back7"><sup>7</sup></a>.    The Junta dissolved and appointed a Council of Regency, which approved a different    electoral process for America. Unlike the Spanish deputies, American deputies    carried instructions from their provinces. Elections took place in New Spain    starting in June 1810. One point must be mentioned. While the use of lots in    the 1809 Spanish elections has not received much attention, it is significant    from the standpoint of the history of representative government. Indeed, in    the republican tradition lots were frequently used but disappeared at the end    of the 18th century in the Italian city-states. Remarkably, the 1810 Spanish    American elections were the last instance of lots used in the western world.    Guerra asserts that selection by lot was not a republican, but rather a traditional    practice. A way to quell factionalism and also a means to provide for divine    intervention (GUERRA, 1992, p. 192). Yet, this issue deserves further investigation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Cortes promulgated    the Constitution of the Spanish Monarchy on March 19, 1812 and it was sworn    in Mexico City on September 30 of the same year. The constitution enfranchised    all men, except those of African ancestry, vagrants, criminals, debtors, and    domestic servants<a name="top8"></a><a href="#back8"><sup>8</sup></a>. Yet,    the C&aacute;diz constitution firmly established what Manin calls the "principle    of distinction". Representatives were to be different, and superior, to electors.    The constitution provided that deputies should have a rent from personal property    (Art. 92). Even if Art. 93 suspended this provision until future Cortes determined    that the time had come to put it into effect, it is clear that the principle    of distinction was in place (GARC&Iacute;A, 1978, p. 8).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On May 23, 1812    the Cortes issued a decree setting down the instructions for the first elections.    In regard to New Spain, it provided that a meeting of officials should be held    in Mexico City prior to elections. The province of Mexico was to elect fourteen    deputies and four alternates to the Cortes and one deputy and one alternate    to the provincial deputation. The parish elections in Mexico City were set for    November 29, 1812. The provincial electors of the provinces of Mexico were to    meet in Mexico City on February 1, 1813.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Acording to Benson    electoral provisions "were observed in the elections held in Mexico City on    November 29, 1812. Not one judge reported unruliness or disorderly conduct on    the part of the electorate during the proceedings. On the contrary, they unanimously    stated that the parish meetings were executed in the midst of the greatest tranquillity    and order" (BENSON, 1946). All those elected were from well-known families of    Mexico City. However all the electors were American-born or creoles. There were    popular demonstrations of joy that lasted until the next morning (GUEDEA, 2001,    p. 54-56). A few days after the municipal elections newspapers in Mexico City    published critical accounts of the process (BENSON, 1946, p. 342)<a name="top9"></a><a href="#back9"><sup>9</sup></a>.    The daily complained that lists with the names of electors had been widely distributed    beforehand. Also, persons not entitled to vote had participated. The Audiencia    of Mexico complained to the Spanish Cortes in similar terms in November 1813.    It seems that the cause of most of these allegations was that "not a single    European Spaniard nor a single person who supported the Europeans was elected"    (<i>idem</i>, p. 349). Those elected were not followers of the colonial government.    Some were active sympathizers of the rebels. In response to this defeat the    Viceroy suspended the second stage of the electoral process and launched an    investigation on the manner the election had been conducted. Freedom of the    press was suppressed. It was clear that both, the results of the election and    the popular mobilization it produced alarmed the colonial authorities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The November 1812    election was modern in many ways. There were two well organized competing parties:    the American-born creoles and the Europeans. Both followed the same electoral    tactics of distributing lists of candidates to voters beforehand. The factions    employed individuals to distribute their lists among the people. Many voters    did not know the names that were written on the lists they presented. However,    the American faction proved much more effective at this game than its counterpart.    It achieved an absolute victory. The distribution of lists was not illegal under    the constitution although many actors viewed it as collusion. At the same time,    popular participation was extensive and included individuals that according    to the constitution could not vote, such as blacks, castes, domestic servants,    vagrants and debtors (GUEDEA, 1991a, p. 2-15). These individuals wanted to participate    in the election and in most cases were successful. Interestingly enough the    losing side, although in power, did not subvert the process. While the electoral    process was temporarily suspended it resumed eventually. In the end the electoral    organizing of the Creoles prevailed and their faction won again the majority    of electors. It is noteworthy that, according to Guerra, in that early election    most inhabitants in the census of Mexico City were considered citizens (91%).    The franchise was nearly universal. Indeed, 93% of the male population were    citizens (GUERRA, 1999).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The insurgents    also carried out elections in the territories they held; first to elect a Junta    Provincial and, later, a Congress. With some modifications the rebels followed    the C&aacute;diz model (GUEDEA, 1991b, p. 238). Those electoral experiences    will no be discussed here (GUEDEA, 1991a; AVILA, 1999). In 1820 the C&aacute;diz    Constitution, which had been suspended by Fernando VII in 1814, was restored.    The decree calling for elections for the Cortes was published in Mexico on June    3, 1820. A census of voters was made and elections for the Mexico province were    held. As before 1814, the majority of those elected as first degree electors    were Americans. Likewise, when the electors of <i>partido</i> convened to elect    representatives on September 17, 1820 most seats were taken by creoles (AVILA,    1999, p. 190-195). Lucas Alam&aacute;n, the future leader of the Conservative    party, was elected as a representative from Guanajuato. In other provinces elections    followed a similar pattern. The <i>ayuntamientos constitucionales</i> were restored    as well as seven <i>diputaciones provinciales.</i> The elections of 1820-1821    were criticized for technical infractions, "but there were no events similar    to the upheavals of 1812. The most salient characteristic of both the Cortes    and municipal council elections in 1820-1821 was the low voter tournout. Parish    returns showed dramatic absenteeism" (WARREN, 1996, p. 40). Yet, on February    24, 1821 a Spanish army officer, Agust&iacute;n de Iturbide, turned coats and    sided with the insurgente leader, Vicente Guerrero, and declared independence    from Spain. As Warren states, "the ideological debates and electoral experiences    of the independence era strongly influenced the nation's development during    the next generation. Moreover, elites and masses learned that elections could    trigger general political ferment" (<i>ibidem</i>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legacy of the    C&aacute;diz constitution was twofold. On the one hand, the 1812 constitution    provided the frame of an expanded franchise that would be very difficult to    restrict in the new republic. On the other hand the C&aacute;diz scheme of indirect    elections proved to be long-lived. In Mexico, it lasted for many years until    the 20th century. These legacies had significant political consequences. Three    aspects are significant and survived until the 20th century. First, the procedure    that allowed the polling tables to decide, without appeal, any complaint or    issue during the voting. Second, the fact that secondary electors were not bound    to obey primary voters and finally, the role of "jefes pol&iacute;ticos". In    Mexico <i>Jefes politicos</i> became key players after 1857 (VARELA ORTEGA &amp;    MEDINA PE&Ntilde;A, 2000, p. 209-213).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>III. THE SHORT    ROAD HOME: VOTING RIGHTS AND THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The right to vote    did not develop in a straightforward manner in Mexico during the 19th century.    As we have seen, the C&aacute;diz Constitution awarded full citizenship to most    men with "employment, trade or a known way of living" (Art. 25). While the 1812    Constitution did not provide for universal male suffrage (domestic servants,    descendants of blacks and castes were excluded), the electoral procedures permitted    a wide interpretation of the law<a name="top10"></a><a href="#back10"><sup>10</sup></a>.    Once independence was achieved suffrage was granted to citizens over 18 years    of age of all classes and castes, even foreigners. The November 17, 1821 "Convocatoria    a Cortes" to a constituent Congress also broadened the franchise by eliminating    racial requirements for citizenship (GARC&Iacute;A, 1978, p. 29; PANI, 2003,    p. 97-100). Later, when the republic was established, the 1824 federal constitution    left the determination of who could vote to the state legislatures (AGUILAR    RIVERA, 2000, p. 156-157). However, we know that the first state constitutions    (1824-1828) defined citizens as male, ideally <i>pater familias</i>. Nine states    awarded citizenship to married men even if they were under the set age (PANI,    2003, p. 65-113). Men required a known address and a known mode of living. Many    state charters excluded morally of physically unfit individuals: convicted felons,    debtors, drunkards. Eleven states denied citizenship to domestic servants. Only    three states, Mexico, Occidente and Quer&eacute;taro, deprived the clergy of    their political rights. Most states set reading and writing as a condition for    voters and candidates but postponed enforcement until a time (ranging between    1835 and 1850) when enlightenment was widely distributed in the land. As Erika    Pani asserts, some states suspended political rights to "ungrateful children"    to their parents, and to husbands whom left their wives and to professional    gamblers. Vagrants and persons who used to wander "shamefully naked" also were    excluded in some places. In contrast, only six states punished selling or buying    votes with the suspension of political rights. Two states required citizens    to enroll in the militia and only one demanded citizens to register in the municipal    census. Remarkably, only the state of Nuevo Le&oacute;n established that in    "due time" Congress would establish a minimum tax amount to determine eligibility    to full citizenship.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is surprising    since in the 1823-1824 constituent Congress deputies were generally in favor    of establishing a property condition for voters. A 1 000 pesos amount was proposed    by the commission in the draft of the constitution. Yet, two objections were    put forth. First, as in the debates in Philadelphia on the same issue, this    amount was either too low or too high. Therefore, every state was to establish    its own qualifications. As one deputy put it: "it is most convenient that every    legislature enacts its own regulation in accordance to its own climate and circumstances,    since in some states those with a property worth 25 000 pesos will have the    right to vote, while in other states those that have more or less &#91;property&#93;    will have the vote" (AGUILAR RIVERA, 2000, p. 162). Secondly, some deputies    objected to the property qualification because of the unequal wealth distribution    obtained during Spanish colonial rule. Property was in the hands of a few individuals.    Thus, as we have seen it is quite remarkable that once state legislatures drafted    their constitutions they omitted property conditions. For Mexican constitution-makers,    unlike their northern neighbors "political community should not be structured    around property or income, not even around assessable contributions in the form    of taxes &#91;...&#93; neither on enlightenment or civic virtues" (PANI, 2003,    p. 91). As Pani asserts, a good citizen was a morally "good" man, a head of    family, "firm and solvent", known as such by his neighbors (<i>idem</i>, p.    90).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On June 17, 1823    an electoral law<a name="top11"></a><a href="#back11"><sup>11</sup></a> to elect    a new constituent Congress was published (GARC&Iacute;A, 1978, p. 33-42). The    Cadiz arrangement of indirect elections in three degrees as well as the religious    prolegomenon was retained (<i>idem</i>, p. 34)<a name="top12"></a><a href="#back12"><sup>12</sup></a>.    The wide franchise was also kept: all able men of 18 years of age were enfranchised.    However, alleged criminals, debtors, those with an "unknown way of living or    residence" and domestic servants were excluded (<i>idem</i>, Art. 17). Note    that this piece of legislation, <i>unlike</i> the 1812 C&aacute;diz constitution,    did <i>not</i> follow the "principle of distinction". No income or property    qualification was required from deputies. With the exception of age and residence    voters, electors (primary and secondary) and deputies were very much alike<a name="top13"></a><a href="#back13"><sup>13</sup></a>.    Thus, while there were some changes in the electoral law (representation by    classes was eliminated) voter eligibility continued under the terms set forth    by Iturbide<a name="top14"></a><a href="#back14"><sup>14</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No restriction    to the vote was to be imposed until 1836. However, as we shall see, in 1830    some new electoral procedures were put in place at the federal level in order    to achieve greater control of elections. Electoral units were downsized from    large parishes to small <i>manzanas</i> that carried their own primary elections<a name="top15"></a><a href="#back15"><sup>15</sup></a>.    Also officials were appointed to conduct electoral census. These measures attempted    to curb practices which were common, such as the distribution of lists. On November    30, 1836, six years later and a few rebellions, a new electoral law was passed.    Political elites seemed to have reached a consensus: they would abstain from    tapping into the popular classes in their struggles. Only neighbors with an    annual income (rents, salaries) of at least one hundred pesos would now be allowed    to vote (<i>idem</i>, p. 58). Previous exclusions were maintained (domestic    servants, criminals, debtors, clerics etc.) Indirect elections in three degrees    were also preserved<a name="top16"></a><a href="#back16"><sup>16</sup></a>.    Some states had started to impose property or income restriction even before    1836. Between 1830 and 1832 states such as Veracruz and Guanajuato imposed different    restrictions (SERRANO &amp; CHUST, 2008, p. 221-222).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having reached    a provisional agreement regarding the exclusion of the "dangerous classes" it    is sensible to assume that such consensus among the political elites would last    for many years, until democratic pressures resulted in the gradual opening of    the franchise. However, that was not the case in Mexico. Only five years after    the electoral law of November 1836 was enacted a coalition of disgruntled merchants    and generals (among them Santa Anna and Paredes Arrillaga) was formed to oust    (for the second time) President Anastasio Bustamante<a name="top17"></a><a href="#back17"><sup>17</sup></a>.    Santa Anna suspended de 1836 centralist constitution and proposed to convene    a constituent Congress based on a new electoral law. A committee was appointed    to draft the new legislation. The authors suggested that the June 1823 electoral    law "be reinstated because of its 'greater acceptance' among the people. The    more restrictive laws of 1830 and 1836 were reviewed, the motivations of their    perpetrators questioned, and their results condemned. The committee denounced    as 'pretexts of deception' the efforts to blame instability on the 'natural    character' of a new nation, and the laws of 1830 and 1836 were described as    a desperate effort to control, electoral outcomes and deny the popular will"    (OROZCO, 1978, p. 71-80). The electoral decree of December 10, 1841 removed    income qualifications for voters but preserved a property restriction for deputies    (<i>ibidem</i>)<a name="top18"></a><a href="#back18"><sup>18</sup></a>. Small    electoral units, a required census and the distribution of ballots by electoral    commissioners, all provided by the 1830 law, were preserved. Also, there were    some differences in the conditions imposed on primary and secondary electors    (WARREN, 1996, p. 51).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The strategy of    restricting the franchise was not a stable equilibrium among political elites.    In the next five years income qualifications to voters were repealed and adopted    again several times. Why was the consensus to exclude the lower classes from    the elections so weak? Perhaps, the temptation of employing popular mobilization    was very strong. After a few years Santa Anna realized that he was depriving    himself of a valuable weapon: the popular vote<a name="top19"></a><a href="#back19"><sup>19</sup></a>.    Not all the elites agreed on this point. There is evidence that many in the    provinces wanted property or income and literacy qualifications for voters and    candidates and supported the idea of the representatives being restricted to    heads of family (COSTELOE, 1989, p. 260). Other ideas took shape: the departments    now asked for equality of representation regardless of population. They demanded    four deputies from each of the 24 departments regardless of size of population.    The committee adopted many of the suggestions, particularly that population    should no longer determine the number of deputies and that each department should    be allocated four deputies. However Santa Anna did not accept the committee's    report. He instead imposed by decree the electoral regulations of December 1841    that excluded these innovations. Santa Anna "had clearly rejected the demands    from the provinces to restrict the franchise. There was to be no literacy test,    property or income qualification for voters, and had resisted the considerable    pressure to grant equality of representation in the Congress for all departments    irrespective of their size or population" (<i>idem</i>, p. 262). Indeed, Santa    Anna's behavior is difficult to explain. As Costeloe suggest, miscalculation    might be the answer. Santa Anna presumably resisted the pressure of the regions    for a more restricted franchise because he believed that he could and would    win the elections through mobilizing the popular vote despite the fact that    he made no effort to build a political constituency of his own (<i>idem</i>,    p. 269). He was wrong.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Congress met    in June 1842 produced a draft constitution that Santa Anna disliked and, after    a <i>pronunciamiento</i> took place, he closed the Congress in December. The    way was opened for an advisory council chosen by him to endow him with dictatorial    powers. The Junta Nacional Legislativa drafted a centralist constitution, the    1843 <i>Bases Org&aacute;nicas</i>. Under the electoral provisions of the <i>Bases,</i>    Santa Anna was elected President and was inaugurated in 1844. As it had been    since 1830, electoral sections were small (500 inhabitants). A bicameral legislative    was established. Elections were indirect in three stages. Citizenship was restricted    to males, 21 years of age (or 18 if they were married) with an annual income    of at least 200 pesos. Future congresses could adjust this amount to the conditions    of each of the departments to enjoy full rights of citizenship. Registering    in the electoral census, voting and serving were duties imposed on citizens    (GARC&Iacute;A, 1978, p. 80-83). In addition, a condition of literacy would    be added starting in 1850. Secondary electors were required an income of 500    pesos but Congress could change this amount in the future. Deputies had to be    at least 30 years of age and have an annual income of at least 1 200 pesos.    Senators should be at least 35 years of age and have a substantial annual income    of at least 2 000 pesos. The Senate was conceived as representing interests,    similar to earlier Iturbide's proposal. Two-thirds (42) of the 63-members chamber    were to be elected by the departmental assemblies. However, they were required    by the charter to elect five individuals of each of the following classes: farmers,    miners, property-holders or merchants and manufacturers. These individuals were    exempt from the 2 000 pesos income qualification. The remaining senators were    to be former presidents, vice presidents, two-time deputies, ministers, ambassadors,    state governors, bishops or division generals.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Santa Anna ruled    the country until December 1844, when his government was toppled by a coup orchestrated    by disaffected politicians. Congress appointed Joaqu&iacute;n de Herrera in    his place. He, in turn, was ousted in December 1845 by Gen. Mariano Paredes    y Arrillaga. The war with the United States began in 1846 and in April Gen.    &Aacute;lvarez rebelled against the government in the south of the country.    Likewise, on August 6, 1846 Gen. Mariano Salas issued a <i>pronunciamiento</i>    in Mexico City. The Plan de la Ciudadela called for the convocation of a new    constituent Congress. Paredes was toppled on August 6, 1846 in the midst of    the war against the Americans. On August 6, 1846 the <i>convocatoria</i> was    issued. The electoral law to be used to elect the Congress was the June 17,    1823, with certain amendments (<i>idem</i>, p. 111-119). The broad franchise    of the early Federal Republic was reinstated. On August 22, 1846 the 1824 constitution    was restored. Elections to elect an extraordinary Congress were held at the    end of 1846. The electoral law used was the inclusive December 10, 1841 law.    The new constituent Congress restored the 1824 constitution. An Act of Reforms    (amendments) was attached to the charter. The Act of Amedments, authored by    liberal Mariano Otero, was approved on May, 18, 1847. It asserted that: "every    Mexican national, either by birth or by naturalization, of 20 years of age,    that has an honest mode of subsistence, and that has not been convicted of a    criminal offense, is a citizen of the Mexican United States". Likewise, article    2 stated that citizens had the "right to vote in popular elections" (MEXICO,    1847)<a name="top20"></a><a href="#back20"><sup>20</sup></a>. On June 3, 1847,    a new electoral law was passed by the constituent Congress that followed the    provisions of both, the <i>Acta de Reformas</i> and the December 10, 1841 law    (GARC&Iacute;A, 1978, p. 120-122). It established nearly universal male suffrage.    Thus Mexico, Greece and El Salvador, became the only countries "with broad male    suffrage as of 1847" (PRZEWORSKI, 2010, p. 50).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All in all, between    1821 and 1857 income restrictions to voters had been in effect less than nine    years<a name="top21"></a><a href="#back21"><sup>21</sup></a>. Income or property    qualifications were never imposed again in the 19th century. Yet the condition    of "having a known means of subsistence" or an "honest means of subsistence"    was not challenged. The 1857 constitution enshrined universal male suffrage    and provided that the only conditions to citizenship were age (20 years if single,    18 if married) and having an honest mode of living (Art. 34) (GARC&Iacute;A,    1978, p. 55, 155). In the 1856-1857 Constituent Congress there was debate over    the proposal of imposing a literacy condition to the right to vote. Also, indirect    elections were challenged by some constitution-makers. To the question: who    is to control electoral procedures they offered different answers For some,    such as Francisco Zarco and Ignacio Ram&iacute;rez indirect elections deceived    the people. Others, alleged that the time to establish direct elections had    not come, since priests still were very influential with the people (VARELA    &amp; MEDINA, 2000, p. 206). The second group prevailed and indirect elections    were adopted for representatives, justices and the executive, but with one change:    there were to be two instead of three stages (arts. 55, 76 and 92). Indirect    elections in two stages were in place in Mexico until 1911. Thus, for very long    time male universal suffrage coexisted with indirect elections. However, interestingly    enough, after 1857 many state constitutions often provided for direct election:    in 13 states the local Congress and the governor were elected by "direct and    popular vote" (CARMAGNANI, 1991, p. 235)<a name="top22"></a><a href="#back22"><sup>22</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>IV. THE IMPOSSIBILITY    OF THE ELITIST CONSENSUS: ELECTORAL PRACTICES AND POPULAR MOBILIZATION</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In spite of the    fact that the voting franchise was expanded in 1821 and 1823, (with the elimination    of the racial restrictions of the C&aacute;diz charter) at the beginning of    the republican period, participation declined in the first elections as an independent    nation. However, the lack of a racial restriction made possible the careers    of politicians such as Benito Ju&aacute;rez, a Zapotec Indian. For instance,    in the parish of Sagrario of Mexico City 5,392 citizens voted in the 1812 municipal    council primary elections while only 412 persons voted in 1823. Yet, this quickly    changed after 1824. In the 1826 Mexico City's congressional primary election    30 000 ballots were cast in. According to Warren, political ferment, like that    of 1812, was "directly related to the organizing initiatives of an aspiring    elite faction: radical federalists organized in York rite Masonic lodges" (WARREN,    1996, p. 42). It seems that right from the Cadiz experiments mobilization did    not depend on the opportunity to vote, in terms of enfranchisement, but was    instead triggered by party politics. In 1826 Yorkino machinations were extremely    successful as an unprecedented number of ballots were counted, and their candidates    dominated as primary electors. Opponents claimed the yorkinos purchased votes    and used urban mobs for political ends. The Scottish rite followers accused    the yorkinos of purchasing and destroying <i>escoc&eacute;s</i> candidates lists    in poor neighborhoods. The game of mobilizing popular support was played by    the two major political factions. This helps to explain the "size and intensity"    of popular participation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Factional conflict    did no cease after the 1826 congressional elections. It deepened and reached    a climax two years later, in the 1828 presidential elections<a name="top23"></a><a href="#back23"><sup>23</sup></a>.    This election might be considered a "critical juncture". Until that election    both factions shared cabinet posts as well as other power positions in the national    government of gen. Guadalupe Victoria. The yorkino candidate, Gen. Vicente Guerrero,    lost the election and a few months later constitutional regularity broke down    (DI TELLA, 1994, p. 200-225). The <i>escoc&eacute;s</i> Manuel G&oacute;mez    Pedraza was elected President, but before his inauguration took place a revolt    broke out in Mexico City. G&oacute;mez Pedraza was prevented from assuming office    and Congress elected the defeated candidate, Guerrero, as President.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why did Guerrero    subvert the constitutional order? This is a key episode in the development of    elections and representative government in Mexico. A new presidential election    was scheduled in 1832, four years later. In the hotly contested elections of    1826 and 1828 turnout may have been as high as 75% of the adult male population    (WARREN, 2001, p. 164). A possible answer is that, along with yorkino recklessness,    popular mobilization went out of control. Indeed, on December 4 1828, when G&oacute;mez    Pedraza was about to capitulate, and in a frenzy of popular and military resentment    against the Spaniards, "a mob descended on the Pari&aacute;n market and pillaged    its shops as well as a number of homes and businesses elsewhere in the city    center. Estimates of the number of participants in the riot range up to several    thousand. The upheaval drove most people of means off the streets for several    days, including the municipal council officers who were supposed to preserve    public tranquility". Thus, the Pari&aacute;n riot in Mexico City became the    great symbol of 1820s popular radicalism. Conservatives claimed that the Pari&aacute;n    booty was offered as a reward to the poor for supporting Guerrero. The looting    itself confirmed conservative fears of the relationship between popular political    participation and social dissolution, while radicals explained the event as    an "understandable response to three hundred years of Spanish oppression and    the repeated aristocratic conspiracies of the post-independence era promulgated    by those who survived off the sweat of the Mexican people" (<i>ibidem</i>).    Mexico City's largest uprising in over one hundred years came about directly    as a result of partisan politics. Also it came about as the failure of elections    to channel political participation. While the 1828 election was not the first    election in which party politics and mass mobilization intersected (as we have    seen the 1812 election exhibited both traits), it was the first in which losers    had enough incentives (and means) to subvert the process<a name="top24"></a><a href="#back24"><sup>24</sup></a>.    They were indeed successful in their attempt of altering the formal outcome    of the elections. The background of constitutional breakdown was the poor state    of the economy, xenophobic agitation against the Spaniards and miners unrest.    However, many among the political elites saw the Pari&aacute;n riot basically    as the inevitable result of the political enfranchisement of the urban poor.    Something close to a consensus emerged. Thus the movement towards restricting    the vote began.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After Guerrero    was deposed in 1829 by a <i>pronunciamiento</i> in the city of Jalapa the Vice    President, General Anastasio Bustamante, took charge of the presidency and Lucas    Alam&aacute;n became Minister of the Interior. In his first ministerial report    to Congress, submitted in February 1830, Alam&aacute;n singled out the causes    of the ills of the country. The system of elections came only second after secret    societies. Alam&aacute;n criticized that during elections the factions distributed    lists of candidates, secured for themselves the positions of secretary and inspector    at the polling tables, thereafter every person, regardless of qualifications,    was allowed to vote sometimes more than one time. He believed these practices    made judicious men turn away from elections, leaving the field in the hands    of those less able of conducting them with tact. The "spirit of party" went    so far as to consider property and enlightenment as aristocratic and excluding    them from elections. Such qualities were the "sole basis of a truly representative    system" (ALAM&Aacute;N, 1945, p. 183-185)<a name="top25"></a><a href="#back25"><sup>25</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alam&aacute;n was    not alone in his criticism of elections. Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Luis Mora,    a luminary of the liberal party, was very much in agreement with him. Two months    after Alam&aacute;n gave his report, Mora published an extended article in the    daily <i>El Observador</i> in which he argued for the establishment of property    qualifications (MORA, 1994, p. 136-145)<a name="top26"></a><a href="#back26"><sup>26</sup></a>.    Mora suggested a minimum income requirement of 1 000 pesos annually or real    state property worth 6 000 pesos. Such amounts would be cut in half in the countryside    and in towns with less than 10 000 inhabitants. Mora also argued for a uniform    national citizenship. National citizenship would be a requirement to acquire    state citizenship.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, Mora's    proposal was not adopted by the Bustamante government, which had its own ideas    on electoral reform (WARREN, 1996, p. 45). As we have seen, in July 1830 the    government persuaded Congress to pass a major electoral reform bill for the    Federal District and Territories intended to restrict access to the ballot box.    However, no income restriction was adopted. The basic electoral units for the    Federal District were changed from the 14 parishes to 245 small <i>manzanas</i><a name="top27"></a><a href="#back27"><sup>27</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following year    Alam&aacute;n optimistically reported to Congress that the new law had "cut    from the root the abuses in popular elections" (ALAM&Aacute;N, 1945, p. 26)<a name="top28"></a><a href="#back28"><sup>28</sup></a>.    However, as Warren notes, the change in administrative apparatus did not interrupt    the electoral process much at first and the transition to the manzana system    "did not result in an immediate decline in voter turnout, either. Aggregate    turnout in municipal elections was virtually the same in 1830 (12 218) and 1831    (12 581) as it was in 1829 (13 028), prior to the change in the law" (WARREN,    1996, 45-46). Under the new system, however, commissioners fared very well.    In most manzanas the commissioners won the primary elections. In 1831 approximately    45 per cent of the winners were commissioners. Thus this shows that they became    key political operatives. The elections of 1830 and 1831 demonstrated that the    1830 electoral reform "was not sufficient to curtail voter turnout or secure    conservative victory" (<i>ibidem</i>).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1832 municipal    elections of Mexico City prominent liberals claimed that the elections had been    conducted in an atmosphere of fear, which brought into office persons who did    not merit the "confidence of the people". A new revolt staged by a liberal coalition    allied with Santa Anna ousted Bustamante and Alam&aacute;n from power. The new    administration, headed by the Vice President Valent&iacute;n G&oacute;mez Far&iacute;as,    dissolved the sitting municipal council and summoned the 1829 members to return.    Once more, formal results of the elections were reversed. This had an adverse    effect on electoral participation. The 1833 municipal election was "marked by    widespread absenteeism". The new government blamed the 1830 law for the decrease    in participation. Vice President G&oacute;mez Far&iacute;as, a liberal, was    resolved to prosecute the ministers of the deposed Bustamante administration,    in particular Alam&aacute;n, who went into hiding to avoid arrest. There the    ex minister wrote an account of the flaws of the 1824 constitution (ALAM&Aacute;N,    2008)<a name="top29"></a><a href="#back29"><sup>29</sup></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 1833 to 1835    political apathy continued. Electoral reform was a priority in 1835 when the    centralists won power and decided to draft a new constitution. They introduced    the first income restrictions on the suffrage shortly thereafter. Why? Absenteeism    was undeniable. In the 1835 Mexico City elections only 32 manzanas out of 60    held elections. According to the electoral census, turnout was 23.6%. In the    manzanas that had elections turnout was 27.7%. However the key was in who voted.    According to Warren, the breakdown of voters by profession shows a surprising,    but undeniable pattern: "there was a high participation rate by poorer artisans    and manual laborers. Shoemakers and carpenters as well as load bearers, water    carriers and bricklayers voted in significant numbers. In manzanas with elections,    more than 47% of water carriers and more than 37% of carpenters and bricklayers    cast votes, versus the overall voter turnout of 27.7%" (WARREN, 1996, p. 47)<a name="top30"></a><a href="#back30"><sup>30</sup></a>.    In 1835 the main electoral constituency were the poor.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Elections were    seen by many prominent actors as key to explaining the ills of the country.    By early 1846 Mexico had been celebrating elections for more than 30 years.    In 1836, after 15 years of experimenting with an expansive franchise, Mexican    elites decided, for the first time, to impose income or property qualifications    for voters. At the beginning of the early republican period representation was    so democratic that not even the principle of distinction, key to representative    government, was followed. This is quite different from what happened in older    representative governments. In Mexico City turnout for municipal elections in    the period from 1829 to 1831 hovered around 27% of the city's estimated total    male population (<i>idem</i>, p. 161). It had taken years to political elites    to agree on the need to restrict the franchise. Much had been expected from    elections. Now, a peculiar disbelief captured the minds of some long-standing    observers and participants. The prospect of reforming the electoral system looked    grim. Adopting long overdue income restrictions to the franchise had clearly    not been enough to "fix" the system. Besides, as events had shown, such restrictions    did not constitute a stable equilibrium, since many political actors from all    factions had incentives to deviate from it. Mass politics was a valuable resource    and it was hard to abstain from it. Thus, Alam&aacute;n and other conservatives    reached the conclusion that not even indirect, income-restricted, elections    would do. They believed that something else had to be tried, a new system different    from those of England, the U.S. and France. In designing this original system    he tapped into ideas of class and interest representation already contained    in the 1821 Iturbide's convocation and in the 1843 <i>Bases Org&aacute;nicas</i>.    Only this time he took his proposal even farther away from standard theories    of representation (V&Aacute;ZQUEZ, 1999, p. 122). To preserve order and stability    a corporatist representation system would be established<a name="top31"></a><a href="#back31"><sup>31</sup></a>.    This project was afforded little time since as we have seen, the Paredes government    was ousted only seven months after the publication of the convocatoria. The    federal republic - and its electoral regime - were restored. Alam&aacute;n saw    these developments as a return to the stormy 1820's, an era of mass elections    that he decried. Riots had gripped Mexico City in 1838, 1841 and 1844 (WARREN,    1996, p. 169). Further radicalization ensued in the following years. Thus, four    years later, in 1853, he complained to Santa Anna that the conservative party,    which he now led, was set against the representative system, "against elective    townships, and against everything called popular election until the time where    they lay on a different foundation" (ALAM&Aacute;N, 1986, p. 313-17).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>V. CONCLUSIONS:    MACHINE POLITICS IN MEXICO</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the Reform    War (1857-1861) and the fall of the Second Empire (1863-1867) liberals enjoyed    political supremacy. As we have seen, from the beginning of the republican period    an expanded franchise was the product of political competition between the elites    that actively used the popular classes in the factional struggles. However,    elites also wanted to preserve control over electoral process, thus the long-lived    system of indirect elections. This case seems to run counter to some social    science explanations of how the franchise expanded (ACEMOLGLU &amp; ROBINSON,    2006). During the era of the Restored Republic (1867-1876) elections became    contests between the federal and local governments. The electoral system empowered    local authorities, since prior to the biennial federal elections, the municipal    councils designated the electoral census takers, polling sites, and a citizen    charged with setting up the polling table (VARELA ORTEGA &amp; MEDINA PE&Ntilde;A,    2000, p. 210-211)<a name="top32"></a><a href="#back32"><sup>32</sup></a>. Thus    the national government competed with local politicians for the control of voters    and electors. Presidents during the Restored Republic need governors if they    wanted to be reelected. Some governors cooperated, other did not. When presidents,    such as Benito Ju&aacute;rez, faced a hostile governor they frequently resorted    to military intervention to depose it and place a factional ally. Governors    were key to decide elections because they in turn controlled the "jefes politicos",    officials created by the C&aacute;diz constitution that had authority over local    mayors. Juarez and his ally, Sebasti&aacute;n Lerdo de Tejada, controlled the    majority of governors. In this way they were able to prevent D&iacute;az, who    had few governors, from winning an election. The result was the failed 1871    D&iacute;az rebellion. A key complaint was that Ju&aacute;rez used his factional    allies to make a travesty of elections. D&iacute;az could not defeat the electoral    machine. Thus, as Medina asserts, the D&iacute;az 1871 and 1876 rebellions,    as well as the 1910 Francisco I. Madero revolution, were directed against the    "use and abuse" of electoral rules. In 1876 Ju&aacute;rez was dead and Lerdo    could not keep the machine together. Fraud prevailed and D&iacute;az rebelled    again, this time he was successful in toppling the government. He would construct    his own electoral machine that lasted for 34 years, until it, too, crashed.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>REFER&Ecirc;NCIAS    BIBLIOGR&Aacute;FICAS</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ACEMOGLU</b>,    D. <b>&amp; ROBINSON</b>, J.

I would also like to thank Alfredo &Aacute;vila, Eduardo Posada,    Samuel Valenzuela and Jorge E. Rodr&iacute;guez for their detailed comments    and suggestions.    <br>   <a name="back2"></a><a href="#top2">2</a> Letter to James Lloyd, March 27, 1815,    The key reason for Adams' skepticism regarding the possibilities of democracy    in South America were the deleterious consequences of religious intolerance.    <br>   <a name="back3"></a><a href="#top3">3</a> The C&aacute;diz Constitution was    in force in New Spain very few years: 1812-1814, and 1820-1821.    <br>   <a name="back4"></a><a href="#top4">4</a> For a compendium of electoral laws    in Mexico during the 19th Century, see Orozco (1978).    <br>   <a name="back5"></a><a href="#top5">5</a> During the colonial period (1812-1821),    there were six statues, Independence and First Empire, (1821-1823) there were    two, during the First Federal Republic (1824-1835) there were four, during the    Central Republic (1835-1846) there were 11 laws, during the Second Federal Republic    (1847-1854) there were 10 statues, during the Ayutla period (1854-1857) there    were two laws, during the formation of the Liberal Republic and until the fall    of the Second Empire (1857-1867) there were four laws, during the Resto red    Republic (1867-1876) there were eight laws and during the rule of general Porfirio    D&iacute;az in the 19th century (1876-1900) there was only one law enacted,    the law of December 16 1882, "Decreto que reforma la ley electoral de 12 de    febrero de 1857". This pattern needs to be explained.    <br>   <a name="back6"></a><a href="#top6">6</a> Note that if congress was renewed    every two years (as provided by the 1824 Constitution) and a normal calendar    had been observed for the period, there would have been 17 congresses elected    between 1821 and 1855. Yet, there were five more than expected.    <br>   <a name="back7"></a><a href="#top7">7</a> According to Rodr&iacute;guez, those    elections were based "on the municipal elections of <i>diputados del com&uacute;n    y s&iacute;ndicos personeros</i> introduced by Carlos III in the municipal reforms    of 1766" (RODR&Iacute;GUEZ, 2008, p. 105).    <br>   <a name="back8"></a><a href="#top8">8</a> Spaniards of African descent could    become citizens by means of "virtue and merit" (Art. 22).    <br>   <a name="back9"></a><a href="#top9">9</a> "Sobre el nombramiento de elecciones    municipales", <i>El amigo de la patria</i> quoted by Benson (1946, p. 342).    <br>   <a name="back10"></a><a href="#top10">10</a> The articles on citizenship were    strikingly vague. Citizens were defined as those who "have their origin in the    Spanish dominions of both hemispheres" and were settled in any village. Since    there was no voter's list and the <i>vecinos</i> at the polling table were the    ones who determined who could vote the result was virtual universal male suffrage.    From the records of the 1812-1814 elections we can see that few voters were    turned down at the polling tables. Meanwhile, as we have seen a standard complaint    of that period was that ineligible people voted at the elections. Note however,    that in theory this procedure could have worked the other way around, restricting    suffrage.    <br>   <a name="back11"></a><a href="#top11">11</a> It was callded "Bases para las    Elecciones del Nuevo Congreso", of 17 June, 1823.    <br>   <a name="back12"></a><a href="#top12">12</a> Art. 13 "Ser&aacute;n precedidas    de rogaci&oacute;n p&uacute;blica en las catedrales y parroquias, implorando    el auxilio divino para el acierto" (GARC&Iacute;A, 1978, p. 34).    <br>   <a name="back13"></a><a href="#top13">13</a> Art. 69: "To become deputy it is    required to be a citizen in good standing, over 20 years of age, born in the    province or having been in residence for at least seven years". Lay persons    as well as secular members of the church, members of the provincial Junta as    well as non members could become deputies. Oddly enough, there were more restrictions    for secondary electors than for deputies. Secondary electors had to be at least    25 years of age with a five year residence in the "partido". Civil, military    and e cclesiastic magistrates were excluded as well as priests. Primary electors    had to be at least 25 years of age (or 21 if married), neighbor and resident    of the municipality. Civil, military and ecclesiastic magistrates were excluded    as well as priests. However, elected authorities, such as mayors, were eligible    (G&Oacute;MEZ, 2005, p. 36-37, 39). The 1823 law imposed more conditions for    primary electors than those imposed on parish electors by the 1812 C&aacute;diz    Constitution (on which it was modeled after) which (Art. 75), only required    full citizenship, 25 years of age and the condition of neighbor and resident    (Art. 45). According to the Spanish Constitution, secondary electors, in addition    to the requirements for primary electors, could be laymen or secular ecclesiastics.    Members as well as non-members of the partido Junta could be elected.    <br>   <a name="back14"></a><a href="#top14">14</a> When the idea of electing a constituent    congress was discussed in 1821, Iturbide proposed that the assembly be filled    with representatives of different "classes" according to their importance and    influence. The assembly would be composed of 114 citizens plus nine clergy,    nine military, nine magistrates, nine lawyers, two farmers, two employees, two    artisans, two miners, one "title" and one <i>mayorazgo.</i> This design sought    to include significant interest groups. Oddly, this proposal was neither traditional    nor modern. It was not Spanish corporatist but clearly was out of touch with    modern representative government.    <br>   <a name="back15"></a><a href="#top15">15</a> A "manzana" was roughly a city    "block".    <br>   <a name="back16"></a><a href="#top16">16</a> Indirect elections remained in    place in Mexico until 1911. The three-stage C&aacute;diz model was in place    until 1857 and from then on there was a two-stage system (VARELA ORTEGA &amp;    MEDINA PE&Ntilde;A, 2000, p. 208).    <br>   <a name="back17"></a><a href="#top17">17</a> Bustamante was in power for the    first time between 1830 and 1832 (January 1, 1830 to August 30, 1832), later    in 1837 he was elected to the presidency. He served as President, from April    19 1837 until September 22 1841 with a brief four months interruption (March    18, 1839 to July 18, 1839), when he was toppled by Santa Anna and Paredes Arrillaga.    <br>   <a name="back18"></a><a href="#top18">18</a> An exclusion was added: regular    clergymen could not vote. Primary electors, unlike regular citizens, had to    be at least 21 years old, they had to be neighbors and residents of the municipality    and magistrates were excluded. Besides these qualifications, secondary electors    had to be at least 25 years of age and residents for at least one year in the    municipality. Finally, deputies had to have two years of residence and an annual    income of at least 1 500 pesos. Married men, widowers and heads of families    were to be preferred to single men (OROZCO, 1978, p. 74-77).    <br>   <a name="back19"></a><a href="#top19">19</a> However, if this is the case why    was the income restriction to candidates preserved?    <br>   <a name="back20"></a><a href="#top20">20</a> "Art. 1&deg; Todo mexicano, por    nacimiento &oacute; por naturalizaci&oacute;n, que haya llegado &aacute; la    edad de veinte a&ntilde;os, que tenga modo honesto de vivir, y que no haya sido    condenado en proceso legal &aacute; alguna pena infamante, es ciudadano de los    Estados-Unidos Mexicanos. Art. 2&deg; Es derecho de los ciudadanos votar en    las elecciones populares, ejercer el de petici&oacute;n, reunirse para discutir    los negocios p&uacute;blicos, y pertenecer &aacute; la Guardia Nacional, todo    conforme &aacute; las leyes. Art. 3&deg; El ejercicio de los derechos de ciudadano    se suspende por ser ebrio consuetudinario, &oacute; tahur de profesion, &oacute;    vago; por el estado religioso, por el de interdicci&oacute;n legal; en virtud    de proceso sobre aquellos delitos por los cuales se pierde la cualidad de ciudadano,    y por rehusarse, sin excusa leg&iacute;tima, &aacute; servir los cargos p&uacute;blicos    de nombramiento popular" (MEXICO, 1847, arts. 1-3).    <br>   <a name="back21"></a><a href="#top21">21</a> Property restrictions were in place    in Mexico during the central republic during the following periods: between    November 30, 1836 and December 10, 1841 and between June 14, 1843 and August    6, 1846.    <br>   <a name="back22"></a><a href="#top22">22</a> Even before 1857, in the first    state constitutions of the 1820, there were some departures from the Cadiz model.    For instance, there were different mechanisms to elect governors. In some states    the local executive was elected by municipal councils (<i>ayuntamientos</i>),    while in others it was elected by the local congress and yet in others it was    elected by electoral colleges.    <br>   <a name="back23"></a><a href="#top23">23</a> While the executive was chosen    by the state legislatures, "the uses of popular pressure had become an essential    element of contemporary politics" (WARREN, 1996, p. 44).    <br>   <a name="back24"></a><a href="#top24">24</a> Nothing comparable to the Pari&aacute;n    riot came about even during the more critical moments of the November 1812 election    in Mexico City.    <br>   <a name="back25"></a><a href="#top25">25</a> Often men were elected who did    not depend on society by any bond, and whom "having nothing aspired to gaining    everything" without scruples. Because of these facts, Alam&aacute;n, asserted,    elections often lacked legitimacy. Since political authority had been weakened    by revolution only "immaculate" electoral processes could endow such authorities    with sufficient legitimacy.</font>    <br>   <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="back26"></a><a href="#top26">26</a>    Mora blamed much of Mexico's instability on a misguided notion of equality.    There had been a "scandalous profusion" of political rights that had allowed    even the lowest classes of society participation in elections. Spain, Portugal,    Naples and "all the new republics of America that adopted the principles of    the Spanish constitution of extending the exercise of political rights to non    property holders have marched relentlessly from one revolution to the other"    (MORA, 1994). In contrast, Mora admired the electoral systems of the United    States, Britain and Holland because of the stability of those systems which    he attributed to a restricted franchise. Mora published a series of interesting    articles regarding elections: Mora (1830a; 1830b).    <br>   <a name="back27"></a><a href="#top27">27</a> Under the new system, each of the    245 manzanas would have its own primary election, "short-circuiting the mass    production of printed candidates lists and the possibility of gathering large    groups at the polls". Moreover, each manzana would have one electoral commissioner,    an official designated by the municipal council to conduct a neighborhood census    and distribute ballots to eligible voters well before election day. This measure    was designed to cut down on multiple voting by individuals and ineligible persons.    The municipal council now controlled the appointment of electoral commissioners,    who in turn conducted the electoral census, handing out or denying ballots "to    whomever they chose and, significantly, reporting vagrants (whom would not be    able to vote) to the police" (WARREN, 1996, p. 5).    <br>   <a name="back28"></a><a href="#top28">28</a> While the law had some flaws these    would in time be corrected. The problem now, he pointed out, was that voters    did not vote. To correct this he proposed to fine absentee voters. Alam&aacute;n    proposed to fine absentee voters with 2 to 10 pesos.    <br>   <a name="back29"></a><a href="#top29">29</a> In his account Alam&aacute;n sided    with Mora. Income or property restrictions to voters were never as necessary    as when a new nation adopted the representative government for the first time.    He also criticized indirect elections. As a filter of the popular will they    were useless, he argued, since the qualifications for primary and secondary    electors were the same.    <br>   <a name="back30"></a><a href="#top30">30</a> "Ley sobre elecciones de diputados    para el Congreso general, y de los individuos que compongan las juntas departamentales"    (GARC&Iacute;A, 1978, p. 58).    <br>   <a name="back31"></a><a href="#top31">31</a> The proposed electoral system was    detailed and extremely complex. Congress would be composed of 160 deputies to    be distributed among nine different classes: country and urban property and    agricultural industry, (38 deputies) trade (20 deputies), mining (14 deputies),    manufacturing (14 deputies), literary professions (14 deputies), magistracy    (10 deputies), public administration (10 deputies), clergy (20 deputies) and    the Army (20 deputies).    <br>   <a name="back32"></a><a href="#top32">32</a> The polling station was completed    with the first seven citizens that showed up. These citizens designated a President,    a secretary and the inspectors. The officials took the ballots where the citizens    had written the names of their preferred elector. Following the Cadiz model,    the polling table could decide, without appeal, any complaint on the election.    After these vote section electors traveled to the capital of the district. There    they voted with secret ballots to elect the deputies. Candidates had to carry    an absolute majority of electoral votes. Similar procedures were followed in    the election of President and justices of the Supreme Court. Once the deputies    were elected the documentation was sent to the Chamber of Deputies that passed    judgment, as electoral college, on the election. With minor changes these procedures    were in place until 1911. In 1874 the Senate was restored.</font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

This investigation arose as a central objective to unravel the / those model (s) of science and the praxiological models that underlie the training processes of education professionals from a center of higher education studies in order to take into account current professional models and establish possible relationships between these theoretical models and practical models, using a qualitative and interpretative methodology. The results showed that there is a relative coexistence between professional models with a cognitive and constructivist reference point, endorsed by a paradigm shift that moves from positivism to interpretation.

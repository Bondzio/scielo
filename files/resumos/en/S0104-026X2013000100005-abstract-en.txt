This article analyses different approaches of the connection between autonomy, oppression and identities in feminist political theory. Starting from the concepts of "lived body" and "lived knowledge", it discusses the possibilities of resignifying experiences and autonomously defining identities in social contexts where inequality prevails. It focuses on the fact that identities, although important to the individuals, may reproduce values which are the basis for subalternity, justifying the present forms of oppression. On the other hand, it considers how individuals would actively answer to the restricting alternatives offered by the power structures, being able to confront and redefine them. In this way, it considers theoretical alternatives in those approaches that permit to surpass the duality between autonomous choices and coercion.

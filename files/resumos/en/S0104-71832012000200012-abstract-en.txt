In this article I propose to considerer people who manage the cultural politics of reading as part of "new cultural intermediaries". These intermediaries are designated as mediators and also as under others terms that relate them to knowledge, conceptions and the daily tasks they carried out, like librarians, heads/as, employees, mediators, reference librarian, volunteers, members, and associations officers. However, these intermediaries have inscriptions and economic and symbolic recognition vastly different and unequal, assign them as mediators reduces the relevance of their institutional rol in the cultural sector.

Its founders declared       grandiose political intentions to the detriment of localized more palpable       objectives. Thus, there was a marked disparity between the ambitious mandate       and the political discourse about the commission, and its actual achievements. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Keywords</b>: Human rights, transitional   justice, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, South Africa</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Prologue:   ethnographic note</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the same day that I arrived in   Johannesburg to start my research about the South African Truth and Reconciliation   Commission (TRC), in August 2008, I was invited by my hosts to a dinner with   friends. The first night in the city gave me a clear idea of just how alive and   controversial my theme of research was, even ten years after the Commission ceased   its activities. In a restaurant in a wealthy neighborhood of the city, an   unexpected gathering brought together friends of friends. On the long table   that formed, there were only whites, with the exception of a South African born   and raised in Soweto, who was sitting opposite me. We started a casual   conversation about the city and the weather, which then unfolded into brief   narratives about work and profession. On the topic of my visit to the country,   I explained the intentions of my research to him, to which he expressed a strong   opinion: that the Commission is responsible for a large part of the problems   facing the country, even today. This harsh assertion triggered instant   reactions from other people in the group, who until that moment had not been   part of the conversation. One middle-aged white woman inquired, in a calm   manner, "what would be the alternative for the government? Vengeance? Revenge?"   This inquiry provoked the fury of my interlocutor. According to him, the granting   of amnesty to individuals knowingly involved in brutal crimes against humanity had   corroborated a culture of civic irresponsibility in the country. As an example   of this, he quoted the case of Winnie Mandela, a case which national television   and radio networks accompanied for over eight consecutive years. Mandela's   ex-wife was accused of being involved in the murder of a 14-year-old youth   accused of being a police informant, but had persistently denied the crime, in   spite of evidence and testimonies that unequivocally implicated her. Desmond   Tutu, archbishop of the Anglican Church who presided over the work of the   Commission, had encouraged an act of forgiveness in which the mother of the   adolescent publically pardoned Winnie for the crime, despite the refusal of a   confession. For the black youth of Soweto, that episode would become the symbol   of the political mistake of the Commission: adjusted to the political   conveniences of the situation, it had left a legacy of impunity for the new   democracy. The new era of politics had not established a clear break with the   oppressive past.&nbsp; </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The end of his indignant speech revealed   dramatic information about his origins: "I am tired of pretending that my life   started 10 years ago &#91;an imprecise reference to the years of democracy in the   country&#93;; my life started 33 years ago with my mother raped by a white   policeman".</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The practices of racial segregation in the   southernmost part of the African continent were legally formalized when the   English, after dominating the old Boer republics, founded the Union of South   Africa in 1910. Instituted in 1948, the apartheid regime (or 'separate lives',   translated from Afrikaans) was a corollary of a model of social hierarchy which   ranked whites, coloreds<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a>,   Asians and blacks, in that order. The distinction between these groups was ensured,   for example, through the criminalization of inter-racial marriages and through   differentiated policies regarding land access, remuneration and transport. It   was the blacks, lowest in the regime's racial scale, who bore the brunt of the   most severe measures of social control, such as forced removals, strict   controls on urban mobility, labor market restrictions to manual work and the   restriction of housing to specific regions in national territory, according to ethnic   origins ascribed by the regime and in disregard of individual and family   histories. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first free elections in South Africa took   place in April 1994, when the election of Nelson Mandela to the national government   marked the end of differentiated citizenship as a political principle. Despite   the clear sense of rupture involved in the change of regime, the extensive elections   resulted from a process of negotiation with the political actors in decline. In   the new balance of power, the conservative forces of apartheid did not   completely leave the scene: they maintained representation in the government   and in parliament. The powerful idea of South African national unity, in contrast   to the radically divisive rhetoric of the previous model, precisely envisioned   this kind of an inclusive perspective, committed to institutional guarantees   for the new role of whites. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this political paradigm, the harsh principle   of retribution was avoided with regard to former rights violators. The adoption   of a punitive policy would compromise the negotiated peace process and would   add further tension to the uncertain course of democracy in the country. For   Alex Boraine, Methodist minister who fought against apartheid and one of the main   visionaries behind the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the generals   of the old regime would not accept proceedings against them (Boraine, 2000: 67).   Nahla Nvali, also linked to the defunct TRC, argues, along the same lines that   "the threat of criminal proceedings against the old guarding apparatus of   apartheid security implicated the very real possibility of an outbreak of bloody   civil war" (Nvali, n.d.). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among those following this cautious   perspective, the new government could not disregard the tacit condition put   forward by the military, namely, the refusal of criminal proceedings against   them. And yet, it had to create a sense of legitimacy for the new democracy. Therefore,   it had to find an institutional path distinct from that of international   tribunals, which occupied an important place in the political imaginary of the   time. Among other reasons, this was due to the experience of the International   Tribunal of War Crimes in Rwanda, established in the same year as the free   elections in South Africa. The tribunal's focus on clarifying past events, attributing   blame and applying rigorous punishments, ran contrary to the conciliatory   intentions of the new government. According to Babu Ayindo, this type of forum   was caught up in procedures of excessive formalism, leaving no place for   ambiguities in the discourse and for expressing sentiments (Ayindo, 1998). It was   a counter-model to what was intended by those in charge of new democracy in   South Africa. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the paradigm of retributive justice, focused   on punishing the aggressor, was not suited to the conciliatory character of the   transition government, neither was an indiscriminate amnesty, which suppresses   punishment, suited to it. For citizens victimized by the regime, a "national   amnesia about the past", in the words of Nvali (n.d.), "was also unacceptable".   Retribution or unconditional forgiveness, on either extreme of the spectrum of   possibilities, directly collided with the political interests and expectations   of whites and blacks, respectively. The political ideal of redefining relations   between them &#150; and also between other segregated groups &#150; could not neglect any   of the parts in question. In this context, the TRC emerged as a "solution of   compromise" (Nvali, n.d.). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This article is dedicated precisely to recounting   this institutional experience, the principal initiative of Nelson Mandela's   government to manage the social resentment inherited from the segregationist   regime. Alongside an examination of key works in the diverse literature &#150; which   include texts both exalting and strongly criticizing the Commission &#150; I conducted   interviews with South African intellectuals committed to the theme of transitional   justice and also with key personalities who played a part in this process, and   were situated on different points of the political spectrum at the time.&nbsp; The   short time of research <i>in situ</i> did not allow me to access and gather the   testimonies of Commission deponents. In order to address them, I had to depend   on fragments of interviews in works already completed and published, duly referred   to throughout this article. Given the decision to take a comprehensive approach   towards the Commission and bearing in mind the diverse points of view that   exist about it, I was also not able to select my interviewees in a manner that   presupposes them to be representative of the social groups they belong to. The   interviews which I use in this article therefore form a collection of   individual narratives of people who occupied and/or occupy a key place in their   respective fields of study and/or activism. Although the narratives of individual   personalities do not allow me to generalize about their class contexts, they   form an important part of this descriptive and analytical exercise about the symbolic   institution of political transition in the country. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With that said, the first section of the   article is dedicated to the creation, the structure and the justification of   the TRC, based, above all, on the narratives of Desmond Tutu (2000) and Alex   Boraine (2000), two of its founding-fathers. The three consecutive sections map   out the principal critiques of the Commission, referring to the three different   political groups involved in the political transition. The first of these, the   military critique, brings in a perspective that is absent in the literature   about the Commission, which I sought, in part, to reconstruct based on   interviews with Deon Fourier, colonel of the defunct voluntary army of South   Africa, and Deon Mortimer, representative of the South African Armed Forces in   the Commission. Mortimer (2008) demonstrates his aversion to a production of   memory which would be biased in favor of former opponents of the regime. For   him, forgiveness on its own would imply an unjust attribution of guilt.   Although his personal narrative cannot be taken as the official military   perspective it is important to underline his role as their representative in the   Commission hearings. Moreover, it is quite possible that his views reflect widely   held views in the military which, generally speaking, were not publically   pronounced in the post-apartheid period. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second body of criticisms directed at the   Commission, which this article considers, comes from human rights activists who   were dissatisfied with the abandonment of retributive justice as a principle, and   with the disregard of racism as a political crime. Subsequently, I will   highlight the reactions of the third group, leaders of the African National   Congress (ANC), a political party of the new democracy bringing together former   anti-apartheid activists. In their view, the Commission had taken on the   unjustified practice of assuming 'moral equivalence' between former supporters   and opponents of the regime. With regard to this disagreement between the ANC   and the Commission, I furthermore consider Tutu (2000) and Boraine's (2000)   refusal to make a distinction between good and bad violence, designating   violence in itself an object of repudiation. Finally, I will discuss what I   consider to be the principal political limitations and achievements of the   institutional experience on which a good part of the country's political efforts   during transition was concentrated.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The South African Truth and   Reconciliation Commission: Foundation and Structure</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the period of political transition in   South Africa, the rigid and impersonal nature of the state bureaucratic   apparatus appeared impotent to deal with the kinds of social demands directed   at it. For Alex Boraine, it was necessary to go beyond the boundaries of formal   politics and to institute a public dimension of dialogue and recognition (Boraine,   2000). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of   South Africa would serve this purpose. Inspired by models already tested in   Latin America, as well as in Eastern Europe, the TRC was the primary   institutional expression of South Africa's transitional paradigm. In the TRC,   there was space for mourning and emotion. Through the voluntary testimonies of   victims, witnesses and self-confessed aggressors, members of the Commission sought   to make progress in the public revelation of the methods and the everyday life   of oppression in the segregationist regime. In its testimonial process, the   objective of rehabilitating victims overrode the principle of efficiently   attributing guilt. According to its founders, attention was directed less at   scrutinizing the past than it was on the possibilities of reinventing   sociability in a context of profound social antagonism. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The TRC was created by the Promotion of National   Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 and it began its work in April 1996.   Presided over by Desmond Tutu, the archbishop of the Anglican Church, the   commission was given the responsibility of examining politically-motivated human   rights abuses, committed between 21<sup>st </sup>March 1960, the day of the   Shaperville massacre<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a>,   and the 10<sup>th</sup> May 1994, the first day of Mandela's term as President   of the Republic. The Commission was, above all, the political initiative of the   African National Congress. Despite its specific political origins, it reached a   diverse composition by having mobilized diverse actors across the political   spectrum and across national religions, such as the military and left wing   activists, Christians, Muslims and Hindus. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was in operation for two and a half   years, a period established in its founding document, with a six-month   extension conceded by parliament. As Boraine observed, the premise of its founders   was that the investigation of crimes should not go on for an excessive amount   of time at the risk of allowing past experience to condemn the present and   future of politics (Boraine, 2000). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Established with four regional offices &#150;   Cape Town, Gauteng, Durban and East London &#150; the TRC contracted 438 employees   and 17 commissioners in big and small cities across the entire country (Boraine,   2000). With regard to the structure, it included three committees that were dedicated,   in principle, to distinct yet complementary functions: the testimonies of   victims and witnesses, recommendations for reparation, and regulated concessions   of amnesty to self-confessed rights violators. The next section will deal with   each one of these in turn. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">i. The <b>Human Rights Violations Committee</b>,   hosted sessions of individual and institutional hearings. Institutional hearings   included the testimonies of representatives of civil and state organizations   such as police and military officials, religious leaders, lawyers and   businesspeople. The premise was that the history of segregation, along with   individual narratives of victimization, should also take into consideration the   narratives of people who acted due to compulsion, guidance and/or voluntary   identification with groups supporting or resisting the regime. The objective   was to make clear the links between institutions which committed human rights   violations during the apartheid years. In this way, the committee sought to ensure   a formal space for the process of collectively holding the influential groups   of the former regime responsible; whether they were linked to the state or not,   and regardless of their degree of formalization and dedication to the political   cause. The institutional hearings were not, however, the primary function of   this committee. Its public face was tied, above all, to the testimonies of   witnesses and victims of past violence and their specific tragedies. Around   twenty-three thousand of them were heard, with more than two thousand held in   public hearings, which included translations into the country's eleven official   languages and live transmission on national radio and television networks. The committee's   sessions reached a significant audience and were even transmitted on television   channels abroad. For Hugh Corder<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a>,   an expert in restorative justice at the University of Cape Town, the mobilization   of broad segments of the population around the Commission's work, was a radical   novelty as it enabled traditionally marginalized actors in the national   political scene, and those openly excluded from it, to be heard. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although linked to a secular state, the Commission   adopted a language and practices that were openly religious. The sessions of   the victims' committee were punctuated with prayers, candle-lighting ceremonies,   religious hymns and readings from the Bible, the "most subversive instrument in   a context of injustice and oppression", in Desmond Tutu's view (Tutu, 2000: 31).   For Villa-Vicencio and Du Toit, the objective was to create an atmosphere favorable   to forgiveness that would benefit from the religiosity of South Africans (Villa-Vicencio   and Du Toit, 2006: 120). As the 1991 census revealed, more than 70% of the   population had active links with one of the Christian denominations, creating conditions   for the "extraordinary capacity of the people to forgive", according to Tutu   (Tutu, 2000: 31). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The expectation at the time was that the   cathartic ritual of testifying would lead to the abandonment of punitive   demands. One of the testimonies quoted by Tutu relates: </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I feel what...has brought my sight back, my     eyesight back, is to come here and tell the story. I feel what has been making     me sick all the time is the fact that I couldn't tell my story. But now... it     feels like I have got my sight back by coming here and telling you the story     (Tutu, 2000: 167)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the committee's sessions, victims were to   feel part of a community of pain and to escape the solitude of trauma. In   Tutu's politico-religious rhetoric, beyond an openness to forgiveness, South   Africans would be particularly sensitive to the <i>ubuntu</i> spirit, a concept   of <i>bantu </i>origin to denote the sentiment that a person only achieves   self-realization through others. It is an identity constructed in opposition to   the Western principle of the self, self sufficient and removed from collective   needs. In this uniquely African consciousness with respect to the self, there   would be a possibility for a peaceful transition, inseparable from the   Christian motivation. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The religious perspective was therefore   predominant in the rhetoric justifying the Commission. Without apparent   tension, it accommodated, moreover, arguments inspired by psychoanalysis, well   formulated in the essay by Chris van der Merwe and Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela entitled <i>Narrating our Healing</i>. In this essay, the authors address three possible   reactions to trauma, an event which extinguishes the original meaning of life   and which sets up an insurmountable hiatus between past and present experience   (van der Merwe and Gobodo-Madikizela, 2008). For the authors, the first   reaction of the self shattered and disoriented by trauma is the annihilation of   the subject<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a>.   In this case, the authors argue that the sentiment of impotence could lead to   suicide. In the second reaction indicated, the subject, incapable of recovering   any sense of purpose in life, relives the trauma by inverting the places of the   agents in conflict &#150; that is, turning the self into the aggressor and the   original aggressor into the victim. The fiction of retribution tends to satisfy   the vindictive impulse and creates a sense of relief for the original victim.   For the individual and for society, the consequence of this path is a repetition   of the cycle of violence. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, the third possible reaction, which   is based on an incomplete and imprecise narrative of trauma, is precisely what   the founders of the Commission aimed to make possible in South Africa. This   consists of testimony as a therapeutic resource, capable of enabling freedom from   trauma and reconstituting the possibility of life. In this path, the interests   of the traumatized subject and the society that he/she is a part of would   coincide. Committed to the ideal of national reconciliation, the authors affirm   that, despite the essential (and even insurmountable) tension between trauma   and language, the very effort of communicating has a curative effect on the   self. The narrative which results from it, very possibly disordered and beneath   the emotional complexity of the event, is superior by definition to the   scenario of silence, in which there does not exist the possibility of a cure or   liberation, but rather the vicious reproduction of the cycle of violence. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In South Africa's transitional context, the   psychoanalytic perspective therefore patterns itself after the religious one,   around a method, a value, a counter-value and an objective, which are:   testimony, forgiveness, revenge and reconciliation. In this system, the purpose   of these testimonies is not simply to create a random collection of personal   tragedies, but rather to elucidate a common sense of suffering.&nbsp; The objective   was to reshape the pain of individuals as the pain of the nation, and thus to   create a singular national narrative, in spite of the division of its parts. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ii. The <b>Reparation Committee</b> had two   principal tasks. The first of them was to select deponents for the Human Rights   Violations Committee among volunteers who put themselves forward as candidates<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a>. Its second task was to   recommend to the government reparations to be granted to victim deponents, with   the objective of symbolically breaking with the organizational principles of   previous governments. One of the modalities of reparation was monetary. The   other assumed the form of public tributes to anti-apartheid figures with the   construction of monuments, parks and museums and the renaming of roads, schools   and other public spaces. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This committee was the focal point of a   significant part of the victims' dissatisfaction, both from those who had their   status recognized, and from those whose application to the victims' committee   had been denied. Both experienced a sense of re-victimization: those who could   not testify were hurt by the state once again and those who achieved   recognition as victims suffered with this principle and with the terms involved   with placing monetary value on their suffering. Firstly, they were disappointed   with the value recommended by the government committee: in reports published in   1998, this consisted of an approximate sum of three thousand dollars per year,   to be paid for six consecutive years. Next, they were surprised by the decision   made by President Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor, to give victim deponents a   one-off payment of about four hundred dollars. The low level of commitment   demonstrated by the Mbeki government with regard to the committee's   recommendations was made even more evident when he refused to tax companies   knowingly involved in sustaining the politics and the economy of apartheid<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a>. This negligence would   endanger two important objectives of the committee: holding responsible sectors   of civil society which collaborated in the political reproduction of an   oppressive regime, and the creation of a reparations fund for victims, especially   bearing in mind the lack of available funds for this purpose. By arguing that a   compulsory charge would threaten the principle of reconciliation, Mbeki made   voluntary the contribution of companies and individuals that had benefited from   the regime.&nbsp; </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A strong and general sentiment of disappointment   was therefore directed at the commission and the government. The contrast with   how readily the amnesty committee (described next) conceded amnesties created   the feeling that self-confessed aggressors were being privileged, to the   detriment of victims. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">iii. The <b>Amnesty Committee</b> was an   important mark of distinction in the Commission in relation to similar   experiences in the world. Dedicated to the reports of self-confessed   ex-aggressors who pleaded for civil and criminal amnesty, it initiated its activities   six months after the establishment of the Commission. To receive this benefit,   which was conceded on an individual basis, the solicitant had to fulfill three   requirements: provide proof of the political motivation behind their act, tell   the "complete truth" about the crime reported (which could imply denouncing   criminal networks associated with it) and prove that their actions had been   proportional to their stated objective. If solicitants failed to comply with   any of these demands, they would become subject to traditional judicial   procedures as with aggressors who did not volunteer themselves to the committee   and who could have their names implicated by other deponents. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The amnesty committee had statutes and   procedures that were very different when compared to the other committees, which   were rigidly inscribed within the limits of the Commission<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a>. Firstly, it had a   hybrid composition: among its five members, just two, with degrees in law, were   a part of the body of commissioners. The other three were judges directly appointed   by Mandela as a guarantee of political neutrality (Boraine, 2000: 116). Secondly,   its mandate permitted that plaintiffs could appeal to lawyers to speak in their   name. And finally, it was absolutely sovereign in relation to its decisions,   without the need to be subjected to the other committees. It functioned,   therefore, as an autonomous cell in relation to the wider body of the   commission. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With quasi-judicial procedures, the   committee distanced itself from the Commission's emotional style.&nbsp; In the   committee, there was no need for a public demonstration of remorse and pleas   for forgiveness. The necessary exchange was between truth and amnesty. According   to Hugh Corder, </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the     transition years, security forces destroyed much of the incriminating evidence     against the apartheid-era aggressors. Because of this, it was very difficult to     locate witnesses and gather evidence to press criminal charges against those     who did not volunteer to testify at the TRC. (Corder,     2008, verbal information). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the recourse to amnesty, there was   therefore a hope to generate revelations that would have been less likely to emerge   in regular judicial procedures, especially in a context where material proof   was scarce. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In practice, however, as Nahla Nvali (n.d.) reveals,   this objective was in great measure a disappointment. The majority of requests   for amnesty, around seven thousand in the whole country, saw ordinary prisoners   representing their crimes as political ones, with the intention of being freed.   They had nothing to lose. In the remaining cases, the accounts of political   crimes were not as revealing as they were intended to be.&nbsp; The deponents tended   to blame, in a diffuse manner, the state violence of the period, implicating   people who had already died and exempting themselves from providing a   comprehensive account of their participation. As it became clear that the   government was incapable of investigating the cases of solicitants who did not   follow procedures according to committee guidelines, there was less and less incentive   to collaborate with the committee. Few amnesty requests complied with the   conditions of the agreement and less than 17% of the total number of   solicitants received the benefit (Nvali, n.d.). Finally, the information which   resulted from this experience was insufficient to expose the reality of state   violence during apartheid. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The controversy surrounding amnesty   mobilized large segments of South African civil society. The families of Steve   Biko and other icons of the anti-apartheid struggle, associated with a wide   network of NGOs, attempted to create judicial obstacles to the committee's   prerogative to arbitrate civil and criminal forgiveness to self-confessed   aggressors (Boraine, 2000: 117). They alleged that the amnesty agreement hurt   their constitutional rights, and thwarted civil and criminal justice. The   Constitutional Tribunal nevertheless understood that the exception was   justified by the need to guarantee the general objectives of the transition and   also by the fact that the law which created the TRC envisioned the right to   reparation in place of the right to justice. The judicial decision was therefore   aligned with an understanding of amnesty as a condition for a new political   era. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">According to Boraine, the judicial threat to   the committee, which called into question the key recourse to amnesty,   ultimately benefited the Commission because it gave judicial powers the   opportunity to corroborate the political decision, which was at the heart of   the transition process negotiated in the country (Boraine, 2000: 119). For Hugh   Corder (2008), this convergence of powers was crucial for the maintenance of   political peace in the country. As the Constitutional Court was the highest   judicial court in the country, its decision meant that questioning the   constitutionality of the amnesty committee was no longer possible, allowing it   to continue its work without the threat of being shut down.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Military   Critique</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paradigm of forgiveness provoked the criticism   of actors situated on antagonistic points of the political spectrum. For Deon   Mortimer<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a>,   spokesperson of the now defunct South African Defence Force (SADF), in the institutional   sessions of the TCR victims' committee, the notion of forgiveness presupposed   an illegitimate attribution of guilt to the military.&nbsp; In his view, the actors   of the new political regime, under the guise of religious generosity, would   take an arbitrary and unjust judgment of the police and the military to be true.   The commission's search for the truth would be rhetorical and sensationalist.   For Mortimer (2008), "members of the commission wanted evidence that would   prove their point of view that the old regime was the devil". To this end, inquisitory   methods had been used in a manner that would guarantee that the final version   of the facts coincided with the Commission's <i>a priori</i> narratives about   the national reality. This forum did not have a genuine interest in the facts.   In the words of Mortimer: </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They demanded to     hear from SADF only what they thought would guarantee the condemnation of the     military. They wanted us to say, "we killed people". They did not believe in the     truth. They wanted us to tell them all the bad things we had done. In our     opinion, we hadn't done anything wrong. The members of the SADF had no reason     to take part in the Commission. Nothing that we did was illegal. (Mortimer, 2008, verbal information). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deon Fourier<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a>, retired general of the   South African voluntary army<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a>,   presented a different version, referring to the non-collaboration of members of   the defunct SADF with the TRC. According to him, lawyers for the military had instructed   their clients not to testify in the Commission, fearing accusations in   international tribunals which were independent of official decisions in   national territory. The public confession of guilt for crimes against humanity could   be used in cases that would escape the jurisdiction of the South African   government. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Contrary to this version of military   self-protection, Mortimer (2008) claimed that the "actions of the SADF were   legal. The excessive actions were residual. Few thought that it was necessary   to request amnesty. Very few". For him, what was at stake was the fundamental   misunderstanding between the military and the commissioners. In addition to being   against apartheid, members of the commission were, in general, incapable of   understanding the military point of view: "how can Tutu and Boraine, who are   pacifists, understand the soldier's point of view?" asked Mortimer. There was   no possibility for dialogue. "I too could never understand them", the retired general   concluded. In his perspective, the commission, without actually incorporating   the perspective of apartheid supporters, could not sincerely aspire to the   truth. For Mortimer (2008), in dispensing with one side of the story, the   narrative that the commission developed produced a biased version of collective   memory. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The general lamented, furthermore, the   non-recognition of military virtue in "freeing the country from the clutches of   the communists" and, moreover, in the process of a peaceful political   transition to democracy. In his words: </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indeed, we prevented an outbreak of chaos in     this country, from a legal and security perspective. We guaranteed peace and     the elections, which was not our function. Communism was defeated through our     efforts. We guaranteed that South Africa would not become a one party state. We     also helped Namibia and Zimbabwe. If the communists had seized power in Angola     and Zimbabwe, this would have extended towards us. We did a good job for this     country and for the region. When I am told that communism was not a threat, I     say "of course communism was a threat! Ask the Hungarians. How long did     they fight that bloody war? They were a subjugated country. The Soviet     government fell because it spent too much on defense, especially in Africa.     (Mortimer, 2008, verbal information). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Mortimer's (2008) testimony, the theme of   forgiveness appears to be essentially incompatible with the military   self-understanding of their place in history. His narrative however does not reflect   the entirety of the military perspective on the commission.&nbsp; Deon Fourier's (2008)   version about the pragmatic motivation among members of the defense force to   not participate illustrates this. Yet, it seems reasonable to suppose that   Mortimer's testimony is representative of a key sector of his class,   considering that the general was elected to speak in the name of the military   in the Commission's institutional sessions. The limited availability of   military officials to discuss the theme of repression made it difficult to   ascertain the levels of agreement and disagreement with other versions from the   military on the same topic.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The TRC and the Human Rights Activists'   Critique</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Forgiveness as a metaphor of political   transition also provoked, for radically different reasons, the reactions of   human rights activists, linked to a wide network of non-governmental   organizations which emerged in South Africa's post-apartheid.&nbsp; Hugo van der   Merwe <a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><sup>12</sup></a>,   director of the Transitional Justice Programme of the Centre for the Study of   Violence and Recognition in South Africa<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><sup>13</sup></a>,   agrees with Tutu (2000) and Boraine (2000) on the theory that religion had   inspired people "to be more understanding with their aggressors and to have   more tolerance and compassion", but highlights the high cost for people who   were not "ready to forgive". For him, "openness to forgiveness was not   unconditional". Many deponents would have been compelled to publically declare   forgiveness, due to the perceived and unspoken moral obligation to do so. In   the environment of testimony, van der Merwe (2008) suggests, all demands for   retribution were dealt with as inopportune individualism, incompatible with the   principle of reconciliation. This philosophy would have created unfulfilled   expectations of punishment and would have driven away potential deponents: one   notable group of people directly violated by the former regime had decided not   to seek recognition as victims by the Commission. For them the participation in   the processes of the Commission would not bring benefits in proportion to the   level of sacrifice implicated by testifying.&nbsp; </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Oupa Makhalemele<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><sup>14</sup></a>, also from the Centre   for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation in South Africa, highlights this   criticism: "the assumption that people who lived through years of conflict   would be able to reconcile was extremely optimistic. The emphasis on   reconciliation was excessive. This can not happen instantaneously". For him,   the paradigm of reconciliation clashed with the principles of "taking   responsibility" and "justice as accountability". The notion of <i>ubuntu</i> that "has to do with a certain myth about African culture, taken as an   indistinctive whole", would be "used in a undifferentiated way"<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><sup>15</sup></a>. The refusal to apply of   the punitive principle would be the result of a romantic and undifferentiated   view of African culture, which valorizes expressions of social harmony instead   of conflict. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Richard Wilson (2001), author of the <i>Politics   of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa</i> reiterates this critique of <i>ubuntu </i>as an unfortunate political category. For him, the idealization of an   African soul inclined towards forgiveness and to common life would had been   convenient for the rhetoric of amnesty, but inadequate for the redefinition of political   life on new terms. Based on the pan-Africanist fiction of reconciliation, the   Commission neglected the punitive principle of international treaties on human   rights in favor of a heterodox understanding of this topic, which envisioned   tolerance towards torturers and murderers as a precondition of democracy. According   to Wilson, in Desmond Tutu's unrealistic narrative, the vague allusion to an African   jurisprudence was based on the assumption that the expectations of justice were   of a restorative, rather than a retributive nature (Wilson, 2001: 152). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Wilson (2001), <i>ubuntu </i>corresponds   to a static and ahistorical image of African nations. The government discourse,   which purported to be sensitive to popular values, established a fictitious and   irreconcilable duality between, on the one hand, a conciliatory African soul   and, on the other, a vengeful Western disposition. In this perspective, all   punitive action would be antithetic to reconciliation. There was no possibility   of combining the two principles. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a study of South African townships,   Wilson devotes his argument precisely to <i>ubuntu'</i>s lack of importance, in   the face of the very real prevalence of demands for punishment in poor   communities in the country. In popular South African tribunals, even death was   given as a sentence for offenders. In these improvised spaces of justice, the   expectation of conciliation between offenders and victims was secondary in the   face of demands for retribution. In many cases, according to Wilson, the   punishment of aggressors was taken as a prerequisite for restoring the dignity   of victims. In this context, the political principle of amnesty seemed to run   counter to the priorities of social expectations (Wilson, 2001: 170). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among human rights activists, the criticism of   the forgiveness-reconciliation-amnesty formula amounted to a widespread   dissatisfaction with the Commission's negligence of the racial question, which   was the foundation of social distinction in the former regime. The organization's   mandate did not identify the political motivation behind racial crimes and   excluded it from the scope of investigation. For Madeleine Fullard<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><sup>16</sup></a>, ex-member of the   reparation committee of the TCR and director of the Missing Persons Task Team<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><sup>17</sup></a>:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The TRC ignored the     issue of race and discrimination, which took an economic and social form. Race     was an ugly word. Five million people were forcibly removed from their homes     because they were black. These people had limited mobility and we failed to     address that. (Fullard, 2008, verbal information). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the same vein, van der Merwe (2008) reaffirms   the misalignment of the Commission in relation to the specific South African   social and political context: "the theme of reconciliation should not be   between victims and torturers. The question is racial; it is beyond individual   agents". Reconciliation on an individual basis would tend to obfuscate the   force of the collective question which underlay the overwhelming majority of   cases taken to the commission: racism. In a complementary perspective, Deborah   Posel and Graeme Simpson draw attention to the commission's negligence of   violence against women. To omit this in the face of marked patterns of rights'   violations, the commission would have ignored "structural violence, based on race   and gender" (Posel and Simpson, 2002: 63). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In spite of having different goals, the   criticisms of the Commission were all directed against a common fundamental   characteristic: the individualist paradigm. In this perspective, the moral emphasis   on the idea of peace had led to a depoliticization of the Commission's   procedures, the result of which was a strict consideration of individual cases removed   from their social and political foundations.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The African National Congress and the   Dispute over Moral Equivalence</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to the disagreement about the   legitimate interpretation of human rights (disputed in large part by   commissioners and human rights activists), another, more basic, level of   disagreement divided those in charge of the political transition. This had to   do with the adoption of human rights as a political category and as a paradigm   of transition. In the post-cold war political scene, the notion of inviolable   universal rights collided with the radical language of the anti-apartheid   movement and led to open protests based on misunderstandings and frustrations in   the first years of South African democracy. The abandonment of a socialist   vocabulary in favor of the language of human rights, more palatable for the   transition period's white elite and attuned with the expectations of the   international community, constituted an important rupture with the kinds of   political expectations developed over the long and heterogeneous transition   towards democracy in the country.&nbsp; </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In spite of originally agreeing with the   commission's principles of action, party members of the African National   Congress (ANC) demonstrated dissatisfaction with the universalist paradigm of   the Commission and with the supposed "moral equivalence" of activists who resisted   the regime and those who were part of it. For Kader Asmal, one of the most   important representatives of the ANC in the process of managing the commission,   the "decriminalization of resistance" was an imperative of the new democratic   era. (Asmal, Asmal and Roberts, 1997). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the activist perspective, the struggle outside   of the legal framework of the former regime was absolutely necessary:   revolutionary activities were justified in the context of the former regime's   illegitimacy. In an interview for this research, Asmal (2008) affirms that   there were no doubts with regard to the judgment of political actors of that   era: the moral quality of men who dedicated their lives to surmounting the   "immoral, unjust and intolerable" order was superior to those who were in   charge of maintaining it. Asmal (2008) did not contest the reconciliation   paradigm, but vigorously opposed the premise of moral equivalence between past opponents.   For him, it was possible to reconcile without neglecting evidence of moral   asymmetry. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Tutu (2000) and Boraine's (2000)   political formula, the universalism of human rights and of religion combined to   form a discourse of peace and aversion to conflict. For them, it was not   reasonable to suppose moral distinctions among criminals: the violence of the resistance   movements should be an object of investigation and accountability in the same manner   as that of state agents. In this perspective, the just cause of freedom could   not welcome unjust procedures; the attainment of revolutionary ends could not   be different to its means (Tutu, 2000: 108). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Alex Boraine's terms, the objective of   the TRC was to "hold up a mirror to reflect the complete picture" of violence   in South African society. From that, it would be possible to identify "all victims   in the conflict and to confront all perpetrators of gross human rights   violations" (Boraine, 2000: 326). It would therefore not be suitable for the   Commission to decide about good and bad violence. The moral decision shifted   from the ends to the very means of political action, that is, violence in   itself. For Boraine, the moral choice for one side of the conflict would simply   prolong the authoritarian paradigm which they wanted to refute. The novelty of   democracy would consist precisely in the collective refusal of using violence   as a political instrument. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Tutu's narrative, this premise is   associated with the skill demonstrated in relativizing the categories of victim   and aggressor. For him, South Africa was a nation of victims and survivors,   affected by the common misfortune of apartheid (Tutu, 2000: 102). Among the   25,000 violent homicides committed during the regime, it is estimated that   16,000 had been the result of conflicts between rival segments in the political   struggle (Fullard, 2008). Many individuals therefore oscillated between the   status of aggressor and victim. The identities constituted themselves in an   ambiguous manner, incomprehensible through rigid moral categories. Not   unusually, and moved by the desire for retribution, the original victims   mimicked their aggressors and made themselves executioners, as seen in the van   de Merwe and Godobo-Madizikela's (2008) description   of the possible psychological processes that the traumatized subject   experiences. Paul Verryn, implicated in the Winnie Mandela scandal, summarizes   this scenario: </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The primary cancer was and will always be     the oppression of apartheid, but the secondary infection touched many of     apartheid's opponents and eroded their knowledge of good and evil. One of the     tragedies of life is that it is possible to become like those who we hate most     and I have a feeling that this drama is an example of that (<i>apud</i> Boraine,     2000: 222)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addressing the question of identities constructed   in a context of violent sociability, Alex Boraine (2000) identifies P.W. Botha,   the last president of the regime, and Winnie Mandela, ex-wife of Mandela and   anti-apartheid activist, as personalities that symbolized the "madness of   apartheid". On opposite ends of the political spectrum &#150; with differences in   origin, ideology, gender, age and the experience of power &#150; both had been   victims of the "South African tragedy", even as they were also &#150; knowingly &#150; agents   of violence. In this perspective, suffering has a singular and shared nature: treating   others inhumanely results in the dehumanization of the self. The role of agency   does not therefore extinguish the experience of pain. To illustrate this idea,   Tutu brings up the testimony of a confessed torturer, who committed suicide   after testifying in the amnesty committee: </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They can give me amnesty a thousand times.     Even if God and everyone else forgives me a thousand times &#150; I have to live     with this hell. The problem is in my head, my conscience. There's only one way     to be free of it. Blow my own brains out. Because that's where my hell is     (Tutu, 2000: 53-54)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Tutu (2000), the human soul does not   have <i>a priori</i> substance. Intrinsically good or bad people do not exist: we   all have the potential to act in every way, depending on the environment that   surrounds us. Goodness and evil therefore acquire an unexpected dimension of   chance and opportunity. Tutu asserts that "none of us could predict that if we   had been subjected to the same influences, the same conditioning, we should not   have turned out like these perpetrators"<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><sup>18</sup></a>.   In his view, "we cannot underestimate the power of circumstantial   conditioning". Men who "trod on the right path" should rehabilitate the "sons   of God who act as animals" and awaken them to the dormant potential of goodness   (Tutu, 2000: 85). Moral condemnation, on its own, does not take into   consideration the difficulties of the aggressor. In this perspective, evil is   described as an absence of good; it does not exist in and of itself. And, once triggered,   it is not an inexorable path. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Boraine, the tacit expectation among   members of the new democratic party was that, going against its neutral   mandate, the Commission would condemn the National Party<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><sup>19</sup></a>and its allies for   their dehumanizing policies and would make the ANC emerge as the "hero that had   stopped the villain in its tracks and ushered in a new democracy with a human   face" (Boraine, 2000: 326). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The disagreement between commissioners and   members of the ANC reached its peak in October 1998, the date of the   Commission's closure. At the beginning of that year, the ANC had asked for a   hearing with the TRC. Boraine and Tutu thought that an exclusive hearing for   the party would constitute an unjustified privilege and given the impossibility   of extending this recourse to other organizations included in the report, they   decided to refuse the request. As a reaction to this, the ANC, through a   judicial appeal, tried to impede the publication of the Commission's final   report. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The appeal was denied and the report was published   on schedule. In spite of this, the episode left deep scars in the memory about   the commission. Mandela declared public support for it but protested   disapprovingly in seeing that its report was guilty of "an artificial   even-handedness that seemed to place those fighting a just war alongside those   whom they opposed and who defended an inhuman system" (Boraine, 2000: 319).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Concluding Notes</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The context of democratic transition   coexists with a great sense of uncertainty over the political future ahead. In   addition to the lack of clarity over the new terms of public life, and the   establishment of new everyday routines, there is controversy and little clarity   with respect to the way in which cases of violence, which took place under repressive   regimes, will be dealt with. Will criminals &#150; self-confessed or not &#150; be held   accountable for their actions? In what manner? Will judgments on them take into   consideration new or old laws? </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The question of how to seek justice for past   crimes is central to new democracies. Generally speaking, this goal can be pursued   through three strategies, which are neither clear-cut, nor entirely mutually   exclusive, and which can thus substantially overlap. The first of them is retributive   in nature, tied to the objective of retaliating against past aggressors and in line   with a perspective that sees retribution for suffering as necessary.   International war tribunals are the key examples of this strategy. The second   strategy, in stark contrast with the first, dispenses with a punitive logic and   bases itself instead on a broad and unrestrained principle of amnesty. This   model is based on the assumption that the institutional framework of democracy,   in itself, establishes sufficient conditions for a new social pact. The   underlying presumption is that it is possible to erase the past, creating a new   blank slate on which a new society can be founded. This was the case, for   example, in the first decades of political transition in Brazil.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, in the third strategy, we return to   South Africa, whose experience of transition is situated somewhere between the   harsh principle of retribution and "blanket amnesty". For the architects of the   South African transition, regulated amnesty should serve the objective of shedding   light on the conditions and agents of past violence. The punishment of   aggressors is de-emphasized in order to establish favorable conditions for the   emergence of a new political scene. In the presumed moral context, victims would   receive the truth imbued in a spirit of forgiveness. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this article, I presented the TRC as the   primary institutional mechanism envisioned for the delicate exercise of redefining   social relations inherited from apartheid in South Africa. Its founders declared   grandiose political intentions &#150; further elevated by religious inspiration &#150; to   the detriment of localized, more palpable objectives. Thus, there was a marked   disparity between the ambitious mandate and the political discourse about the   commission, and its actual achievements. One of the important criticisms of the   Commission emerged precisely because of the disjuncture between the objectives   of national truth and reconciliation, on the one hand, and the practices and   actual results of the experience, on the other, namely the induced routines of   forgiveness, the minimal reparations paid to deponent victims and the   unsatisfactory levels of clarification about past crimes and of holding   accountable individuals and groups knowingly involved in human rights   violations. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In fact, the disparity between expectations   about the Commission and the actual results it achieved is salient. In part,   this contrast is the effect of the paradox of success. If it is reasonable to   suppose that one's capacity to reveal and make public the atrocities of   the former regime through the words of victims, is indicative of success, it   was precisely this event that instigated and encouraged the rejection of   amnesty as an appropriate recourse for dealing with those responsible for the   violence. This means that the knowledge of the truth about the victims advanced   in inverse proportion to the stimulus of reconciliation on the terms of the   Commission, that is, the terms of forgiveness. The Commission shifted trauma   and pain from private circles (of family, of friends and neighbors) to the   public agenda. In doing so, it created expectations it could not fulfill about   its capacity to produce closure with regard to this question that the   Commission itself had brought up and instigated.&nbsp; </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If it, in part, circumvented the boundaries   of the tribunals' actions &#150; and was praised for this &#150; it also created its own   set of frustrations. In South Africa, the Commission gave rise to a sense of   discontent which is inherent in political transitions &#150; for despite the   ruptures which they institute, they do not restore the period prior to the   violence and they coexist with sentiments of injustice and social rivalry. In   the Commission, there was a convergence of expectations which did not strictly   fit within its confines. Thus, to a large extent, the frustration that emerged   in relation to it was relevant to the wider political context, both past and   present. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Its capacity to shed light on crimes, for   example, was limited by the scarcity of material proof, a result of the   long-standing negligence of the former regime. It had to do with restrictions   that were beyond the reach of the Commission, but whose effects were projected   on it. With regard to the political obstacles of the new democracy, it is worth   underlining the low level of commitment to the objective of reparation demonstrated   by the Mbeki government and its dismissal of the Commission's recommendations.   The government's actions generated a feeling of injustice and disproportion in   the treatment given to rights violators, who benefitted from the amnesty, and   victims who deserved minimum compensation after exposing their stories during painful   testimonial sessions. The actual competence of the Commission was therefore clearly   below its capacity to complete the stated objectives - ambitious even for a   government agenda. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the Commission is seen, nevertheless, as   a short-term institutional experience, without having the expectation of   national redemption falling upon it, its achievements transcend its   shortcomings. When adjusted to the scale of this experience, the critique loses   much of its force. If, on the one hand, the case-by-case approach towards   brutal episodes by and against the regime neglected the question of everyday   racial violence against the black population, on the other hand, it established   a concrete and palpable dimension for the Commission's actions. Through the   means of testimony, it was capable of reconstituting the terms of the former   regime's political reproduction. In the place of an agglomeration of random   narratives, confined to the tragedies of their individual parts, the Commission   delineated the contours of the national tragedy, inapprehensible in its extent   and complexity. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, far from filling the gaps of   information about events and agents of past violence, the Commission, even so,   brought in sufficient elements to invalidate the denial or the allegations of   ignorance about apartheid. The agency of groups of society, which had until   then been forced into a situation of invisibility or political and social   marginality, established foundations for the new social memory of the country.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Interviews Conducted</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Andr&eacute; Du Toit, Emeritus Professor at the   University of Cape Town, specialist in transitional   justice.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deon Fourier, colonel of the former voluntary army of South   Africa.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Deon Mortimer, colonel representative of the South African   Defense Force in the human rights' violations committee of the Truth and   Reconciliation Commission. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fanie Du Toit, executive director of the   Institute for Justice and Reconciliation.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hugh Corder, Professor at the University of   Cape Town, specialist in restorative justice. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hugo van der Merwe, director of the   Transitional Justice Programme of the Centre for the Study of Violence and   Reconciliation in South Africa.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kader Asmal, deceased June 2011, was a key   personality in the anti-Apartheid struggle.

The latter obliged black South   Africans to carry with them a document authorizing them access to designated   areas in the country. This confrontation resulted in 69 deaths and injured   hundreds.<br />     <a href="#_ednref4" name="_edn4" title="">4</a>Interview of Hugh Corder with the author,   in Cape Town, 2008.<br />     <a href="#_ednref5" name="_edn5" title="">5</a> Important: van der Merwe and   Godobo-Madikizela do not imply a hierarchy of importance or incidence among the   three reactions indicated.<br />     <a href="#_ednref6" name="_edn6" title="">6</a> Candidates were people who claimed to be   victims or witnesses of serious rights violations during the period covered by   the Commission. The distinction between one and the other is tenuous or even   nonexistent, since witnessing violence is also a form of victimization.<br />     <a href="#_ednref7" name="_edn7" title="">7</a> With respect to the contribution of   private companies to the apartheid regime, Nvali cites the case of Swiss banks   who pulled the Botha government out of its financial crisis, deferring the   repayment of loans and buying more than half of the gold produced by the   country (Nvali, n.d.).<br />     <a href="#_ednref8" name="_edn8" title="">8</a> Deon Mortimer, representative of the   defunct South African Defense Force in the institutional hearings of the   victims' committee, referred to the Amnesty Committee as an organization   distinct from the TRC. He directed his harsh critique specifically against the   Commission, which he identified as synonymous with the Victims' Committee. With   regard to the Amnesty Committee, he referred to it, if not in a flattering   manner, neutrally. He said that they had done "their work".<br />     <a href="#_ednref9" name="_edn9" title="">9</a> Interview of Deon Mortimer to the author,   in Pretoria, 2008.<br />     <a href="#_ednref10" name="_edn10" title="">10</a> Interview of Deon Fourier to the author, in   Pretoria, 2008.<br />     <a href="#_ednref11" name="_edn11" title="">11</a> At the time of Apartheid, South Africa had   a voluntary army, with the same ranks and promotions as the regular army. Its   members had military education, and over the year, dedicated one month to   military activities, within and outside the country. Public and private   enterprises were under legal obligation to release their employees to this   purpose, without compromising the regular leave period to which they were   entitled. According to what I was told, participating in this military corps   was very common among white men.<br />     <a href="#_ednref12" name="_edn12" title="">12</a> Interview of Hugo Van Der Merwe, Hugo to the author, in August 2008.&nbsp; <br />     <a href="#_ednref13" name="_edn13" title="">13</a> An important South African   non-governmental organization formed in 1989, before the election of Nelson   Mandela.<br />     <a href="#_ednref14" name="_edn14" title="">14</a> Interview of Oupa Makhalemele to the   author in August 2008, in Cape Town.&nbsp; <br />     <a href="#_ednref15" name="_edn15" title="">15</a> For him, "there existed a disposition   towards forgiveness among the victims who participated in the TCR's process.   But this topic is a dangerous and controversial topic because it is necessary   to eliminate impunity". (Makhalemele, 2008, verbal information).<br />     <a href="#_ednref16" name="_edn16" title="">16</a> Interview of Madeleine Fullard in August 2008   to the author, in Pretoria.<br />     <a href="#_ednref17" name="_edn17" title="">17</a> The Missing Persons Task Team is linked to   The National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa. It was created after the   closure of the commission to give proceedings to the search of politicians who   disappeared during the Apartheid regime.<br />     <a href="#_ednref18" name="_edn18" title="">18</a> A tacit reference to soldiers and police   of lower rank, who were put under pressure to comply with orders. The   commission's procedure to attribute individual blame, to the detriment of   institutional responsibility, gave rise to, among other things, formal   opposition among members of the South African Police. According to Alex   Boraine, representatives of the military corps argued that "there should have   been collective responsibility for acts of violence". If the focus was to be on   the individual, this would privilege "political leaders who gave orders to the   police and who refused to acknowledge their responsibility" (Boraine, 2000:   126).<br />     <a href="#_ednref19" name="_edn19" title="">19</a> Founded in 1915, it was an apartheid party   which governed the country from June 1948 to May 1994.</font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

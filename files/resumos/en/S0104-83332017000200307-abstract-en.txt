Abstract Since 2002 international agencies have recognized refugee status on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. This article looks at the articulation between sexual rights and refugee rights and the emergence of the category &#8220;LGBTI refugees&#8221;. The relationships between gender, sexuality and violence are discussed in connection with the narratives about violence produced by various agents from the institutional world of refugees, and by asylum seekers themselves. The analisys is based on ethnographic field research in Spain and Brazil.

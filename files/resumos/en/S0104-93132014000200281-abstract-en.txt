The article analyzes the relationship between shamanic acts and myths among the Yuhupdeh people. This relationship is closely linked to the constitution of the person, since some ritual acts of shamanic curing appear as a key operation in the composition of the person. Through an examination of these acts, the analysis seeks to follow the continuous movement of the constitution of the person along the life cycle, as well as the multiplicity of this constitution, since, under the guise of a person, other persons and affects are concealed. As many ethnographic studies attest, the Amerindian person is not given as complete, but as a becoming.

The present article deals with hybrids emerging in the landscapes built by the inhabitants of the rural zone of SÃ£o Luiz do Paraitinga and a team of researchers studying the region, which I was part of. The appearance of these hybrids, considered to have taken place in a context of crisis, said so by several agents, and in landscapes where there is presumably a division of production and preservation sites, indicates a broad crisis of Modernity, in the sense of Latour that "we have never been modern".

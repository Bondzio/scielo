AbstractThis article presents the interweaving of body and diaspora as dimensions deemed relevant for the understanding of the African-Latin-American political actions, particularly in Brazil. Based on ethnographic data and discursive production between intellectuals and black movement leaders, I analyze the relation between body and power in the diverse dimensions of the anti-racist struggle carried out by black movement political actions. I focus on the displacement of representations, from the representation of the body as the locus of power to that of the body as the locus of resistance, as I emphasize on the diasporic dimension as the leading force of such displacement. I articulate Franz Fanon&#8217;s concept of colonial body and the black feminist critics in the race and gender intersectionality. Contributions for a political anthropology of the body are suggested, as African Latin-American diasporic perspective and experiences focusing on the body as a central dimension of the political dispute are seriously taken into account, with the aim of deracializing and pluralizing our societies.

The study describes the setting up of a database for the "Internal Bulletin of the Education, Assistance and Recreation Division - Boletim Interno da Divisão de Educação, Assistência e Recreio" of the São Paulo Municipal Secretariat for Education and Culture, a monthly publication that circulated among kindergartens in the city of São Paulo from 1947 to 1957. We justify the setting-up of the database because of the need to systematize the information on the structure and organization of the Internal Bulletin and identify educational trends and topics that were focused on. The guiding principle was that recording fields should not be defined, a priori, without prior examination of the publication. The database is deemed to be a first analytical process, which in order to provide information to the study, needs to be composed of analytical fields that are suitable to the specificities of the publication, going beyond the formality of records.

The changes in the work market and in the welfare systems imply a strong tension between the available resources and the existing household needs. Such inadequacy between resources and needs is compensated -in part - by an increase in unpaid housework. In this sense, this article aims to estimate the time assigned by a group of unemployed people aided by the State to housekeeping; describe which kind of basic activities this work requires; and analyze the dissimilar division of activities between men and women. In order to attain the expected objectives, a time use survey was carried out through a self-administrated diary technique.

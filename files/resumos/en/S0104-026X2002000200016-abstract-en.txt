This essay attempts at a brief chracterization of the "Movimento pela Humanização do Parto e do Nascimento" (Movement for the Humanization of Delivery and Birth) in Brazil. The Movement was established to promote changes in the assistance of delivery outside the realm of official health management organizations. Our discussion also debates the notions of Nature and Motherhood which are core concepts of the Movement as well the limits of the empowerment notion in this context.

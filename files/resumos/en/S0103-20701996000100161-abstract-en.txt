Because of the changes happening in labour a topology with new characteristics which can't easily be analysed is brought about. The gestures of the workers involved in the fulfillment of a task can't always be observed. In the same way bad working conditions aren't easily measurable or perceptible. The reality lived by the service employees is characterized by the absence of the materiality of labour's product. This article is an effort to contribute to the studies of service-labour by trying to "look at" this invisibility of gesture and of working conditions. By conceiving labour as a "making" it is possible to comprehend this operative gesture and look at the working conditions in connection with the operator's health.

Abstract A scenario of major inconsistency is reaching Brazilian educational levels. It is necessary to invest in educational infrastructure, teachers&#8217; careers, and the mechanisms of social control, while encouraging the participation of families and the community. It is, however, crucial to give centrality to the ethical, political and pedagogical aspects that are capable of favoring the freedom to teach and to learn, striving for an effective policy of transformation of the individual.

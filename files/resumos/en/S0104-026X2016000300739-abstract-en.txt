Abstract: In this work, it is observed the use of female body image as a repeated strategy in activist actions in different parts of the world. The aesthetic-political elements of the body, which have historically been used by the Arts, such as nudity, pain, eroticism and identity (or anonymity), are redirected to an active and participative culture project in the digital communication networks. The analysis is located in the biopolitics field and makes use of three recent examples: the Egyptian Aliaa Magda Elmahdy self-portraits and the actions of the collectives Pussy Riot (Russia) and Femen (Ukraine).

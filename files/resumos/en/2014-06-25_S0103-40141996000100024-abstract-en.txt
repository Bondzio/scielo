The revision of the Republic is a central concern in the works of Euclides da Cunha. It appears in his newspaper articles and in most of his books. He analysed the republican regime not only in Os sertões (Rebellion in the backlands, 1902), in which he deals with the Canudos War, but also in Contrastes e confrontos (1907) and in À margem da história (1909). He both witnessed and interpreted the trends of the new regime which he had helped to set up with his political articles in the newspaper A Província de S. Paulo.

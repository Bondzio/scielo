This study aims to analyze the economic impacts of the adoption of Bt11 corn in Brazil, as well as the consequences of the prohibition of the cultivation only in the Paraná state, if the state law number 14.162/03 would start to be active. For this purpose, an inter-regional general equilibrium computable model is used, gauged for 2001, simulating the reduction of insecticide, labor force, fuel and lubricants, as well as the increase in the yield observed in crops which use Bt11 corn. When the adoption of Bt11 corn in "technified" Brazilian regions is analyzed, the stock of capital and labor force moves from all regions to the South of the country. Taking into account that only Paraná state does not adopt the Bt11 corn, it is observed that both the labor force and the stock of capital move from the South and the Southeast to the Central-Western region of Brazil. The most expressive result takes place in the Paraná State, where not only the corn sector, but also downstream sectors lose competitiveness, reducing the level of activity, employment and household consumption. In general terms, the effects of the adoption of the Bt11 corn are transferred along its supply chain, increasing GDP, exports and household consumption. Results are more expressive in sectors and regions directly related to the corn supply chain, such as animal raising and meat, mostly located in the South of the country.

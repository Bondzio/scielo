<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This paper explores how caretakers of slave-era    heritage sites objectify and enact what Robert Bellah and his co-authors call    "communities of memory" in a racially polarized United States and    how the public interpret their efforts at creating what amounts to official    history. It highlights the often-vexed encounter between those who are in charge    of conveying public representations of slavery and race in the antebellum era    in the United States and vernacular responses to such representations. It looks    at Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, which recently has made great efforts    to make slaves prominent figures in the landscapes it reconstructs in on-site    maps, tours, and literature. Of particular interest are the various ways that    vernacular skepticism and cynicism about public portrayals continues to generate    controversy at Monticello, and particularly at how the topic of erasure and    invisibility remain enduring themes in the popular imagination of what public    history is all about when such history focuses on slavery and race. By interrogating    public skepticism about official portrayals of the past, the paper moves towards    a performative approach to studying what heritage does to identity production    rather than a representational approach.

Identity is a hard to pin down concept, used perhaps way too much,    defined, perhaps way too little, but generally deployed to refer to that sense    persons have that they belong – that, for example, they identify with    nation and with a nation's authorities. Heritage sites, as I am using the term,    include buildings, monuments and museums, not to mention all those scattered    pieces of inhabited or once-inhabited landscape which governments have set aside    – all those objects governments or private civic organizations have managed    to preserve and protect; all those traces of the past that typify the public    places of modern nation-states everywhere (Blatti, 1987; Evans; Boswell, 1999;    Karp; Kraemer; Lavine, 1992; Karp; Lavine, 1991; Sherman; Rogoff, 1994). Heritage    (or "the past") on display for edification and enjoyment is the quintessential    feature of modernity. By the same token, identity – having one, not having    one – is a quintessential problem of modernity. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both scholars who work at heritage sites and    those who study them as cultural phenomena assume that heritage does something    significant to the consciousnesses of those who visit such sites (Nanda, 2004;    White 1997; Yelvington, 2002). Critics of heritage sites argue that heritage    is a vehicle for the dissemination of "official history" that inculcates    a misplaced patriotism while erasing or eliding a more nuanced (and therefore    politically useful) understanding of the past. Celebrators of heritage sites    argue that nations need collective identities or shared social memories for    developing a better, more committed citizenry and that it is the job of the    state to provide them (Kammen, 1997). Heritage shapes national identity by creating    an "imagined community" (Anderson, 1991) or a "community of memory"    (Bellah et. al., 1985; Lowenthal, 1985). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As such, both those who celebrate and critique    such sites assume their significance. They stress their representational power.    But, if we study heritage sites and museums as places of performance rather    than as forms of representation, we might question both the sanguine and pessimistic    views of what these sites do. After all, imagined communities are created from    the bottom up, as the people who visit museums sometimes argue back at the messengers.    Moreover, museums in democratic nation-states actively pursue their publics    and occasionally cater to their desires because museums, like modern democracies,    are premised on the willing participation of a citizenry. As a result the history    they produce is a cacophonous outcome of contest and compromise; it is a product    of negotiations among the (at times deeply divided) professional historians    and the (often factionalized) public at large (Handler; Gable, 1997). Museums    may be in the business of producing official history, but as the museum also    tries to enact democracy, the history it makes is inherently messy (Kurin, 1997).    </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">History museum's caretakers have a peculiar relationship    with their public in this managed "regime of knowledge" (Bennet, 1995).    They are, as Tony Bennett argues, at once gatekeepers, judging a public's comportment,    and facilitators, encouraging a public's participation. Members of a public    whose understanding of "the past" diverges too widely from the caretakers'    own understanding might be dismissed on grounds of comportment because in the    context of the creation of a managed community of memory these dissenters count    as a kind of rabble. But caretakers might also feel compelled to conform to    their public's rearranging of the past even when the public's understanding    seems at odds with authoritative knowledge (Gable, 1997). In the United States    and I would imagine elsewhere, because the people who manage history museums    feel that they must make a democracy as much as represent its collective past,    they are constantly monitoring their ongoing engagement with the public, testing,    for example, whether the site has a representative or suitably diverse following    or whether it seems to cater to one audience and not another (see Kurin, 1997).    Arguments about what counts as "true" or "false" history    reveal and even exacerbate troubling differences among communities of "experts"    and the public they ostensibly serve and educate. Yet, professional historians    and educated members of the public increasingly operate with a model of "history"    in which history is not the past but a reflection of present day concerns and    prejudices. It is also generally assumed that contradictory versions often co-exist    and reflect the concerns of different factions within the public institution    (see Handler; Gable, 1997). A museum or heritage site that a "significant"    segment of the public does not visit or a site that this public loudly criticizes    for using the cloak of authority to hide "the truth" can come to be    perceived by its caretakers as a failure and an embarrassment. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In recent years, at American slave-era heritage    sites, black Americans have acted as such a public, pressuring such sites' caretakers    to change the way slaves and slavery are incorporated into America's pedagogic    landscape (Horton; Crew, 1989). This is clearly the case at Monticello –    a plantation and the home of Thomas Jefferson, one of founding fathers of the    United States – as I came to know it from ethnographic observations of    what in cultural studies is called "performance," or more prosaically,    the ways visitors and the site's caretakers interact with one another, and from    listening to what they say about such encounters. My ethnographic account is,    however, truncated. I began observing Monticello when I went to work there as    a "Visitor Services Specialist" from March 1988 to November 1988.    I took notes of conversations I had with employees and visitors with an eye    toward an ethnography of this American shrine. In 1989 Richard Handler and I    wrote an article describing the dilemmas museums like Monticello and Colonial    Williamsburg face as they attempt to enact contradictory egalitarian values    in the ways they treat the visiting public. We also applied for funding to study    these two institutions in depth. After reading our proposal and our paper, the    leadership at Monticello decided that, because the museum was already "over-assessed,"    our study would not serve its interests, and therefore denied our request to    carry out research there. We went on to carry out fieldwork at Colonial Williamsburg    exclusively. Nevertheless, Dr. Jordan, the current Director of the Foundation,    agreed to be formally interviewed on two occasions in 1992. This essay combines    elements from those interviews along with what I learned while I worked at Monticello    and what I continued to learn in subsequent years from friends and acquaintances    among Monticello's employees with whom I have stayed in close contact. It also    includes what I have gathered from public sources. I should note that all quotes    from conversations are from written notes I took at the time or from transcriptions    of the tape-recorded conversations I had with Dr. Jordan. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I started observing Monticello in 1988,    I witnessed the beginnings of a major shift. The site's caretakers were compelled    not only to tell the celebratory story of Jefferson's life and achievements,    but also to represent slaves as historical actors in their own right; and they    began to quietly change what they were willing to entertain about Sally Hemings,    a mulatto slave who many Americans, and especially African-Americans, believed    had a long-standing liaison with Thomas Jefferson. In early 1988 staff on the    site were still treating this story as a myth not worthy of sustained discussion.    By 1998 discussion of the liaison is a major theme in the site's verbal, textual    and visual reconstruction of antebellum race relations. This ostensibly was    because of a DNA study publicized in that year that showed the genetic connection    between Jefferson and the descendents of Hemings (Foster; Tyler-Smith, 1998).    But that study would never have been done were it not for what happened a few    years before as African-Americans used the site to indict publicly the history    of Monticello as a sham. I will focus on how the site's caretakers either were    swayed by or dismissed public skepticism about the way the Foundation chose    to deal with the purported liaison between Jefferson and Hemings. By looking    at shifts in institutional policy on the liaison, I will illustrate the contested    nature of official history in modern democracies, the way such contests are    enacted in museum practice, and by extension what heritage does and does not    do. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>The site </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Monticello is one of dozens of slave-era plantation    houses which were bought in the first decades of the twentieth century by philanthropic    organizations for the edification and enjoyment of the public (Peterson, 1960;    West, 2001). But Monticello is a unique slave-era plantation because it was    the residence of Thomas Jefferson; and the motto of the Foundation that runs    the heritage site is to "preserve and maintain Monticello… as a national    shrine and to perpetuate the memory of Thomas Jefferson and those principles    for which he contended." "Those principles", guides at Monticello    will tell you, are embodied in the three things for which Jefferson wanted to    be remembered. He wrote Virginia's statute for religious freedom, he was the    founder of the University of Virginia – one of the first publicly funded    institutions of higher education whose core moral principles emerged out of    enlightenment humanism rather than an association with a Christian faith –    and, above all, he was the author of The Declaration of Independence. It is    from these three acts, and primarily for his authorship of the Declaration of    Independence, that the Foundation – and to some extent the public –    adduces "those principles for which he contended". What is stressed    is Jefferson's role as a founder of American political values – individual    freedom, equality of opportunity, the pursuit of happiness. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Foundation also stresses Jefferson's preoccupation    with intellectual and aesthetic pleasure – his love of gadgets, art, literature,    music, gardens, architecture, archeology, science, food. Indeed, the over half    a million visitors a year who take a twenty-five minute tour of the house and    spend perhaps an hour exploring the grounds are more likely to learn details    of Jefferson's aesthetic interests than of his political principles. While in    the house, they are treated to brief vignettes about mechanical wonders such    as the Great Clock whose weights, one for each day, disappear into a hole cut    into the floor. They are allowed a glimpse of the narrow stairways that lead    to the "invisible" upper floors and the mysterious dome or "sky"    room that none of the general public will ever see. But mainly there are books,    paintings, musical instruments, furniture, wallpaper; and outside, flowers from    around the world. Visitors receive a quintessential "house and garden"    tour – with Jefferson playing invisible host. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At Monticello, Jefferson's pursuit of knowledge    and aesthetic pleasures have been portrayed as both a sign of and a reward for    his success at living a life according to the civic virtues he authored. Yet,    because Thomas Jefferson was a slave-owner, this celebratory narrative has always    been potentially threatened. Jefferson's particular freedom to pursue happiness    for himself and his family could be linked to emiseration of others. Or Jefferson    could be dismissed as a hypocrite whose lofty words did not match his deeds.    Over the years I was familiar with Monticello, these criticisms occasionally    surfaced in encounters the site's staff had with scholars in the wider knowledge-producing    community. In these encounters historians and archaeologists suggested informally    and privately that Monticello consider reconstructing slave quarters on the    site to make it easier for visitors to experience Monticello as a "working    plantation". In the 1980s and 1990s the criticisms of Monticello and Jefferson    crystallized in the popular imagination, around an illicit sexual liaison Thomas    Jefferson allegedly had with a slave, Sally Hemings. That Jefferson denied having    a long affair with an enslaved woman and denied any substantive connection to    their several offspring could exemplify, at once, the typical hypocrisies of    the politically powerful, the particular duplicities and fundamental inequities    of race-based slavery, and – as "official history" continued    to dismiss these stories – a sign of an ongoing cover-up. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Interpreting a performance: defending Jefferson's    reputation </b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In 1988 when I began research at Monticello I    was intrigued by the Foundation's response to visitors' often pointed interrogation    of Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemings. I was interested in how the    ongoing act of representing a particular version of the past compelled a certain    comportment among the site's caretakers and visitors alike. My assumption was    that Monticello's ongoing conversation with its public would also entail teaching    and learning a particular etiquette. This etiquette emerged out of the place    museums typically occupy in modern democracies, the "exhibitionary complex",    as Tony Bennett so deftly characterizes it. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To tease out the significance of museums in modernity,    Bennett compares "the exhibitionary complex" (which includes art galleries,    expositions and department stores as well as museums) to Foucault's "carceral    archipelago" – the system of prisons, insane asylums and the like    – which also has its origins in modernity. Prisons, Foucault famously    argued, turned an opaque populace – thieves, murderers and other threats    to public peace, hidden in the poor sections of the city or in the forests beyond    the state's highways – into a visible and monitorable group. Museums,    Bennett argues, made another populace into a citizenry – people who learned    to look at the world through the eyes of power and as a result internalized    that way of looking. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not that the proprietors of increasingly open    museums trusted their citizenry to behave themselves. Bennett reminds us that    the rise of the modern museum arose from an ongoing conflict between reformers,    emphasizing that the crowd can be educated not to be unruly, and elitists, ever    fearful that the crowd will act like a mob, that they will touch and do damage    to, rather than look. Because of this ambivalence about their public, Bennett    notes, the democratizing museum inevitably fails to live up to an institution's    own internally generated goals. The wish to "reform" is driven by    two internally generated principles – "the first…sustaining    the demand that museums should be open and accessible to all… the second…    that museums should adequately represent the cultures and values of different    sections of the public." These institutional imperatives lead to "insatiable"    (that is never satisfied, but always crying out for satisfaction) demands for    reform and endless talk (often self-serving) that reforms are occurring, that    progress is, despite inevitable set-backs and obstacles, happening. Museums    are supposed to be universal. If they are about "man", they are about    all groups of human-beings. Groups who feel excluded can make claims –    based on the museum's own morally binding goals – for inclusion (Bennett,    1995, p. 90). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reforming museums claim, as Bennett puts it,    to address a "public made up of formal equals" but end up making distinctions.    The door is open, but not everyone seems willing to or proves capable of going    through. If museums are places where a public learns to look but not touch,    if they are sites where a public learns to become bourgeois, they are also places    where caretakers come to assume as inevitable specific ways of governing or    managing a public. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At Monticello I was particularly interested in    what in museum parlance are called frontline employees – guides and other    staff who convey the site's stories to the public. Guides, during the period    of my research, tended to be middle-aged women of a certain cultured quality    and education that would mark them as upper-middle class. There were also young    men and women – recent graduates of university history and literature    departments – barely scraping by on a meager guide's salary, and some    of the older women were divorcees or in otherwise straitened circumstances,    but they all maintained a cultured look and comportment. They were invariably    "courteous" but they looked down their noses at such places as Colonial    Williamsburg, where guides had to be artificially friendly to visitors and had    to dress in period costume and speak in period accents. At Monticello, they    dressed up rather than down. Their "uniform" was an idealized borrowing    from the style of the country gentlewoman or gentleman. And when they retired    from the public eye to have lunch together in the guides' kitchen, they ate    meals that required a fork and knife or spoon, not sloppy sandwiches and the    like. I found them congenial company. I wanted to ascertain how their encounters    with the public led them to incorporate a certain lived attitude toward "the    public". </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To hear them talk, hardly a day went by when    the site's guides were not asked by some visitor about "Sally Hemings",    Jefferson's "slave mistress" or Jefferson's "other" (meaning    unacknowledged) children. Often as not, the visitor would phrase the question    in an accusatory or mocking tone – the kind of tone I associate with reporters    at White-House press conferences when the event turns stonewalling into a kind    of theater. And indeed, the guides' general response – the response their    superiors encouraged them to make – sounded a lot like stonewalling. The    guides I observed or talked with discounted the story as a kind of "rumor"    by invoking the authority of "professional historians". </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">What they said emerged out of their appraisal    of what motivated the public to ask such questions. But it also reflected what    they had been taught. This is what they learned, for example, in the in-house    compilation of frequently asked questions written specifically for guides, under    the section, "What is the truth about Jefferson and the slave Sally Hemings?"    </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The allegation that Sally was Jefferson's mistress      and bore his children was first published by a vengeful journalist… in      1802. Fawn Brodie's biography of Jefferson and a novel by Barbara Chase-Riboud      have recently reiterated this claim &#91;(Brodie, 1974; Chase-Riboud, 1979)&#93;.      Although it is impossible to prove either side of the question, serious Jefferson      scholars are unanimous in discounting the truth of such a liaison. In the      opinion of Jefferson's biographer, Dumas Malone, it would have been totally      out of character and "virtually unthinkable in a man of Jefferson's moral      standards and habitual conduct". (Stanton, 1987, p. 20). </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The official position the guides were taught    was ostensibly non-committal – "impossible to prove either side of    the question". Yet this training document juxtaposes the authority of "serious    Jefferson scholars" with a "vengeful journalist", and a bestseller    "novel" with the authority of Jefferson's most famous biographer.    </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, it is not surprising that many of the guides    interpreted visitors' persistent preoccupation with this sexual liaison as graphic    evidence of the low appetite for scandal. As guides often put it, the public    "wants to knock alabaster statues off their pedestals". Or the guides    construed pestering queries as reflecting a barely concealed desire among the    public to besmirch the Monticello Foundation's reputation. Guides often complained    to me that aggressive if transparently sly questions such as "But what    about Jefferson's other children?" made it "impossible", to do    anything but react defensively. As one guide remarked, "a little while    ago a visitor asked a guide (who had just finished her tour), 'what did you    tell them about Thomas Jefferson screwing colored girls?' Now, how are you going    to answer a question like that?" – without, the guide didn't need    to add, becoming complicit in racial slurs or sexual crudities. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If an interest in discussing Sally Heming's sexual    liaison with Jefferson was a sign of poor manners that could occasionally be    dismissed as bigoted, some guides also believed that such questions also reflected    a general, if misplaced, obsession with secrecy. Visitors often talked as if    the upper floors of the house (especially the dome room), which are off limits    to the general public, were secret chambers that contained important artifacts    purposely kept hidden. People would get off the bus and want immediately to    be directed to the "hidden" passages that they assumed honeycombed    the house and grounds. These secret passageways and rooms were often associated    in the popular imagination with Sally Hemings. Guides complained that visitors    would occasionally pester them to show the "secret room" just above    Jefferson's bed where Sally Hemings had remained hidden and waiting to answer    his call. Some wanted the guides to show them the ingenious system of pulleys    which allowed Jefferson to hoist his bed up into this secret cubby hole. Others    asked to see the air tunnels they thought led to secret and distant locations    for the love tryst. Usually such requests were countered with a courteous, if    often icy, resort to a "just-the-facts" accounting. For example, those    underground air-tunnels, they would tell the visitor, were "in fact"    ingenious because they let fresh air circulate to privies situated close to    the house. One guide remarked: </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After one tour a woman came up to me and <I>demanded</I>      to know why we didn't mention anything about the secret passageway to Michie's      Tavern. I would like just once to wink or to give some sign…to pretend      just once that the secret does exist, that the Foundation is part of some      vast secret conspiracy to keep the truth from the people (but) because of      some flash of communion with this particular visitor I'm going to lift the      veil and reveal it all.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> As this guide saw it, visitors in pursuit of    the secret of Sally Hemings were asserting the existence of a body of knowledge    kept purposely out of the public domain. The guide also recognized that when    she and her colleagues routinely dismissed the Hemings story as "fiction",    or countered queries about the site's invisible passages and hidden chambers    with a dry "just-the facts" response, they simply confirmed this suspicion.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In sum, guides learned the implicit lesson that    in any democracy, no matter how open, there will always be a minority who believe    in "conspiracy theories". Monticello was the perfect terrain upon    which to enact such theories. Guides, who stood in an intermediary position    between the public and museum leadership, developed an exaggerated faith in    the truth of official knowledge as they found themselves compelled to act as    guardians of the reputation of an exemplary figure and of the institution itself.    </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>African Americans and Monticello </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">During the years that Monticello's guides were    incessantly pestered by white visitors about Sally Hemings, the Foundation's    leadership was trying to make the site more congenial to African Americans.    The site's caretakers were embarrassed that there were so few black visitors    to the mountaintop. The Foundation's director Daniel Jordan, the research historian    Lucia Stanton, and the site's archeologist William Kelso all argued that if    Monticello would focus more on the contributions of the hundreds of slaves who    shared the mountaintop with Jefferson, then more African Americans would visit.    In a 1992 interview, Jordan explained to me that for a long time "slavery    was the "'s' word" among the guides who preferred the less explicit    euphemism "servants". In the Foundation's early days, members of the    often implicitly segregationist "white identity" organizations –    the "Daughters of the American Revolution" and the "United Daughters    of the Confederacy" – served in rotation on Saturdays, Sundays and    legal holidays, while black doormen in livery continued to greet tourists at    the East Portico door. And gentility in whiteface continued to be a hallmark    of the site long after these organizations ceased to have an official presence    at Monticello. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To rectify the errors of the institution's past    and to make the site more congenial to African-Americans, Jordon and his staff    tried to represent slaves and slavery in the texts and images it produced. The    Foundation also made efforts to reach out to the African-American community    by inviting prominent African-Americans to speak at public events such as the    July 4th naturalization ceremony. Most significantly, in 1992, the museum hosted    a reunion of the Woodson family, whose members claimed to be descendants of    Tom Woodson, the putative first and purposely unrecorded child of Thomas Jefferson    and Sally Hemings. By looking at this event, we can see how Monticello, with    its status as a site for the production of public history, could become a location    for public contestation of that history, a contestation which is performed or    enacted. During the reunion the Woodsons would question the official version    of history to call attention to the generally disenfranchised status of African    Americans in the national imagined community. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Woodsons for their part insured that the    event would be televised by NBC national news. There, the reunion was portrayed    as an antagonistic encounter with the Hemings story resonating as a kind of    expos&eacute;. The Woodson family, so the announcer said, came to Monticello    "to claim what they say is their plantation". As such the Woodsons    echoed what the political activist Jesse Jackson had said about Monticello on    a visit that occurred shortly before the Woodsons made their appearance. Jackson    accused Monticello of "throwing sand on the fires of history" because    it failed to give credence to the love affair between Hemings and Jefferson    or mention the offspring they created together. To Jackson (and to many other    African American intellectuals), Monticello's squeamishness was symbolic of    the inability of white America to accept black America as a part of the same    over-arching national family. Like Jackson, the Woodsons asserted that Monticello    had not been forthcoming in addressing their claims. Exposing miscegenation    kept secret could be seen as central to telling a story of kinship denied. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Woodsons, in short, portrayed Monticello    as a typical white establishment villain. And every Monticello employee I talked    to after the event agreed that the Foundation had taken a public relations beating    on national television. Yet, Monticello did not expect the Woodsons to produce    (with NBC's collusion) the generally derogatory sound-bites that would be broadcast    to the nation. In an interview I had with Jordan several months before the event,    he talked about the Woodson reunion with considerable enthusiasm – "a    milestone in Monticello's dealing with this part of history". As he listed    all the things Monticello was doing to focus more on slave life he exclaimed:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I think a wonderful thing is going to happen      next spring. That is, we believe we're going to have a reunion here of the      descendants of some Monticello slaves… We participated in Black History      Week this year and (our research historian) gave a wonderful talk…to      a packed house…And she led them on a walk along Mulberry Row and explained      to them what took place when, and how much we do know about these people –      a lot. And this guy (who plans the Woodson reunion) was in the audience and      has become a friend. And he mentioned the possibility of a reunion and I said,      'Gosh that's a wonderful idea.' So he's coming next week, and we're having      lunch. And we're going to plan this homecoming and we're going to do everything      that we can to see that it happens… </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The homecoming Jordan envisaged was to have been    a quiet one. The Woodsons would get a private tour of Monticello, the kind of    tour the Foundation gives routinely to people they call "persons of stature"    – corporate and governmental VIPs, and the hundreds of Jefferson's legitimate    descendants who hold their annual reunion at the family cemetery on Jefferson's    birthday. The Woodsons would also be feted to a picnic lunch at the satellite    plantation of Shadwell. But the discreet attempt at inclusion became, when the    Woodsons invited the press, a public reenactment of exclusion. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Why then did the televised version of this event    become an antagonistic encounter rather than the "homecoming" of new    friends that Jordan portrayed himself anticipating in his interview with me?    Initially I thought that it was because the Foundation was not aware of the    Woodsons' genealogical claims. (Note that in the excerpt above the Woodsons    are characterized as "the descendants of some Monticello slaves").    But in an interview after the visit, Jordan insisted that he knew all along    about their putative ancestry. In that encounter I was impressed more than anything    by his befuddlement with the public's continued preoccupation with the Sally    Hemings story. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jordan remarked that "Jefferson", (like    the Foundation), "would never duck any tough questions like race. But,    on the other hand he's a man for the ages… and we don't want to be too    provincial in this stewardship."And in some sense his status as slaveholder    might count as a provincial issue, an issue that associated Monticello with    "the South", as compared to, for example, his authorship of the Declaration    of Independence, an achievement of global significance.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> But just as importantly, Jordan simply believed    that "serious scholars" were similarly dismissive of the issue. He    reminded me that the historian John Chester Miller, who had often been a critic    of Jefferson the slaveholder, and who had also privately criticized Monticello's    treatment of the topic of slavery (he had been a "friendly gadfly"    as one staff member put it to me) "wrote a whole chapter demolishing the    liaison". But he also noted that "Monticello sells more copies of    Fawn Brodie than any bookstore in America." Jordan was referring to the    bestselling work of "psychological history" that went a long way in    publicizing the liaison as "fact," and that the Foundation explicitly    dismissed as unsubstantiated guesswork. Jordan made this remark to emphasize    that Monticello was tolerant of a diversity of opinions. But he stressed that    Monticello did not modify the way it responded to the public's interest in the    Hemings story either in reaction to criticism or in response to consumer preference.    He said that if there were ever hard evidence of the liaison, then the Foundation    would tell the truth no matter how controversial, but "right now, we just    don't know". Nevertheless, in discussing the Woodson family's claims, he    wanted to be sure that I knew that, "I respect their oral tradition".    </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Where the truth lies </b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To respect an oral tradition while at the same    time maintaining a judicious "agnosticism" (as it is often described    by historians writing on the topic) on the issue of the liaison entailed a peculiar    construction of an official community of memory at the site. It privileged,    if inadvertently, a certain kind of "serious scholarship" as standing    for the final word as far as "professional knowledge" is concerned;    it allowed for contestation of that knowledge, but only as that knowledge is    subtly marked as different, "other", "oral" traditions passed    down through the generations as a kind of collective memory among "other"    people.<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><sup>1</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> New evidence of the officially recognized kind    was, however, eventually produced, in large measure because the Woodsons continued    to press their claim, provoking a collection of DNA from themselves, other Hemings    descendents, and descendents of Thomas Jefferson's "white" family.    When the journal <I>Nature</I> published an analysis the DNA evidence (along    with an editorial by the historian Joseph Ellis, who compared Thomas Jefferson's    sexual transgressions to President Clinton's with Monica Lewinsky) in November    1998, Dr. Jordon (who knew about the article in advance) immediately held a    news conference to accept the report as the truth. What Jordon did not address    in that news conference was the fate of the Woodson family's claim to a connection    to Jefferson, a claim which, ironically, was also ostensibly disproved by the    same DNA evidence that proved the Hemings–Jefferson liaison. In the months    following, the Woodsons would complain loudly to who ever listened that they    trusted the DNA evidence as little as they had once trusted those who had relegated    their memory to the status of rumor. As a result of their complaining, as much    as because of the DNA results, the Woodsons would also quickly lose their cachet    at Monticello. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I witnessed the last public occasion that the    Woodson descendents would be invited to the site. Scholars were presenting evaluations    of Monticello's role in remaking the American imagined community, in effecting,    as one of the panelists, the director of Monticello's guides, put it, "healing"    between blacks and whites. Now that Sally Hemings had taken her place alongside    Thomas Jefferson, black and white Americans could recognize that they were a    single "family". By accepting the truth of the DNA tests, Monticello    had become a locus of racial reconciliation. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then Byron Woodson spoke. His story was more    critical than celebratory. He argued that the DNA test had been "hijacked"    by Clinton supporters to "save his presidency" by comparing Clinton's    peccadilloes with Monica Lewinsky to Jefferson's liaison with Hemings. Byron    Woodson emphasized that this kind of hijacking of black history for white purposes    "has been going on for too long" and was still going on. Later, Byron    Woodson would publish a book, <I>A President in the Family: Thomas Jefferson,    Sally Hemings, and Thomas Woodson</I> (Woodson, 2001). In it he would make several    accusations of cover-up, and concluding with a critique of the duplicities of    official history: </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ultimately, however, the Hemings/Jefferson      controversy will not be resolved…with a bogus headline in Nature, not      in a press conference called by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation…      It will be resolved by a family – my family. (Woodson, 2001, p. 251).      </font></p> </blockquote>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Conclusion</b> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When scholars study history museums to see what    they do to the identities of publics that visit them they usually treat the    site as a collage of texts to be read as "representations" of the    ideology of official history. But we can also consider the museum as a kind    of theatre where guides and visitors alike perform. Such performances can be    interpreted for what they tell us about making citizens, about making publics    in democracies – about how identity as an act. In the first approach a    history museum produces the ideas about the past that an "imagined community"    holds (more or less) in common. In the second approach, the museum produces    a certain kind of comportment which can be resisted or contested. It is this    second methodological approach that I have employed here. What can we learn    from the two sets of performances I have sketched above – first, the day    to day encounters that occurred between guides and visitors, and second, a dramatic    event involving African American appropriations of the site? </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Above all, it is clear that official history    is being constantly questioned. When the members of the Woodson family stand    on Mulberry Row and complain to Monticello's chief research historian that their    tour has been a "glaring disappointment" because their ancestor, Tom    Woodson, was not mentioned along with Jefferson's other children, they are questioning    the official terrain at Monticello. When visitors ask the niggling question    about Sally Hemings, they, too, are subverting official history. Some of these,    doubtless, want their suspicions confirmed that in things American there is    always a conspiracy afoot. Others probably get a certain bigoted pleasure in    being able to assert in public that even the sanctimonious are "screwing    colored girls". Such questioning has a variety of effects, among them that    Monticello has been able to dismiss much public criticism as evidence of public    inferiority, a symptom of a more pervasive ignorance among the masses at large.    As such, the performative space of Monticello confirms a fairly standard (and    secretly cynical) attitude "experts" in democracies have about the    public in general. They are ignorant, so they need guidance. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But occasionally public criticism has to be taken    more seriously. If white visitors could be dismissed for believing in the liaison    between Sally Hemings and Jefferson, black visitors could not so easily be shrugged    off, precisely because their absence from the site was itself an indictment    of its democratic pretensions. Yet, such efforts can also be interpreted by    a cynical public (and cynical insiders as well) as no more than a public relations    ploy. After the news conference in which Dr. Jordon accepted the DNA evidence    a member of Monticello's staff would remark privately to me that the news allowed    for a public relations windfall because, out of the hundreds of articles that    were in the national press, most would remark favorably about Monticello's admirable    lack of defensiveness in accepting with alacrity the verdict of science on an    old and festering controversy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Caretakers at Monticello cannot help but want    to celebrate their own impartiality and to downplay the contested nature of    history itself, even in the face of clear evidence to the contrary. A vernacular    skepticism about the motives and truth of public history results. In the vernacular    view, official history will always be a whitewash. Like the Stalinist history    Milan Kundera exposes in <I>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</I>, an official    narrative is a photograph out of which the purged politico has been airbrushed.    That Monticello produces official history in this pejorative sense is what many    of Monticello's visitors persist in believing, even as the Foundation attempts    to be more inclusive and more attentive to the sensitivities and demands of    hitherto ignored constituencies. This, in the end, is the lesson the Woodsons    learned. One imagines that their experience continues to exemplify what many    African Americans believe about sites such as Monticello. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">What can museum professionals do about this?    Will they ever be able to produce a past that makes for a more inclusive community    of memory, a past that would create and maintain a more cohesive identity? I    would argue that the solution lies in a much more radical form of honesty than    is current practice at Monticello and places like it. Monticello needs ultimately    to convey its past complicities in history's inevitable erasures. To Jordon    and other caretakers of Monticello, the landscape they preside over is a more    or less accurate if partial facsimile of the truth. They strive, they constantly    assert, to make a hitherto hidden landscape more visible, truer, as they sift    through the evidence and listen to the testimony of experts. But they also want    "the public" to applaud their efforts – to trust them as "stewards",    as Jordon put it to me, of a collective past. This requires an inevitable erasure    which is far more subtle than the crude airbrushing of totalitarian regimes.    At Monticello, this erasure entails purging from the public memory of the site,    not only the profundity of disagreements among the public about what counts    as history (whether slavery or the Declaration of Independence is the more important    story), but the contested nature of history making itself (which is never as    disinterested and objective as Jordon's acceptance of the fait accompli of the    DNA evidence would make it appear) in favor of commemorating its calculated    objectivity. As a result, Monticello, perhaps because of its desire for consensus,    ends up producing two parallel landscapes that together add up to the terrain    of modern democracy: a visible landscape of shared knowledge without controversy    or conflict, and an invisible landscape of suspicion, mistrust, and paranoia.    </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>References </b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">ANDERSON, B. <I>Imagined communities</I>: reflections    on the origin and spread of nationalism.

Joseph, J. Ellis (1997), while claiming to a certain agnosticism on the topic,    concluded that "within the scholarly world and especially within the community    of Jefferson specialists, there seems to be clear consensus that the story is    almost certainly not true. Within the much murkier world of popular opinion,    especially within the black community, the story seems to have achieved the    status of self-evident truth" (Ellis, 1997, p. 303). Ellis counts himself    as a member of what he calls "the scholarly world" because for him    too the "likelihood of a liaison is remote" (Ellis, 1997, p. 303).    The African American legal scholar Annette Gordan-Reed's (1997) brilliant and    meticulously argued case for Jefferson's paternity should be read as Ellis'    opposite. It is a generally accepted argument among African-American intellectuals    and historians that Jefferson's liaison was a fact and its cover-up a signal    example of the more general tendency in the white community to deny such relationships.    Indeed, it could be argued that such a history of denial is at the root of the    invention and maintenance of distinct racial categories in America. </font></p>      ]]></body><back>

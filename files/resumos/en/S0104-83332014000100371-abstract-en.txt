Women became, mainly from the 13th century on, a disturbing "issue" concerning their gender. Both as they began taking a more active role in their traditional female duties as well as when they started taking upon themselves roles that were exclusively masculine, up to that time. The dissatisfaction generated by this process increased even more the conflict between sexes. A highlight of this gender conflict is the movement called "Querelle des Femmes". Isabel de Villena is a spanish representative of this movement with her book "Vita Christi".

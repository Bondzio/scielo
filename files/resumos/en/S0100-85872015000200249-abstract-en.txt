Abstract The important role that liberationist Christianity has played in Argentina in shaping and conceptualizing not traditionally political and social movements centered left has often been overlooked. In this article we argue about the presence of a political-ideological Christian matrix, ie, a particular tradition of objectifying the social and the political, operating at the origin of this social left. Subsequently some common features from the new Latin American social movements are analyzed and a parallel is established between their ways of categorizing social and those typical of the Christian movements. Finally, a survey of these categories is made in an editorial note of the Alternativa Latinoamericana review, used here as a document of the Christian ecumenical discourse in Argentina 80s.

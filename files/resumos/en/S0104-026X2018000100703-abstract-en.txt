Abstract: This paper aims to analyze the actions developed by the collective Guerreiras Project, which focuses on the empowerment of women through soccer. Therefore, we used the documentary and iconographic sources produced by the group itself, as well as academic publications and nonacademic that reference it. We seek in the oral history a theoretical and methodological resource for the production of sources, through interviews with some of its members and with football players whose narrative somehow interacts with the Guerreiras Project, with its creation and expansion. The source analysis was developed taking as inspiration the evidential method proposed by Carlo Ginzburg, from which we describe some fragments of the history of Guerreiras Project, with emphasis on its creation, the development of its pedagogical proposal and its political intervention.

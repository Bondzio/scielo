Any representation of a landscape includes a narrative about the imprints left by its inhabitants on it. Discourse on the scenarios of the nation is always discourse on history. The cinema of our days, fulfilling the role of historical painting and landscape painting in the past, yields to this principle as well. Therefore, the landscape that serves as scenario for the contemporary Argentine filmography has, at its horizon, a frontier always described as an unsurpassable barrier. This theme of claustrophobia as inhering in a national landscape coincides with other discourses of a &#8220;search on the other side&#8221; for a breathing escape and a renewal, as, for example, that of the agents who re-introduced the African religion in Argentina, since the 60&#8217;, importing it from Brazil.

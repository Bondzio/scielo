Abstract: This article is an investigation of the importance of the Brazilian Feminist Crusade, a creation of Martha Hollanda in 1931, in the construction of a new feminist political culture in which women debate gender inequality and struggle for egalitarian rights between the years of 1927 and 1932. The Brazilian Feminist Crusade made a strategic use of newspapers as the main mass medium at the time when the female subject of law was instituted and daily newspapers formed a public opinion. The feminists enlarged the scope of the demands for equality, called into question the different asymmetries of a Republic that was liberal and short on democracy, they contested the naturalization of the difference between the sexes and fought for the widening of citizenship and democracy in the soil of Pernambuco. We are, all of us, the beneficiaries of these feminist struggles, so little known to History.

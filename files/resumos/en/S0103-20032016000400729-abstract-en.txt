Abstract: The National Biodiesel Production and Use Program (PNPB) was created so as to introduce biodiesel in the Brazilian energy matrix. Biodiesel is mainly commercialized through auctions regulated by the National Oil, Natural Gas and Biofuel Agency (ANP) to ensure the adequate functioning of the stock system due to the progressive increase in the mandatory adding of biodiesel to diesel fuel. The aim of this study was to identify the factors influencing the evolution of the Brazilian biodiesel market from a supply perspective as a result of the public auctions held by the ANP. The results of the study showed that, initially, the Brazilian biodiesel market is concentrated. However, with the increase in the number of participating companies, the percentage of mandatory mixture and the improvements in the legislation regarding the PNPB and the auctions, the market has become moderately concentrated. The study also found that the biodiesel sector may be characterized as pure oligopoly, where there are no differences among products, few companies are responsible for most of the production and there are barriers to entry due to the requirements that must be met by the companies to participate in the auctions.

Abstract: In this article, we discuss the body production of transvestites and transsexuals, questioning the effects on their subjectivation processes. Therefore, we analyzed statements produced from the methodology of Thematic Oral History and Participant Observation. In the constitution process of travestilities and transsexualities, investing in the manufacturing of a female body is a way of making it visible and attractive. Prostitution is highlighted as an experience that produces effects in the construction of femininity and self-manufacturing. From techniques of the self, transsexuals and transvestites bring up different subject positions, showing other possibilities of living genders and sexualities, challenging, in many cases, heteronormativity.

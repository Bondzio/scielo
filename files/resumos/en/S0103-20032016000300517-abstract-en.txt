Abstract: This work aims to analyze the evolution of land productivity in the Southern region of Brazil, identifying the existence of a convergence process. In order to do that, we measured the land productivity in 1995/96 and in 2006 and we used this variable as dependent in a convergence model. Subsequently, we estimated a convergence model using spatial econometrics. As a result, we confirmed the convergence process hypothesis (absolute and conditional) in the Southern region of Brazil.

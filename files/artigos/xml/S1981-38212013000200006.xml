<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In spite of the    recent progress in the discussion on vote regional concentration brought by    Avelino et al. (2011), there is still a lack of determination of the districts'    internal areas where candidates obtained their votes. Synthetic concentration    indices, as the G index, do not allow for evaluation in disaggregated levels,    as municipalities, which would be relevant for the verification of the areas    of a candidate's political influence. This paper aims at bridging this gap through    the joint utilization of two other indicators, the Location Quotient (LQ) and    the Horizontal Cluster (HC), that use different measurement units. These indices    were applied to the elections of federal representatives in Brazil from 1994    to 2010, and the results were compared to those obtained by Avelino et al. (2011).    The application reaches its aimed result, clearly showing the places where the    candidates' votes are located in the electoral districts.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords:</b>    Vote Concentration; proportional elections; G Index; LQ Index; HC Index</font></p> <hr noshade size="1"/>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study by Avelino    et al. (2011) represents an advance in the debate on vote regionalization for    Brazilian elections. As acknowledged in the literature, the regional aspect    is fundamental for the understanding of the Brazilian political dynamics mainly    because of electoral rules for legislative elections: a proportional method    with open list in multimember districts (Ames, 1995a, 1995b; Mainwaring, 1991,    among others).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, authors    suggest there are deficiencies in the indicators of vote regionalization and    suggest a new indicator, the G Index, to measure the vote concentration level    for each candidate.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The use of this    indicator, however, does not attend to other aspects in the debate, for it does    not give information in disaggregated levels of analysis and, thus, does not    allow for the identification of the particular areas where the candidates' votes    are located. These are relevant aspects, for one does not expect either homogeneous    or random vote distributions across cities: the votes should reflect the candidates'    efforts to attract sections of the electorate, be it during the campaign or    during their mandates. In addition, in order to observe the formation of "reduto"<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a>    (Hunter and Power, 2007; Zucco, 2008), a phenomenon territorially located, indicators    of these areas are required. To this effect, we need measures capable of giving    disaggregated information on the vote concentration of legislative candidates.    The proposed measures are the Location Quotient (LC) and the Horizontal Cluster    (HC), taken from indicators used in industrial economics to evaluate the spatial    concentration of economic activity. These measures will be applied to federal    representatives' elections from 1994 to 2010 in S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper is divided    in three sections. The next section presents the indicators. The following section    presents the results when the indicators are applied to cases highlighted in    Avelino et al. (2011), in order to show their coherence to the results obtained    with the G Index. Last, we present final considerations.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The LQ and HC    Indices</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As pointed to in    Avelino et al. (2011), the traditional indicators of vote concentration are    problematic and need to be replaced. The suggested new indicator, the G Index,    intends to fill the gap, evaluating the spatial concentration of the vote for    a particular party or candidate across the whole district. Its formula is given    by the expression</font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06s1.jpg" align="absmiddle"></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">where P<sub>im</sub>    is the percentage of the vote obtained by the <i>i</i> party in the <i>m</i>    municipality and P<sub>m</sub> is the total percentage of the vote of the municipality    <i>m</i> in the state total vote. The difference between the party's share of    the vote in a given municipality and that of the municipality's in the state's    total detects the relative dispersion of the party's vote. Thus, the G Index    is a measure of the gross spatial concentration (in the terms of Ellison and    Glaeser, 1994) of the party's vote. As this indicator uses proportions, these    can be computed for different aggregation levels. The LQ and HC indices, in    their turn, allow for a relative evaluation of the regional dispersion of the    votes obtained by a specific candidate.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To this end, they    overcome two important difficulties. First, they control for the result of the    relative size of each city's electorates, since in Brazil cities in each district    are very heterogeneous as to the size of their electorates. The second advantage    is the presentation of an easily interpretable indicator, whose meaning clearly    shows the regional distribution of the vote. We believe both indicators operated    successfully in this experiment.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To make things    clear, we recur to an analogy: assume that each candidate's vote was previously    established in an hypothetical ballot box where voters would randomly take a    ballot in order to deposit it in the official ballot box. In this imaginary    situation, we would expect to find for each candidate a larger number of votes    in cities with the larger number of voters. In other words, the expected spatial    vote distribution would be random relative to municipalities, implying that    an eventual vote concentration would be a strict function of the number of voters    in each city; at the same time, it would be homogeneous relative to the number    of voters in each municipality, for there would not be particular interests    altering the result. The resulting regional distribution would be due to chance    and the representative would be elected according to the total of votes obtained,    regardless of their spatial distribution. As we know, this is not what happens.    Candidates campaign in specific areas, even when this does not result in concentrated    votes (Avelino et al., 2011). But the identification of the places of interest    for each candidate may be determined, if we control for the number of voters    in each municipality.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to overcome    this difficulty, we first suggest the utilization of the Location Quotient (LQ),    as utilized by Bendavid-Val (1991). Briefly, the LQ may be defined as a measure    comparing the proportion of jobs in an activity sector in a regional level to    that that would be expected due to the participation of that region in the total    work force in the larger area of analysis, be it state or nation. This index    shows the relative importance of each region in the sector of the economy under    scrutiny, determining if there are work places above what would be expected    for that city's size. Thus, an adaptation for electoral results is</font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06s2.jpg" align="absmiddle"></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">where <i>V<sub>im</sub></i>    is the total of votes cast for candidate <i>i</i> in the municipality <i>m,    V<sub>m</sub> =</i> <img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06s3.jpg" align="absmiddle"><em>,<sub>Vi</sub></em>&nbsp;    = <img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06s4.jpg" align="absmiddle"> and&nbsp;    <img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06s5.jpg" align="absmiddle">.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">    For the computation of the concentration in each municipality,<a name="top2"></a><a href="#back2"><sup>2</sup></a>    LQ is a simple measure, for it allows for direct inference of the vote proportion    cast for the candidate in each municipality above what would be expected if    its spatial distribution was homogeneously distributed relative to the number    of voters and to the total votes cast for the candidate. The numerator measures    the proportion of votes cast for the candidate in a given municipality, and    the denominator, the proportion of votes of the city in the district total.    Thus, when LQ equals 1, it means that the candidate obtained exactly the number    of votes expected in that municipality if the vote distribution was homogeneous,    given the total vote cast for the candidate; if it equals 2, the candidate had    obtained twice as much as was to be expected, and so on. That information allows    for the comparison of the vote obtained per municipality in a homogeneous distribution.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the LQ, Figleton    et al. (2005) propose an adaptation to treat the information on concentration,    keeping the original unit with a new index, the Horizontal Cluster (HC).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Assume that is    the amount of votes that would equal the LQ observed for a candidate in a given    municipality to 1. The HC would be equal to <img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06s6.jpg" align="absmiddle">    . In other words, if, when LQ equals 1, we have <img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06s9.jpg" align="absmiddle">    , then we may say that <img src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06s10.jpg" align="absmiddle">.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, HC will be    larger than zero when LQ is larger than 1, indicating the quantity of votes    the candidate obtained above what would be expected in a strictly homogeneous    vote distribution. On the other hand, HC would be negative when LQ is smaller    than 1, showing exactly how many more votes the candidate would need to reach    the homogeneous distribution. Such an index has an even simpler interpretation    than LQ, that is, the number of votes above (or below) the homogeneous distribution.    A HC equal to 500 indicates thus that the candidate got 500 votes above what    would predict the homogeneous distribution. If, on the one hand, LQ gives information    that controls for that difference relative to the population in each place,    HC informs the size of that difference in number of votes. Both indices allow    for an understanding of the vote concentration phenomenon.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Application    to Selected Cases</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Avelino et al.    (2011) present cases of representatives whose concentration indices where large    in given elections, suggesting vote concentration. We computed the respective    LQs and HCs for some cases and drew maps from the results. For the LQ maps,    the intervals were created in terms of the standard deviation of the data for    the most recent election disputed by the candidate, and were kept constant for    previous elections. As to HC, we used the same intervals in all maps, in order    to make them comparable for the unit is the same (number of votes). All municipalities    where the candidate fared a value smaller than zero - less votes than were to    be expected under the homogeneous distribution hypothesis - and a LQ of less    than 1 were classified as "negative performance". Other categories inform how    many votes the candidate got above those expected under the homogeneous distribution    hypothesis. The HC maps show the outline of the administrative sectors to allow    for the identification of regions of relative "advantage" of the candidates.    The following analysis extends the applications of these indicators.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>I. Antonio Carlos    Pannunzio</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His votes are concentrated    around the region of Sorocaba, center-west of S&atilde;o Paulo state, up to    the limits with Paran&aacute; state. <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06t01.jpg">Table 1</a>    shows the evolution of the G Index and of the electoral results, with their    respective concentration of his votes in three of the region's cities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Pannunzio's vote    becomes less concentrated across time. This may be seen in the values of the    G Index. The municipal concentration gets systematically lower from 0.67 in    1994 to 0.12 in 2006, with a slight increase to 0.23 in 2010.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is reflected    in the other indicators. In the major town in the region, Sorocaba, with 350,104    voters in 2010, LQ is reduced from 63.5 in 1994 to 19.8 in 2006, with an increase    to 28.8 in 2010. This amounts to say that the candidate obtained in 2010 28.8    times the votes he would have received in a homogeneous spatial distribution,    given the city's size and the total votes received. The HC index is expressive    enough in all elections considered, highlighting the importance of this municipality    for the candidate. In terms of interpretation, HC shows that of his total 38,505    votes, 37,170 are above what would be expected under the homogeneous spatial    distribution hypothesis. On the other hand, Tatu&iacute; presents a large HC    only in the 2010 election, with 6,060, a LQ corresponding to 26.3. With a total    number of voters of 62,717 in 2010, its importance for Pannunzio increases only    in the last election. Votorantim presents the same pattern of LQ observed in    Sorocaba: a decrease from 1994 to 2006, with some increase in 2010. In <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06f01.jpg">Figure    1</a>, these variations are clearly visible. To the left are the figures representing    the LQ values and, to the right, those of HC. We observe the increase of the    mass of municipalities with a positive HC, or, alternatively, with the larger    LQ, from 1994 to 2006, with some retraction in 2010. In 2006, there are small    concentrations in the State's north, but they disappear in 2010.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>II. Marcelo    Fortes Barbieri</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Marcelo Barbieri's    votes are situated especially in the Araraquara region, in the State's central    region. Along the three elections he disputed, his votes concentrate in this    area. <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06t02.jpg">Table 2</a> presents the concentration indices    for the 1994 to 2002 elections in which the candidate concurred.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As mentioned in    Avelino et al. (2011), the votes are less concentrated across time, what is    shown by the values of the municipal Index. This index decreases between elections:    in 1994, it is 0.49 and lowers to 0.2 in 2002. In terms of the regional distribution    of the votes, as in the previous case, there is a central city, in this case    Araraquara, around which the votes are relatively dispersed. There, the LQ values    are also reduced across time. In 1994, its value is 120.5, and falls to 76.7    in 2002. A similar profile is that of Am&eacute;rico Brasiliense. The LQ value    decreases from 91.9 to 39.8 between 1994 and 2002. On the other hand, in Mat&atilde;o,    the LQ falls between 1994 and 1998, but increases again in 2002. This finding    allows for the highlighting of the relative importance of the region's largest    city on the concentration indicators, for they vary in the same direction, and    at the same time shows that that the values of G and LQ bring about different    evaluations. Finally, the values of HC show that Araraquara is decisive for    Marcelo Barbieri's total vote throughout the three elections. The other two    cities, even if they present the largest HCs, have a lesser contribution for    the spatial vote concentration. That information becomes evident in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06f02.jpg">figure    2</a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In these maps,    the decrease in the concentration of the vote between elections is clearly shown.    In 1994, the concentration was clearly defined as shown both by LQ and HC, with    few municipalities outside and far of the darker areas of the maps. In subsequent    elections, the area becomes less compact and cities appear where the indices    are as large as those around Araraquara. That decrease in concentration becomes    evident throughout the whole state of S&atilde;o Paulo.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>III. Francisco    Marcelo Ortiz</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In another region    of the State, Guaratinguet&aacute;, in the state's northeast, is pointed to    by Avelino et al. (2011) as having a concentrated vote that becomes decentralized.    <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06t03.jpg">Table 3</a> presents the concentration indices in    the three elections in which he participated, from </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2002    to 2010.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The G Index presents    this decrease in vote concentration, falling from 0.5 in 2002 to 0.28 in 2010.    In Guaratinguet&aacute;, LQ reaches 212.3 in 2002, falling continuously to still    high 157.6 in 2010. In other words, the representative got 157 times the vote    he would get under the hypothesis of a homogeneous spatial distribution of the    vote. HC also expresses the situation in this municipality, where the total    vote was 71,827 in 2010 and Ortiz got 18,266 more than predicted by the homogeneous    distribution. Its importance is even more significant when we contrast Guaratinguet&aacute;    with the other two cities. In Lorena and Aparecida, while LQ is high enough,    HC oscillates around 4 and 3 thousand. This information only emphasize the importance    of Guaratinguet&aacute; for this representative's total vote.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06f03.jpg">Figure    3</a> presents the maps for both LQs and HCs for the three elections. As with    the previous cases, we observe the same pattern of evolution over time: there    is a clearly defined concentration in the first election that loses its defined    contour in the subsequent elections. In this case, Ortiz gets his votes in the    Vale do Para&iacute;ba region in 2002. There is practically no municipality    with a positive HC in that election. But in 2006, cities beyond that region    present higher values for both LQ and HC and the values for the original concentrated    municipalities are generally lower. In 2010, the process becomes stronger, pointing    to a higher dispersion of the vote in that area.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>IV. Telma de    Souza</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, Telma    de Souza repeats the previous cases relative to concentration, with an exception:    her vote is concentrated from the first to the second election and loses concentration    from then on. <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06t04.jpg">Table 4</a> presents the information    from the indices computed for her vote from 1994 to 2006.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The G Index departs    from 0.31, the smallest value in the series, increases in 1998 and declines    afterwards down to 0.35 in 2006. As her votes come principally in the Baixada    Santista, southern coast of S&atilde;o Paulo, the cities where her votes concentrate    are Santos, S&atilde;o Vicente and Guaruj&aacute;. In the former, LQs vary between    35 and 45, and this was represented by a HC of more than 80 thousand votes in    1998, in other words, around 30% of the total votes in the city and 60% of the    vote the candidate obtained in that election. For the other two cities, the    values for both LQ and HC are lower, with LQ around 17 in the former and 14    in the later, while HC averages a little bellow 17 thousand in S&atilde;o Vicente    and 11.5 thousand in Guaruj&aacute;. In the graphic representation in the maps,    presented in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v7n2/06f04.jpg">figure 4</a>, the representative's concentration    tendency is very clear.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1994, while    her main source of votes was located along the coast, there are little spots    elsewhere, especially in the Registro area. According to the G Index, this is    the year when the phenomenon presents its greater intensity. In 1998, the spots    are practically limited to coastal cities, reaching other cities gradually in    subsequent elections, including again the Registro area.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Last Remarks</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The indicators    presented, LQ and HC, are capable of showing the areas of vote concentration,    controlling for the size of the population and the representative's total vote.    In this sense, they are complementary to the G Index presented by Avelino et    al. (2011). It is worth emphasizing that the variations in all the indices considered,    Municipal G, LQ and HC will not always be in the same direction throughout all    cities. The joint movement of G and LQ may happen when there is a city relatively    larger with regard to the others where the representative has gotten many votes,    as happened in the case of Antonio Pannunzio in Sorocaba. On the other hand,    the indicators reveal the spatial dynamics across the territory, allowing for    analyses to be constructed from these results.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, it must    be mentioned that, in spite of the data that point to the areas where representatives    get their votes, there is not a necessary association with the construction    of electoral dominance areas. In the cases here presented, it is a well known    fact that Iara Bernardi gets a concentrated vote in the Sorocaba region, as    does Pannunzio; that Angela Guadagnin concentrates her vote in the Vale do Para&iacute;ba,    as does Marcelo Ortiz; and that Paulo Mansur shares the Baixada Santista with    Telma de Souza. These results call for more research to discuss the formation    of informal electoral districts.</font></p>     ]]></body>

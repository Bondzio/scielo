In this article, a few results of a research called 'The pedagogue and his/her professional identity: the case of Pedagogy graduates from the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de Mexico (UNAM) and Universidad Veracruzana (UV)' are presented. The study had two aims: a) to identify the processes of identity construction among pedagogues graduated from these universities in the decades of 1950, 1970 and 1990, according to their undergraduate study programs; and, b) to point out the characteristics which defined their identities. The central question of the investigation was: which were the characteristics that constituted UNAM's and UV's pedagogue identity, and of which pedagogue identity are we talking about? After having interviewed 12 pedagogues (six per institution and two per generation) and analyzed their statements and documents (such as their study programs, papers published etc.), it is possible to say, in the light of the theoretic framework and considering the research's questions, that the pedagogue identity encompasses a historical, relational and hybrid identity: the pedagogue is a professional who performs several functions, all of them linked to a sector of education (formal, non-formal and informal), considering them, however, in a very distinct manner in relationship to other education-related professions.

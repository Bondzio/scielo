This paper analyzes the crisis in Physical Education, considering it historically in relation to the crisis in Modernity itself. Firstly, we introduce the object of conflict between mind and body (reason and sensitivity) to point this dicothomy as the first cause for this crisis. Secondly, we distinguish the "oblatu" and the "transfuga", based on considerations of Ricardo Vieira, applying this distinction to the mind/body dichotomy. In a third step, we emphasize the importance of teaching getting deeper into the process of teaching formation. Finally, we present, based on our academic and professional experiences, examples of real teaching situations and relate them to the lack of epistemological identity affecting the teaching profession, as well as the outlook for the "oblatu" and the "transfuga". We conclude highlighting challenges to be overcome by Physical Education teachers in the continual process of (self) formation, insisting on the view that a greater understanding of teaching can encourage this process.

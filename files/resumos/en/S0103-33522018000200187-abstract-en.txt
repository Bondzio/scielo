Abstract: The paper&#8217;s main goal is to present an original typology of bureaucrats, situated in intermediate layer of the civil service structure. This specific set of players, the mid-level bureaucrat (MLB), is seen as a strategic group, primarily, because of its connection role and position between the top officials and the policy executors. Despite their relevance and well-known heterogeneity, few studies have explored this diversity and the effects in the policymaking. In order to fulfill this gap and deepen the understanding of the MLBs, this article proposes a typology that includes crucial dimensions, such as profile, background and performance, and, thus, empirically confirms the heterogeneity assumption in the Brazilian federal civil service.

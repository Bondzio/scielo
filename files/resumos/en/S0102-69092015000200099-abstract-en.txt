In Brazil, power generation is mainly provided by hydroelectric sources, requiring the construction of infrastructure works that propel a contradictory social process. In this process, one observes the conflict between the Specific Purpose Entities (SPEs), the proponents of hydroelectric power plants, and the Movement of People Affected by Dams (MAB), which represents the local populations compulsorily dislocated. Focusing the basin of the Uruguay River, in southern Brazil, this article discusses such conflict through a frame of analysis involving the hydroelectric plants and the resettlements. In so doing, it seeks to understand the frequency and the motivations of the affected populations, after their relocation, to participate politically in mobilizations against hydroelectric power plants. The analysis uses use a methodology that articulates qualitative and quantitative instruments based on empirical research.

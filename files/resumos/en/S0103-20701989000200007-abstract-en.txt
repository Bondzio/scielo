Morality as a guiding principle for action allows for various approaches, thus suggesting an interdisciplinary treatment of the problem. This essay focus on four of such approaches: the philosophical (Kant&#8217;s), the sociological (Durkheim&#8217;s), the psychogenetic (Kohlberg&#8217;s) and the discoursive (Habermas&#8217;s) ones. The cleavage that orients this selection and defines the themes for analysis is Piaget&#8217;s genetic structuralism, which provides the necessary elements to adequately grasp the problem as a whole. Genetic structuralism is based on reason, includes society in the reflexive process, recreates the genesis of judgement and considers discourse as a fundamental element. Thus Piaget finds support in Kant, takes Durkheim into account, sets the ground for Kohlberg and antecipates Habermas&#8217;s theorization.

The implementation of the environmental sustainability is normally seen to be demanding a consolidation of the democratic process. However, the relation between democracy and sustainability does not only involve a symbiotic process, but can also include a series of challenges not often recognized by those who defend this approximation. Taking the relevant questions to this matter into account, the text aims at examining the limits and possibilities which arise exactly from this relation. Therefore, the text at issue analyses two models of environmental democracy. In the first case we examine the relation between sustainability and deliberative or discursive democracy while the second one deals with the relation that can be established between sustainability and associative democracy. As we can see, these models enable us to catch a glimpse of two types of environmental democracy and at the same time two forms to imagine the main features of democratic politics of sustainability.

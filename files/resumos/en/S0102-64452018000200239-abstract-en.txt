Abstract In the current stage of capitalism, the Argentine labour movement is facing significant challenges due to the advance of neoliberal policies that deepen flexibilization, informality and enlarge the power of large corporations in relation to the State. These processes put into question the forms of resistance and confrontation in a period of increasing labour-capital tensions. This article analyzes the consequences of neoliberal policies over the traditional corporatist model of labour relations in Argentina. It looks at how this transformation is reorganizing trade union action and the need to return to workplace-based unionism as a way to present a direct challenge to capital.

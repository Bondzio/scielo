The concept of the sexual division of labor has a long history. First of all, we will outline the origin of the concept in the French context, quoting some research studies that claim it. We will also suggest our own definition of the concept, which will help us analyze the present characteristics of the sexual division of labor. Next, in a more precise way, we will bring the discussion back to the models that organize the relations between the domestic and professional spheres. We will point to the emergence of a new model, the so-called "delegation" model, in order to conclude with a critical analysis of "conciliation" of tasks.

In this article, we will focus the relationship between society and State using Nonet and Selznick's ideas of repressive, autonomous and responsive law to understand the transformations of "Civilian Police" in three Brazilian states - SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Pernambuco - using the data obtained in the research "Police Stations visitors Week", that evaluates the police districts in terms of community orientation, physical conditions, equal treatment of people, transparency and accountability, conditions of detention and, after that, discuss the results with the chiefs of police, enabling positive changes in the services offered by police to community. Based on the data collected in 64 police stations visited in Pernambuco, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, in three consecutive years (2009-2011), and considering the improvement in the quality of service provided to population, we discuss how the police have became more permeable and responsive to society, despite the persistence of strong repressive traits, such as the weight of the function of order enforcement and a policy of treating the work of police institutions as a secret of State.

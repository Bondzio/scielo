ABSTRACT This article reports on the development of a proposal for teachers&#8217; evaluation, conducted in a public elementary school, located in the city of Brasilia, Distrito Federal (Br). The evaluation process, from the definition of the design to the analysis of its results, involved some of the school teachers. Each step of this process is detailed throughout the study, emphasizing the choices made in conjunction with the teachers. This initiative aimed to contribute to the improvement of the work done by teachers participating in the research, as well as to expand the knowledge on the subject, something that can also help the development of new proposals, albeit with different designs from the one described here.

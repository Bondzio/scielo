The aim of this essay is to contribute with the articulation of a trans-disciplinary research field, political ecology, by means of the comparative synthesis of two works: "The New Science of Organizations" by Alberto Guerreiro Ramos (1981), and "The Mutation Point", by Fritjof Capra (1982). The central hypothesis of this article is that both authors, although with very different academic background, get to very similar conclusions in these two works, under the same emergent paradigm. Given the still diffuse context of environmentalist thought these books may be considered classics of political ecology.

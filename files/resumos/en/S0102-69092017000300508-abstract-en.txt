This article aims to make a discussion of Kimbundu mythical-religious universe (especially the expert of nature and the priests), from the late nineteenth to midtwentieth century. I will make this discussion through the analysis of the work Voices in sanzala: Kahitu by the Angolan writer Wanyenga Xitu (Uanhenga Xitu in Portuguese) that is understood as a social memory of AkwaKimbundu, thus seeking to discuss the processes of mixtures, miscegenation and belongings.

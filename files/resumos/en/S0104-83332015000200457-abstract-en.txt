AbstractThe present work is inserted in the boundaries of Gender Studies, Social History of Press and History of Education. It discusses the role played by a newspaper from Rio de Janeiro, Correio da Manh√£(1901-1970), one of the most expressive Brazilian periodicals in circulation in the 20thcentury and that contributed to women's education during that time. It emphasizes, specially, the decade of 1930, highlighting teachings concerning the acquisition of good taste by women, which, back then, became a synonym of slenderness and youth.

Abstract: The implementation of assisted reproductive technologies in the Rio de la Plata and the cultural senses that underlie this process, allow the reproduction of certain subjects while deny or limit the reproductive potential of others. To distinct which one can be elective for procedures, technologies play an important role in defining what is natural and what is not. In this paper I describe the forms of domination on body dimension that the development of assisted reproductive technologies in the Rio de la Plata imposes to women and which are the cultural bases that support this process. This goal is achieved using interviews with specialists in TRA and also with women who have gone through different treatments. It can be concluded that there is a strong heterocentered order in the practice of rioplatense reproductive medicine in addition to a guidance to take control urgently and specifically to the female body.

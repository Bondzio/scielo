Abstract: Extension approaches and practices have changed enormously during the last decades. At the same time, several authors have pointed out the persistence of traditional, diffusionist approaches in extensionists' practices as well as in extension institutions. In this research, extension practices implemented in the Argentine Northeastern region are analyzed and compared with institutional and current academic proposals, aiming to draw useful recommendations. In order to do so, 40 interviews with rural extensionists who work in the public system in the provinces of Chaco, Corrientes, Formosa and Misiones were conducted and analyzed. Results show that the interviewees aim their practices at the productive improvement and the strengthening of farmers' organizations, value implementing demand-driven interventions, and prioritize group approaches. In general terms, the extensionists' practices are consistent with the National Institute of Agricultural Technology's proposal and with most of the guidelines provided by the specialized literature. Nonetheless, doubts remain with regards to the real value given to group work, interinstitutional articulation and participation. Likewise, the lack of interest about gender issues and evaluation of extension projects are also cause of concern.

Due to the changes in food consumption pattern by Brazilian families, together with an increase in urbanization and women labor participation, this article aims to study the influence of some socio-economic factors on the meat consumption pattern in Brazil. The data set used is a Household Budget Survey - "Pesquisa de Or√ßamentos Familiares" (POF) 2002-2003", carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Heckman two stages procedure was applied to the data to analyse the influence of socio-economic factors on the household consumption of beef, pork and poultry. The results show that the socio-economic and demographic factors have a large influence on the household meat consumption pattern in Brazil.

The fact that aesthetics is one of the guiding principles for curricular organization in Brazil forces us to reflect upon its founding and justifying concept. To this end, we situate the aesthetic principle in the regulatory documents which define and detail the current national curricular guidelines for primary education. We also indicate the foundations that define the aesthetic concept adopted and its relationship with ethics and politics, which are the three pillars that should guide educational practices. Thus, we intend to highlight the purposes involved in the aesthetics of sensibility, revealing its function in the present development stage of the capitalist production mode.

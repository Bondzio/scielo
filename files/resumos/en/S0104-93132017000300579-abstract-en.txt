Abstract This posthumous article deals with the school issue of German immigrants in Brazil from 1850 to 1937. In this period, the State's inability to ensure full access to the public school for settlers' sons motivated the mobilization of community leaders, religious and lay orders for the organization of a particular school system in their mother tongue. The so-called "German" schools lasted until 1937, when the government, preoccupied with assimilation, closed or effected radical changes in schools toward the aim of "abrasileiramento" in the name of national security. The article intends to explore the interfaces between ethnicity and nationalism that marked child socialization in these schools.

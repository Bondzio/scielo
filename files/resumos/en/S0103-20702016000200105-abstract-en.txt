Abstract This paper analyzes the relationship among class structure, patterns of social mobility and voting at the Brazilian presidential election of 2006. The analysis aims to discuss and test the hypothesis of asymmetrical vote claiming that the correlation between social class and voting is mediated by the patterns of upward and downward intergenerational mobility. Other ancillary hypothesis are also discussed and empirically tested. All statistical estimations are done using Bayesian hierarchical models.

Abstract This article, an homage to Mariza Corrêa, looks at two of her most important works: Morte em família [Death in the Family] (1983) and &#8220;A babá de Freud e outras babás&#8221; [ Freud&#8217;s nanny and other nannies] (2007). In the first, Mariza revealed the articulations between gender and class that permeate the legal system&#8217;s treatment of crimes committed by men and women in conjugal relations. In the second, her next to last article, the issue of Freud&#8217;s nanny is the inspiration to examine the torn fabric of relations between class and race in Brazil. Far from being a &#8220;minor&#8221; issue, Mariza shows that the theme of nannies is important to both the understanding of the economy of emotions and to the feminist reflection in contemporary Brazil.

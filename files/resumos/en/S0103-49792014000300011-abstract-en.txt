This article is based on the formulations of Latin-American authors who study the paradigm modernity-coloniality. They suggest that the processes of territorial expansion were, and still are, fundamental for the capitalist logic. If in historic colonialism the plunder of natural resources was done through strength and political-military supremacy of the colonizer State, currently other mechanisms of power guarantee the continuity of the exploration. In order to elucidate this process, the notion of coloniality in the appropriation of nature is formulated, understood as a result of the constructions in the interior of modernity which think of economic-instrumental ways of exploring the environment. Lastly, we go back to discussions regarding the pertinence of the theory of dependence and based on empirical data, suggest the emergence of new downtown-outskirts relations which would be structured by the constant displacement of capitals and by the way big international corporations impose new organized ways of exploring work and nature.

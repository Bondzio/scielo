Increased production of research in environmental management has occurred after international conferences on environment and development, even though the first research groups at USP (University of SÃ£o Paulo) date from the 1980's. These researches are mostly linked to Applied Social Sciences and to the production, planning and economy subjects. USP is reactive to the insertion of the theme in its programs, but environmental management is still peripheral.

Abstract: This article analyses the confrontations experienced by the members of the Sociedade Parthenon Literario, cultural association established in Porto Alegre in the second half of the 19th century, as an attempt to undertake the women's instruction in the SÃ£o Pedro Province. The Society was a space where different interests concerning such matter converged, where different possibilities and projects for the future conflicted. In this power game in which cultural and political models were disputed, we can glimpse the strategies of the stronger or weaker parts involved to accommodate their ideas on the heart of the institution. The main sources used are the texts from the Society Magazine, the minutes of the group and the books of memories written by its members.

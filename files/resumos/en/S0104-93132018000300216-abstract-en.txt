Abstract This article reveals a Ninam model of transformation by engaging their contemporary relations with Evangelical Christianity and the caxiri beer-feasts. It explores how these two paths of transformation - caxiri drunkenness and Evangelical Christianity, each of which articulates, in its own way, continuity with change - are related within the same structure that manifests a characteristic way of experiencing and creating a world in continuous transformation. At the same time, this model is compared with the missionary model of transformation (conversion), in order to accentuate the distinctive features of the Indigenous mode of transformation. The web that connects Christianity and drunkenness, Ninam and missionaries, is thus a privileged stage for envisaging two differentiated models of transformation in relation with each other.

The field of curriculum has been characterized, in different countries, by a remarkable diversity of themes and theorethical infuences. Drawing on Bourdieu's conception of field, the article focuses on the field of curriculum in Brazil, as it has been constructed at the Curriculum Working Group - GT - of the National Association of Research and Graduate Studies in Education - ANPEd. It examines the dynamics of the meetings and analyses it taking into account both the main features of the Association and the recent educational policies for graduate studies in Brazil. It also discusses the papers presented in the meetings from 1996 to 2000. The author argues that the great number of papers has prevented the discussion of major educational problems that should be considered by the researchers. The article proposes questions and suggests strategies that could enrich the process of knowledge construction that has been developed by the Working Group.

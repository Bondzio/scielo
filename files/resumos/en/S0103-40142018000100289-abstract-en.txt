Abstract Scientific progress in Brazil has been subjected to a process of search and evaluation set by international targets and has achieved outstanding results. However, the same is not true for technological development or for school education. With notable exceptions, scientific progress has not translated into competence gains and improvements in the quality of life. The results achieved in science and technology and in the education of researchers are examined here to evaluate the hypothesis that severe contradictions exist between the education of researchers and scientific and technological results, which are in contrast with the needs of a society that strives to achieve tolerable standards, comparable to those of other nations. The discussion points to a strong trend to academicism, both in education and in research, that seeks to repeat results achieved by already developed societies. As a conclusion, greater effort from the scientific community is necessary in the new organizational environment to attain more effective and pragmatic results in research and in the development of researchers and teachers, as a means of making the society the largest beneficiary of knowledge.

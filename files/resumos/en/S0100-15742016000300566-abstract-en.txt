Abstract This article is based on data obtained from a study intended to analyze the government program called Sistema de Proteção Escolar [School Protection System], implemented by the State Secretary of Education in 2010. The current analysis proposes to understand the perceptions of Community Teacher Mediators regarding situations of conflict and violence in their schools. The data show a tendency toward increasing levels of conflict and violence in the school context, mainly with problems caused by students, according to the interviewees. This scenario maybe credited to students' resistance to the professionals' attitudes and the pedagogical practices occurring therein, juxtaposed to the authority socially attributed to the teachers and educational status.

Abstract This article aims to analyze attitudes, values and beliefs of military police officers regarding the engagement of society at large on participatory institutions created by the government of the state of São Paulo and to explore key factors that inhibit or foster citizens' participation. The engagement of citizens was analyzed from their insertion on such participatory institutions, which are here understood as instances of the public sphere that gather citizens for self-consciously organized public consultations or deliberations (Fung; Wright, 2001). From that perspective, we aim to understand the dynamics of functioning and interactions between citizens and public workers on five community councils of public security (Conselhos Comunitários de Segurança - Consegs) located in the territory of the city of São Paulo.

Abstract: Cachaça is considered a genuine Brazilian drink, produced throughout the country and exported to all continents. Given its importance, it is proposed in this paper to describe the stream of the exports, highlighting the importers and producing states, as well as the influence of public policies and legal provisions to encourage the production / trade of this drink. For this study, it was considered a sampling from 1997 to 2015, ranking it among the periods of the administrations of the governments of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, so that the evolution of exports from forming groups, or clusters, of importing countries based on three periods analyzed, could be evaluated. The results showed that Brazilian cachaça exportations and consumer markets have increased over the years, and this phenomenon is related to the state&#8217;s role in the production chain of this drink.

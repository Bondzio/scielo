<p>This article assesses the effectiveness of the 2010 Nagoya Protocol to the
					Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) for addressing "biopiracy" of genetic
					resources; that is, their biotechnological utilization in violation of either
					the provider country legislation or mutually agreed contractual obligations.
					Biopiracy is defined as a problem resulting from a distributive conflict between
					provider and user countries, the practical difficulties of monitoring the
					utilization of genetic resources in a transnational context, and the pervasive
					scientific uncertainty about the nature and extent of the problem. The Nagoya
					Protocol predominantly focuses on compliance management while lacking the
					necessary enforcement provisions for deterring non-compliance through effective
					monitoring and sanctions. Using the example of recent European Union
					implementing legislation, this article underscores how parties may use the
					Protocol's legal ambiguities to soften its regulatory impact on domestic
					industry. As a result, in light of both problem structure and regime design, the
					Protocol only offers modest improvements over the <em>status quo
						ante</em>.</p>

<div id="article-body" class="body">
<p>Since the 1980s, plant genetic resources (GR) are increasingly being used for
			biotechnological research and development. While the largest share of global plant
			biodiversity is concentrated in several countries of the Global South, the technological
			capacities for transforming genetic raw materials into commercially viable products,
			from pharmaceuticals to cosmetics up to improved varieties of crops, are predominantly
			found in industrialized countries. GR had been available to commercial and
			non-commercial users without restrictions under the 1983 International Undertaking on
			Plant Genetic Resources, being considered part of the "common heritage of mankind"
			(International Undertaking, Article 01). Developing countries with large amounts of
			domestic plant biodiversity began challenging this open access regime when unrestricted
			South-North germplasm flows translated increasingly into Intellectual Property-protected
			inventions, with the resulting economic benefits being appropriated by private entities
			originating from the Global North (<sup><a href="#B5">BRAND et al.,
				2008</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B36">ROSENDAL, 2000)</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The term "biopiracy" loosely refers to "the use of intellectual property systems to
			legitimize the exclusive ownership and control over biological resources and biological
			products that have been used over centuries in non-industrialized cultures" (<sup><a href="#B38">SHIVA, 2001</a></sup>. p. 49). Since the 1990s, a number of
			high profile cases of biopiracy have been the subject of intense controversies (<sup><a href="#B2">BARDI et al., 2011</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B17">HAMILTON, 2006</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B24">LIANG, 2011</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B28">MGBEOJI, 2006</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B35">ROBINSON, 2010)</a></sup>. In parallel, conflicts regarding the role of the World
			Trade Organization (WTO) in global governance quickly extended to the linkage between
			biopiracy and international patent law. Since the late 1990s, biopiracy has been under
			discussion in various international settings, from the WTO and its Agreement on
			Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), the World Intellectual
			Property Organization (WIPO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the
			Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (<sup><a href="#B1">ANDERSEN, 2008</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B45">VIVAS-EUGUI, 2012</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B47">WILKE, 2013)</a></sup>. In
			2004, the CBD's Conference of the Parties (COP) mandated negotiations on an
			international regime for implementing the Convention's objective of the "fair and
			equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources"
			(CBD Article 01). This led to the conclusion, in October 2010, of the Nagoya Protocol on
			Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from
			their Utilization (Nagoya Protocol). The Protocol has been signed by 91 states and the
			European Union (EU), and entered into force on 12<sup>th</sup> October 2014.</p>
<p>The Protocol is presently the only international agreement providing a comprehensive
			legal framework for addressing biopiracy, here understood as the utilization of GR
			without the provider country's consent or in violation of mutually agreed contractual
			terms. Drawing on the literature on regime effectiveness (<sup><a href="#B20">HOVI et al., 2003</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B29">MITCHELL,
				2006</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B41">UNDERDAL, 2002)</a></sup>, I assess the
			degree to which Protocol will contribute to fair and equitable benefit-sharing. First,
			focusing on problem structure and regime design, I argue that biopiracy is a
			particularly malignant problem resulting from distributional conflicts between (private)
			users and provider countries<sup>1</sup>, the technical difficulty of monitoring
			utilization of GR in a transnational context, and the international constellation of
			interests. Second, I make the case that the Protocol emphasizes compliance management
			over enforcement, which will likely be insufficient to ensure fair and equitable
			benefit-sharing in those cases where commercial stakes are involved. Third, I show that
			its legal ambiguities allow for the implementation of legislation to minimize the
			regulatory impact on domestic users. In sum, the Protocol is a weak response to a
			difficult problem.</p>
<p>The rest of this text is organized as follows. Section 02 addresses biopiracy in the
			context of biotechnology and intellectual property rights. I highlight the North-South
			dimension of biopiracy while showing that the problem is characterized by significant
			conceptual ambiguity as well as uncertainty regarding its extent and economic costs.
			Section 03 introduces the theoretical framework, drawing on the literature on regime
			effectiveness and compliance. Section 04 assesses the problem structure of biopiracy,
			arguing that both the international constellation of interests and the difficulties
			related to transnational monitoring and enforcement significantly complicate effective
			international action. Section 05 turns to the relevant provisions under the CBD. While
			"biopiracy" is not defined under international law, the CBD's provisions distinguish
			between two types: the acquisition of GR in violation of a provider country's domestic
			laws and regulations on the one hand, and their utilization in breach of contractual
			agreements between the user and provider countries on the other hand. Section 06
			analyzes the relevant provisions of the Nagoya Protocol, arguing both that its
			enforcement components are insufficient for deterring intentional non-compliance based
			on cost-benefit analysis and that the ambiguity of the legal text allows for flexible
			implementation in user countries wishing to cushion its domestic impact. However, the
			provisions on international access standards will facilitate compliance with provider
			country legislation by reducing legal uncertainty, transaction costs and cumbersome
			bureaucratic procedures. Section 07 analyzes the Protocol's implementation in the EU
			which, of all parties, possesses the largest market for biotechnology. I show that the
			implementing regulation emphasizes management over enforcement and exploits a critical
			loophole regarding the Protocol's temporal scope. Section 08 concludes this article.</p>

<a name="idp9436400"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The political and economic context</p>
<p>The expression "genetic resources" broadly encompasses the microphysical properties
				of biological materials from plant, microbial, animal and other sources as well as
				the genetic information which those materials contain (<sup><a href="#B40">TVEDT and SCHEI, 2014</a></sup>). GR find application in a broad number
				of industrial processes, ranging from pharmaceuticals to cosmetics up to
				agricultural and industrial applications. While the technological capacities for the
				utilization of GR are concentrated in industrialized countries, the highest levels
				of biodiversity, and thus of potentially valuable materials, are found in developing
				countries. In 2006, 41.5% of international applications for biotechnology patents
				under the Patent Cooperation Treaty originated in the US, 27.4% in the EU, 11.9% in
				Japan and 4% in the BRIICS countries (Brazil, Russian Federation, India, Indonesia,
				China and South Africa) (<sup><a href="#B44">VAN BEUZEKOM and ARUNDEL,
					2009</a></sup>, p, p. 71). At the same time, 44% of all vascular plants worldwide
				are concentrated in 25 biodiversity hotspots, most of them located in the Global
				South, such as South-East Asia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Madagascar (<sup><a href="#B30">MYERS et al., 2000</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The term "biopiracy" came to prominence in the late 1990s. On a general level, it
				refers to the commercial utilization of GR (frequently originating in developing
				countries) for the development of inventions protected by patents or plant variety
				rights (<sup><a href="#B38">SHIVA, 2001</a></sup>). This poses two distinct
				problems. First, market access for protected goods containing GR may become subject
				to restrictions, as authorization by the rights holder is required for,
					<em>inter alia</em>, import and export (TRIPS Article 28.1.a; UPOV
				Convention Article 1.a.v-vi). Second, most states, with the notable exception of the
				US, have committed themselves to ensuring that any benefits arising from the
				utilization of GR are shared fairly and equitably with the provider country (CBD
				Article 01; see Section 05 below). In practice, this objective is relatively easy to
				circumvent by commercial actors eager to avoid potentially costly compensation
				schemes.</p>
<p>Evidence of biopiracy is mainly anecdotal, and comprehensive assessments of its
				global costs do not exist. As it is considered an illegal activity under the
				domestic laws of many provider countries (<sup><a href="#B34">RENNER et
					al., 2012</a></sup>), it is relatively easy to avoid detection when illegally
				accessing GR (see Section 04 below). Without a global tracking mechanism for the use
				of GR in patent applications, calculating the frequency with which biopirated
				materials are utilized in various innovation processes is next to impossible. More
				fundamentally, any cost assessment needs a counterfactual baseline of the benefits
				that would be received by a provider country, if biopiracy were absent and bilateral
				benefit-sharing arrangements had been negotiated between the user and the provider
				country. However, calculating the opportunity costs of biopiracy based on the
				outcomes of hypothetical negotiation, involving significant uncertainty about the
				future commercial value of inventions developed through the utilization of GR, is
				not feasible.</p>
<p>While biopiracy is not a defined term under international law and is insufficiently
				understood in its economic dimensions, a range of anecdotal episodes exist which are
				widely recognized as instances of biopiracy (see <sup><a href="#B35">ROBINSON, 2010</a></sup> for a comprehensive overview):</p>
<p>- In 1995, a patent for an antifungal product was granted by the European Patent
				Office (EPO) to the US Department of Agriculture and the US-American firm W.R. Grace
				and Company, incorporating genetic materials from the Neem tree found in India and
				Nepal. Components of the Neem tree have been used for traditional medicine and
				cooking for about 2000 years. However, no benefit-sharing arrangements were agreed
				between the users and the Indian authorities. The EPO patent was successfully
				challenged by India on the basis of a prior art claim, leading to its revocation in
				2005 (<sup><a href="#B37">SHERIDAN, 2005</a></sup>).</p>
<p>- In 1999, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted a patent on the
				so-called "Enola Bean", primarily produced in Mexico for export to the US market.
				The patent grant was based on the "distinctness" of the bean's yellow color under
				the 1930 Plant Patent Act. The rights holder initiated patent litigation against
				importers that refused to pay royalties (<sup><a href="#B33">RATTRAY,
					2002</a></sup>). In 2008, a US federal court revoked the patent due to a lack of
				novelty and non-obviousness.</p>
<p>- The Hoodia plant has been traditionally used by the native San people in the
				Kalahari Desert. Being a natural appetite suppressant, it allows the San to hunt for
				prolonged periods of time. A patent for a dietary product based on Hoodia was
				granted to the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)
				in 1997, subsequently licensed first to the UK-based company Phytopharm and
				afterwards to the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever. Due to political and public
				pressure, CSIR agreed to enter into a benefit-sharing agreement with the San people,
				whereby they would receive royalties of between 06-08% of commercial profits (<sup><a href="#B48">WYNBERG and CHENNELLS, 2009</a></sup>).</p>
<p>What these examples have in common are conflicts arising from the intersection
				between sovereignty claims over GR and intellectual property claims based either on
				their immediate parts or on inventions resulting from their biotechnological
				utilization. The differing interests of provider and user countries complicate an
				effective international response to biopiracy, in addition to aggravating various
				problems involving the transnational regulation of private agents (see Section 04).
				As I show in the remainder of this text, both the problem structure of biopiracy and
				the rule design of the Nagoya Protocol lead to low regime effectiveness in terms of
				ensuring that users comply with their benefit-sharing obligations in a transnational
				context.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp9386528"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Theoretical framework: regime effectiveness and compliance</p>
<p>Environmental regimes differ in the degree to which they achieve their respective
				objectives (<sup><a href="#B6">BREITMEIER et al., 2011</a></sup>). Research
				on the determinants of regime effectiveness broadly distinguishes between
				institutional influence and problem structure (<sup><a href="#B29">MITCHELL, 2006</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B41">UNDERDAL, 2002</a></sup>):
				while the particular design of an international regime may be more or less conducive
				to the achievement of a given objective, some problems are intrinsically more
				difficult to solve than others, independent of any rules that states agree on. All
				assessments of regime effectiveness thus need to take into account the particular
				problem which the regime is supposed to address. I follow the general proposition
				that the political malignancy of a problem depends on the international
				constellation of interests (<sup><a href="#B41">UNDERDAL, 2002</a></sup>).
				"Easy" problems are those where interests significantly overlap. Where interests
				diverge due to a regime's potential to produce highly asymmetrical effects, in terms
				of costs and benefits, regime formation becomes politically difficult and there will
				be incentives to defect during the implementation phase. This issue is exacerbated
				by the difficulty of monitoring the utilization of GR in a transboundary context. As
				Section 04 shows, biopiracy is characterized by a high degree of problem malignancy,
				decreasing the extent to which internationally agreed rules can contribute to fair
				and equitable benefit-sharing while creating incentives for implementing those rules
				in a manner that decreases their regulatory scope and depth.</p>
<p>In this text, I assess effectiveness at the level of outputs; that is, the extent to
				which a regime's rules restructure (private) actors' incentives in order to bring
				their behavior in line with a specific policy objective. While effectiveness may
				also be evaluated by directly observing behavioral changes in those agents subject
				to a regime's rules (<sup><a href="#B49">YOUNG, 2001</a></sup>), any direct
				observation of biopiracy faces formidable methodological challenges. In addition,
				with the Nagoya Protocol having been entered into force only on 12<sup>th</sup>
				October 2014, any resultant behavioral changes at the unit level would not have the
				extended period of time required for observation. In the present text, I accordingly
				understand "effectiveness" as the degree to which the Protocol and the parties
				implementing legislation shape incentive structures, with the ultimate goal of
				having users fairly and equitably share the benefits arising from the utilization of
				GR with provider countries and without, however, attempting to directly observe
				eventual behavioral changes by private users. As Sections 05 and 06 spell out in
				more detail, the Convention and the Protocol establish a procedural standard whereby
				benefit-sharing is "fair and equitable" if users abide by the contractual
				obligations that have been mutually agreed between them and the provider country, or
				if the provider country waives its right to require benefit-sharing in the first
				place.</p>
<p>"Effectiveness" is a relational term. In order to assess regime effectiveness, we
				require a baseline against which to compare a regime's actual performance. The
				"Oslo-Potsdam solution" proposes two different standards of evaluation based on
				counterfactual analysis: comparing regime performance to a no-regime scenario; and
				comparing performance to a hypothetical collective optimum (<sup><a href="#B18">HELM and SPRINZ, 2000</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B20">HOVI et
					al., 2003</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B50">YOUNG, 2003</a></sup>). The
				no-regime counterfactual allows determination of the degree to which a regime
				"matters": that is, how far it induces behavioral changes relative to
				business-as-usual. The use of a collective optimum as a baseline focuses on the
				degree to which a regime contributes to problem-solving. Both metrics will be used
				in this paper, and I show that the Nagoya Protocol improves the <em>status quo
					ante</em> by facilitating user compliance with the domestic laws and
				regulations of provider countries. However, it fails to raise the costs of
				non-compliance within those jurisdictions in which utilization takes place, thus
				insufficiently restructuring the incentives of users to ground their decision, of
				whether or not to comply, on cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as user compliance is critical for the Protocol's effectiveness, I draw
				on the well-established distinction between enforcement- and management-based
				approaches to compliance. The former assumes rational actors which weigh the cost of
				compliance against the risk of non-compliance, the latter being a function of the
				expected sanctions and the likelihood of being detected as non-compliant (<sup><a href="#B11">DOWNS et al., 1996</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B16">GUNNINGHAM and KAGAN, 2005</a></sup>). Conversely, the management
				approach understands rules not as deterring and constraining, but as enabling and
				facilitating (<sup><a href="#B8">CHAYES and CHAYES, 1993</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B23">KRATOCHWIL, 2011</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B26">MAY, 2005</a></sup>). Here, actors are biased towards complying with
				their obligations due to the internalization of social norms, with non-compliance
				resulting from incapacity or rule ambiguity. The management- and enforcement-based
				approaches thus propose different ways to ensure that rules are being followed:
				facilitating compliance through capacity building and the creation of rules that are
				easy to follow on the one hand, increasing monitoring capacities and sanctions on
				the other. My argument does not commit to whether one or the other approach is
				superior. As Section 06 shows, the Nagoya Protocol emphasizes management over
				enforcement. While this may ameliorate problems of involuntary non-compliance, it is
				insufficient to deter users that weigh the costs of benefit-sharing, and of
				transactions associated with the negotiation of benefit-sharing arrangements,
				against the expected sanctions resulting from being found in non-compliance. Theory
				suggests that, where actors have well-established preferences as well as knowledge
				of the likely consequences of pursuing those preferences, their behavior tends
				towards rational cost-benefit calculation (<sup><a href="#B25">MARCH and
					OLSEN, 1998, p</a></sup>, pp. 952-953). Thus, where commercial stakes are involved,
				the relative lack of enforcement provisions in the Protocol will matter more than in
				cases where GR are being utilized for non-commercial purposes, such as basic
				research.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp9493424"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The problem structure of biopiracy</p>
<p>Biopiracy is characterized by high problem malignancy. User countries (primarily
				industrialized ones) are biased towards the benefits of biopiracy, that is, the
				appropriation of GR by domestic users without entering into negotiated payment
				schemes. For provider countries (primarily developing ones), the costs of biopiracy
				entail both opportunity costs (through lost benefit-sharing arrangements) and
				potential difficulties with market access in the case of goods containing GR being
				patent-protected in export markets (<sup><a href="#B35">ROBINSON,
					2010</a></sup>). This bias towards the benefits and costs of biopiracy,
				respectively, is compounded by difficulties related to monitoring and
				enforcement.</p>
<p>First, access to GR in violation of a provider country's domestic laws and
				regulations cannot effectively be prevented. While a number of provider countries
				have legislation in place which criminalizes the unauthorized export of domestic
				plant and animal species (<sup><a href="#B34">RENNER et al.,
				2012</a></sup>), many biotechnological applications do not require bulk commodities of
				a particular GR but merely its genetic code. While customs authorities are, at least
				in principle, able to detect the illegal export of singular plant samples, modern
				information technology allows for DNA to be sequenced within a provider country and
				resulting sequence data to be digitally transmitted to third countries with minimal
				risk of detection.</p>
<p>Secondly, once GR have been illegally acquired, fulfillment of the benefit-sharing
				objective hinges on monitoring and enforcement in user jurisdictions. Here, the
				incorporation of GR in patent applications requires a system by which
				legally-accessed resources may be distinguished from illegally-accessed ones, with
				appropriate legal remedies for the latter case. For instance, a number of proposals
				have been made for a disclosure of origin requirement, which would require patent
				applicants to provide evidence that any GR utilized within their inventions have
				been accessed legally and in line with the benefit-sharing objective (<sup><a href="#B10">CORREA, 2005</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B19">HOARE and TARASOFSKY, 2007</a></sup>). Nevertheless, there are legal concerns that
				a disclosure requirement in patent law would go beyond the substantial and formal
				patentability criteria contained in TRIPS Articles 27.1 and 29, and would be
				incompatible with the Article 27.1 prohibition of discriminatory treatment for
				specific fields of technology.</p>
<p>An additional challenge arises from the necessity of implementing compliance measures
				in user countries. States with large domestic biotech sectors lack economic
				incentives for enforcing the benefit-sharing objective under their domestic patent
				laws. Such "strong" enforcement could range from patent applications not being
				processed, in the case of non-disclosure of the origin of GR used in the respective
				inventions, up to the revocation of patents already granted. Here, the position of
				major user countries, such as the US, is that acts of biopiracy can be dealt with
				effectively under existing, domestic patent law (<sup><a href="#B43">UNITED STATES, 2005</a></sup>). For instance, a patent granted for an invention
				incorporating misappropriated GR could be successfully challenged on the basis of a
				prior art claim, invalidating the patent due to a lack of novelty.</p>
<p>Biopiracy is thus characterized by diverging interests between provider and user
				countries of GR. Moreover, the possibilities for realizing joint gains are limited,
				as benefit-sharing arrangements are frequently zero-sum games between user and
				provider countries. While user countries have an interest in international
				cooperation in order to facilitate access to GR by users within their jurisdictions
					(<sup><a href="#B46">WALLBOTT et al., 2014</a></sup>, pp. 38-39), they
				are in a relationship of asymmetrical interdependence with provider countries:
				access to GR depends less on international cooperation than does benefit-sharing,
				the latter requiring extensive regulatory and legislative adjustments in user
				countries. Thus, based on the international constellation of interests, the lack of
				economic incentives for the voluntary sharing of benefits and the significant
				technical and legal impediments to the effective implementation of the
				benefit-sharing objective in a transnational context, not only does biopiracy
				constitute a "hard" problem for international cooperation, but the regime design
				itself, both of the CBD and the Protocol, is shaped by the underlying problem
				structure. In other words: gains from international cooperation in the issue area
				primarily accrue to provider countries, giving user countries few economic
				incentives to agree to far-reaching regulatory standards under international
				law.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp9508896"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Biopiracy, misappropriation and misuse</p>
<p>While the term "biopiracy" is not defined under international law, it is conceptually
				founded in the principle of state sovereignty over natural resources. Principle 02
				of the 1992 Rio Declaration affirms that "[s]tates have […] the sovereign right to
				exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental
				policies" (<sup><a href="#B42">UNCED, 1992</a></sup>). This principle is
				echoed in the CBD's Article 03, and applies both to GR in their natural habitats
				within a provider country ("<em>in situ"</em>) and GR stored in germplasm
				collections within the same or a different jurisdiction ("<em>ex
				situ"</em>). Furthermore, the Convention recognizes that "the authority to
				determine access to genetic resources rests with the national governments and is
				subject to national legislation" (CBD, Article 15.1). While states shall facilitate
				access to GR originating within their respective territories (Article 15.2), such
				access: a) requires their initial authorization, based on what purpose and by whom
				the resource is to be used (Prior Informed Consent, PIC); and, b) the subsequent
				negotiation of a bilateral contract between the provider country and the party
				wishing to utilize the resource (Mutually Agreed Terms, MAT). Bilateral Access and
				Benefit-Sharing (ABS) contracts define the terms under which a private user may
				utilize a particular GR and, <em>inter alia</em>, set out the specific
				details of monetary and/or non-monetary compensation for the provider country. The
				modalities of benefit-sharing are up to the user and the provider country to agree
				on and may include up-front payments, royalties, sharing of research results, and
				joint ownership of intellectual property rights or capacity building.</p>
<p>As commercial users lack economic incentives for sharing benefits, CBD Article 15.7
				obliges contracting parties to take "legislative, administrative or policy measures
				[…] with the aim of sharing in a fair and equitable way the results of research and
				development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of
				genetic resources with the Contracting Party providing such resources". As a
				framework convention, the CBD only creates general rights and obligations related to
				ABS. Their implementation is the subject of the Nagoya Protocol (see Section 06
				below). On the basis of the CBD's distinction between PIC and MAT, however, it is
				possible to differentiate between two legally distinct types of biopiracy:
				misappropriation and utilization "in a non-agreed way" (<sup><a href="#B22">IUCN, 2012</a></sup>, p. 12).</p>
<p>Misappropriation of GR constitutes a case in which a resource has been accessed in
				violation of the provider country's domestic ABS framework, that is, where PIC has
				not been obtained. Addressing misappropriation requires the enforcement of third
				country legislation within a user jurisdiction. Although access to GR in <em>ex
					situ </em>collections is still subject to the PIC requirement, identifying
				the country of origin can be a daunting task even where users are, in principle,
				willing to share the benefits from utilization on fair and equitable terms. GR are
				frequently passed along larger supply chains, including botanical gardens as well as
				public and private laboratories. Failure to identify the origin of a resource here
				may result from the relevant documentation being unavailable or from a user's intent
				to avoid having to enter into benefit-sharing arrangements. Thus, a major difficulty
				consists of determining a reasonable amount of effort that users would
				unsuccessfully have to spend on identifying the country of origin before a GR would
				be considered as belonging to the "orphan" category for which PIC is unavailable.
				Parties to the Nagoya Protocol have committed themselves to considering "the need
				for and modalities of a global multilateral benefit-sharing mechanism" for precisely
				those cases (Nagoya Protocol Article 10). If such a multilateral benefit-sharing
				regime were to be established, incentives to declare a resource as being of unknown
				origin would be weakened, as this would merely switch the applicable benefit-sharing
				regime instead of avoiding benefit-sharing altogether.</p>
<p>Once PIC has been granted, user and provider countries enter into bilateral
				negotiations regarding MAT, that is, the terms of access, benefit-sharing and other
				relevant modalities such as dispute settlement clauses. As a private contract,
				non-compliance with MAT is of a different legal nature than non-compliance with PIC,
				as it constitutes a breach of contractual obligations under private law (<sup><a href="#B9">CHIAROLLA, 2012</a></sup>). The existence of contractual
				rights and obligations allows for better monitoring of utilization. While instances
				of misappropriation may simply go unnoticed due to patent offices not routinely
				verifying whether PIC and MAT have been established, misuse is easier to detect as
				the identity of the user and the purpose of utilization are known to the provider
				country. Further, enforcement is facilitated through the existence of contractual
				obligations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp9524256"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The Nagoya Protocol: scope, user measures, international access standards</p>
<p>Negotiations on an international ABS regime were mandated by CBD COP 7, 2004 and the
				Nagoya Protocol was adopted at COP 10 in 2010 (<sup><a href="#B7">BUCK
					and HAMILTON, 2011</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B15">FREIN and MEYER,
					2010</a></sup>). The present section addresses the Nagoya Protocol's design in
				terms of compliance provisions and access standards for GR falling within its scope.
				The Protocol's "user measures" (Articles 15 to 18) create obligations for user
				countries, to ensure that the utilization of GR within their respective
				jurisdictions takes place in line with the relevant principles and objectives of the
				CBD. The "international access standards" (Article 06) attempt to streamline access
				procedures in provider countries. Those standards are relevant for compliance in
				those cases where users are willing to enter into negotiated benefit-sharing
				arrangements, yet are precluded from doing so by bureaucratic or discriminatory
				legislation. Below, I show that the Protocol is heavy on management and light on
				enforcement, while leaving sufficient flexibility for national implementation in
				user countries to exclude significant amounts of GR from its scope. For those GR
				that remain within its scope, the Protocol and resulting implementing legislation in
				both provider and user countries will facilitate user compliance by streamlining and
				simplifying administrative procedures and applicable legislation. However, being
				weak on enforcement, it does little to deter deliberate non-compliance in cases
				where large commercial stakes are involved.</p>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp9529328"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Scope</p>
<p>Pursuant to its Article 03, the Protocol applies to all GR, Traditional Knowledge
					associated with GR and benefits resulting from their utilization falling under
					CBD Article 15. Read in conjunction with CBD Article 02, this includes "any
					material of plant, animal, microbial or other origin containing functional units
					of heredity" which is "of actual or potential value" and under the sovereignty
					of a party to the CBD. This excludes GR in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction,
					such as Antarctica or the high seas. Furthermore, CBD COP 2 has decided that
					human GR are excluded from the Convention's scope (Decision II/11).</p>
<p>The Protocol's temporal scope was one of the more controversial items of the
					negotiation process (<sup><a href="#B46">WALLBOTT et al.,
						2014</a></sup>, pp. 37-38). From the text, it is unclear whether the Protocol
					applies only to GR accessed after its entry into force, or whether it extends to
					post-CBD or even pre-CBD acquisitions. The default interpretation, in line with
					Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, is that the Protocol
					applies exclusively to GR accessed after 12<sup>th</sup> October 2014, its entry
					into force. Whether the Protocol's Article 3 reference to GR falling under the
					scope of CBD Article 15 can be construed as implying retroactivity or not, is a
					legally contentious question. That is, Article 03 could be interpreted as
					including all GR accessed since the CBD's entry into force in 1993 (<sup><a href="#B22">IUCN, 2012, p</a></sup>, p. 72).</p>
<p>The implications of non-retroactivity critically depend on the interpretation of
					the term "access" which, surprisingly, is defined in neither the CBD nor the
					Protocol. As access requires the country of origin's PIC and possibly leads to
					benefit-sharing under MAT, what precisely constitutes "access" has enormous
					implications for GR in <em>ex situ </em>collections. While those GR have
					been physically removed from their respective countries of origin, access is
					still subject to the PIC requirement. "Access" can be understood to have two
					different meanings: the physical acquisition of a GR in a country of origin, or
					its utilization in biotechnological innovation processes (<sup><a href="#B40">TVEDT and SCHEI, 2014</a></sup>). This means that it is unclear
					whether the Protocol is applicable "at the point of access to GR (in provider
					countries) or at the point of utilization (in user countries)" (<sup><a href="#B46">WALLBOTT et al., 2014, p</a></sup>, p. 37). Under the
					former interpretation, significant amounts of <em>ex situ
					</em>collections fall outside the Protocol's scope and their utilization
					will not trigger benefit-sharing obligations subject to the Protocol's
					compliance provisions. In other words: the Articles 15 to 18 user measures would
					only apply to GR acquired from their respective countries of origin after
						12<sup>th</sup> October 2014. It is precisely this ambiguity which the EU
					implementing legislation exploits (see Section 07 below).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp9541984"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">User measures</p>
<p>The Protocol's Articles 15 to 18 oblige parties to create measures for ensuring
					that utilization of GR within their jurisdictions takes place in accordance with
					the principles of PIC and MAT, as well as with the benefit-sharing objective.
					Article 15 requires each party to take "appropriate, effective and proportionate
					legislative, administrative or policy measures to provide that genetic resources
					utilized within its jurisdiction have been accessed in accordance with prior
					informed consent and that mutually agreed terms have been established". Article
					16 applies a similar provision to traditional knowledge associated with GR.
					Articles 15 and 16, addressing compliance with the domestic ABS frameworks of
					provider countries, are primarily relevant for cases of misappropriation.
					Article 18.2, requires parties to provide opportunities for legal recourse; and,
					Article 18.3 requires them to take "appropriate measures" regarding access to
					justice and the "mutual recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments and
					arbitral awards". Finally, Article 17 spells out compliance support procedures
					applicable to both Articles 15 and 16. It creates standards for an
					internationally recognized certificate of compliance and obliges parties to
					designate "checkpoints" which "collect or receive, as appropriate, relevant
					information related to prior informed consent, to the source of the genetic
					resource, to the establishment of mutually agreed terms, and/or to the
					utilization of genetic resources, as appropriate" (Article 17.1.a.i). Users are
					required to provide the "relevant information" at the appropriate checkpoint,
					and may use the certificate of compliance to do so (Article 17.1.a.iii). While
					the certificate of compliance is conceptually close to a disclosure of origin
					requirement, long discussed both in CBD and other international forums (<sup><a href="#B4">BLAKENEY, 2005</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B10">CORREA, 2005</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B12">DUTFIELD,
						2005</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B19">HOARE and TARASOFSKY,
						2007</a></sup>), it does not necessarily have legal effect under patent law.
					Parties are not required to designate patent offices as checkpoints, and failure
					to produce the certificate (or equivalent documentary evidence) only requires
					the relevant party to take "appropriate, effective and proportionate measures"
					pursuant to Articles 15.2 or 16.2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp9551568"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">International access standards</p>
<p>A common problem with access to GR is intransparent, bureaucratic or
					discriminatory ABS legislation in provider countries (<sup><a href="#B27">MEDAGLIA et al., 2012</a></sup>, pp. 66-71). The Protocol's
					"International Access Standards" (Article 06) were originally introduced into
					the negotiations by the EU as a compliance support measure (<sup><a href="#B13">ENB, 2008</a></sup>). Article 6.3 obliges parties
					that have chosen to request PIC for GR within their jurisdiction to,
						<em>inter alia</em>, take "legislative, administrative or policy
					measures, as appropriate" in order to provide for "legal certainty, clarity and
					transparency" regarding domestic ABS frameworks and for "fair and non-arbitrary
					rules". From a management perspective, those international access standards are
					likely to enhance compliance, as users of GR often face complex and
					intransparent access legislation in provider countries (<sup><a href="#B34">RENNER et al., 2012</a></sup>). We should expect rule-guided behavior
					to dominate over gain maximization in cases where few commercial stakes are
					involved, such as in non-commercial academic research (<sup><a href="#B3">BIBER-KLEMM et al., 2014</a></sup>). For such purposes, the Protocol
					obliges parties to create simplified access measures (Article 8a). By
					streamlining procedures, compliance with the PIC and MAT requirements will be
					enhanced, at least for those actors without a clear preference for commercial

<p>The EU is a contracting party, as a Regional Economic Integration Organization, to
				the CBD. The Nagoya Protocol is a mixed agreement: a number of its provisions fall
				under the shared competence of the EU and its member states; others fall under
				exclusive Union competence (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
				Articles 03 and 04). Regulation 511/2014, approved by the European Parliament and
				the Council in March and April 2014, creates a due diligence standard for users
				utilizing genetic resources and the traditional knowledge associated with genetic
				resources within EU member states. The Regulation applies to GR accessed after the
				Protocol's entry into force and defines "access" as "the acquisition of genetic
				resources or of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources in a party
				to the Nagoya Protocol" (Article 3.3). As discussed in Section 06, this implies that
				the future utilization of GR acquired before 12<sup>th</sup> October 2014 and stored
				in <em>ex situ </em>collections of EU member states is not subject to the
				PIC requirement. As both the CBD and the Protocol leave "access" undefined, the EU
				interpretation of the term excludes large amounts of samples, collected in the past
				but usable in the future, from the scope of the Regulation.</p>
<p>The Regulation establishes three compliance mechanisms: best practices employed by
				users and recognized by the Commission (Article 08), the establishment of a central
				register to which collection holders may voluntarily accede (Article 05) and the
				obligation of users to exercise due diligence "to ascertain that genetic resources
				and traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources which they utilize have
				been accessed in accordance with applicable access and benefit-sharing legislation
				or regulatory requirements, and that benefits are fairly and equitably shared upon
				mutually agreed terms" (Article 4.1). I address each in turn.</p>
<p>First, GR included in the voluntary internet-based Register of Collections may only
				be transferred to third parties subject to documentary evidence that they were
				acquired in accordance with the appropriate ABS laws and/or regulations and, where
				relevant, that MAT have been established (Article 5.3). The Register also requires
				the use of unique identifiers and tools for tracking and monitoring the transfer of
				resources to third parties (Article 5.3.d-e). Second, the Commission may recognize
				best practices when they are considered to implement effectively the due diligence
				and monitoring requirements under Articles 04 and 07. Recognition shall be withdrawn
				when there is evidence that a best practice is ineffective in facilitating user
				compliance. Following a best practice does not automatically exempt users from
				exercising due diligence. However, through the recognition of best practices, the
				Commission can establish a set of voluntary standards that facilitate
				compliance.</p>
<p>Third, Article 4.3 requires users to "seek, keep and transfer" an internationally
				recognized certificate of compliance or documentation of date and place of access,
				description of the resource and the direct source from which it was obtained,
				whether ABS-related rights and obligations, and, where available, access permits
				and/or MAT, exist. Pursuant to Article 4.5, where users supply insufficient
				information or where access and utilization are subject to persistent legal
				uncertainty, users are obliged either to obtain an access permit and establish MAT
				or to cease utilization. Possession of the Certificate or equivalent information
				needs to be documented at the "stage of final development of a product developed via
				the utilization of genetic resources" (Article 7.2.). Additionally, competent
				authorities are required to actively check for user compliance, including the
				possible use of "on-the-spot" checks (Article 09). Where users are in
				non-compliance, member states are required to implement "effective, proportionate
				and dissuasive" penalties (Article 11.2).</p>
<p>The Regulation emphasizes management over enforcement. Where users are intrinsically
				motivated to comply, the existence of best practices and information-sharing under
				the Register helps users to identify the existence of PIC requirements and to enter
				into benefit-sharing arrangements based on MAT. Particularly, for non-commercial
				academic research, the level of compliance will likely be enhanced due to greater
				transparency under the Register, while compliance costs are reduced through
				recognized best practices. Additionally, the requirement that those recipients of
				public research funding, which are involved in the utilization of GR, declare their
				exercise of due diligence (Article 7.1) raises the awareness of the legal
				framework.</p>
<p>In principle, however, the enforcement component of the Regulation allows users to
				shirk their benefit-sharing obligations easily. First, where a certificate of
				compliance is considered unavailable, the minimum threshold for utilization to be
				compliant with Article 04 is documentation regarding date and place of access,
				description of the resource in question, its direct source, and whether rights and
				obligations regarding ABS are present or absent. Access permits and MAT, on the
				other hand, are only required "where available" (Article 4.3.b). Here, the
				difficulty lies in distinguishing between genuine orphan GR for which the country of
				origin cannot be determined anymore, and GR which are falsely declared to be of
				unknown origin in order to avoid the sharing of benefits. Considering the frequently
				long supply chains through which GR are transferred before utilization takes place,
				the requirement to disclose the immediate source may not be enough to establish
				whether or not utilization takes place in accordance with PIC and MAT.</p>
<p>Second, considering the difficulty in determining the precise date at which a GR has
				been added to an <em>ex situ </em>collection, pre-dating the time of access
				to before the Protocol's entry into force removes the resource in question from the
				scope of the Regulation.</p>
<p>Finally, the Regulation delegates the question of sanctions to the EU member states,
				requiring merely that penalties be "effective, proportionate and dissuasive"
				(Article 11.2). While member state implementation, including the designation of
				competent national authorities, is still ongoing, the basic dilemma is that
				countries with strong sectoral interests possess considerable leeway in determining
				the penalties intended to deter domestic users from non-compliance with third
				country legislation.</p>

<a name="idp9577712"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Conclusions</p>
<p>The Nagoya Protocol has been described as a "masterpiece in creative ambiguity"
					(<sup><a href="#B14">ENB, 2010</a></sup>, p. 26), which has "left
				experts puzzled about what exactly has been agreed on for many critical issues, […]
				giving rise to a range of partially conflicting interpretations" (<sup><a href="#B21">ICTSD, 2010</a></sup>). Textual ambiguity has allowed
				parties holding widely differing interests to agree on a legally binding outcome
				after a difficult negotiation process which, until the very end, was in danger of
				collapsing (<sup><a href="#B31">NIJAR, 2011, p</a></sup>, pp. 03-15). While
				the international constellation of interests explains the lack of precision and
				stringency, the Protocol's enforcement components are unlikely to contribute
				significantly to the implementation of the objective of fair and equitable
				benefit-sharing. Assuming that "[w]hen a company's shareholders want the largest
				return from their investment, […] voluntary benefit sharing is an illusion" (<sup><a href="#B39">TVEDT, 2014</a></sup>), insufficient enforcement
				provisions translate directly into low regime effectiveness.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should expect the international access standards and facilitated
				access procedures for non-commercial research to enhance compliance in cases where
				commercial stakes are absent. The Protocol thus constitutes a "mixed bag", with its
				enforcement components falling far short of the demands which provider countries
				have been voicing for over a decade. However, considering the overall problem
				structure, that is, the zero-sum nature of (particularly monetary) benefit-sharing,
				strongly diverging economic interests among key actors, practical difficulties with
				monitoring the transnational utilization of GR, as well as pervasive uncertainty
				regarding the global extent of biopiracy and its costs, the Protocol highlights how
				regime design is (at least partially) endogenous to problem structure (<sup><a href="#B29">MITCHELL, 2006</a></sup>). As domestic measures within
				major user jurisdictions are indispensable for implementing the benefit-sharing
				objective, it is thus not surprising that provider countries, being the
					<em>demandeurs </em>of the Protocol, yet lacking significant leverage in
				the negotiation process, failed to achieve a more favorable outcome.</p>

This article tries to develop an approach, which intends to reconstruct the events of 68 and how they have unfolded in Brazil, focusing on the question of memory and forgetfulness. These events, which were marked by representations of life and death are explored in two registers: that of a past which does not become the past, due to the difficulty of its symbolization - at the limit, the experience of terror as the expressive difficulty of nominnanting the experience; that of the interdiction itself of the past - the amnesty proposed based on the restriction on the investigation of the past and the practice for "normalization" of the society and the politics in the transition process.

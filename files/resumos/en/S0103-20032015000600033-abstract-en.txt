The launch of the LEADER program, in 1991, brought a new dynamic to the rural development policy of the European Union. This instrument designed to promote entrepreneurship, enhancing economic growth and stimulating innovation in rural areas, was distinct from the classical policy models because it is based on a territorial, multi-sectoral and integrated approach. This article aims to analyze the added value, the effectiveness and efficiency of the LEADER program in the Alentejo region, over the first three phases of its implementation. To achieve this goal we analyzed all of the 2.706 investment projects implemented and funded by LEADER, from 1991 to 2006, in Alentejo, under the following analytical dimensions: geographic location, type of promoter, economic activity and nature of expenditure made. The statistical data collected from the national program management entities allowed a descriptive statistical analysis of financial and impact indicators. The results showed that the LEADER program contributed to a new socio-economic dynamics in Alentejo, since it contributed to a specialization of investment around two economic sectors, now considered strategic for this region: tourism and agribusiness. Nevertheless the LEADER impact seems to had little significance regarding R&amp;D expenditure, precisely those activities whose contribution could leverage the competitiveness of local companies.

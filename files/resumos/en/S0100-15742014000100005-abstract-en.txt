This paper approaches an assessment system that has been frequently used in Argentina as well as in a global scale, via implementation of the International Baccalaureate Program. The following pages develop their characterization as a teaching proposal favored by some schools meant to educate members of the elite sector. Concurrently, we analyze how said program effects teachers's labor organization. By doing so, we aim at closing the gap between the teaching work carried out by "elite level teachers" as well-settled figures and the symbolic work of producing the educational acclaim of those groups. We also review how that proposal imposes new regulations on teaching, by resorting to post-bureaucratic means of regulation presented in the schools that embody the internationalization of education dynamics.

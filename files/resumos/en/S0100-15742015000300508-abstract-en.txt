This article is a theoretical study on issues about school inclusion, intellectual disability and teacher training. It discusses the issue of inclusion in contemporaneity, circumscribed by tensions between respect for differences and the exclusionary practices that emerge in an educational context. In light of Historical-Cultural Psychology and the principles of clinical activity, an important theoretical and methodological possibility for teacher training emerges which, depending on the quality of the interventions made by the researcher, can enable the resignification of the praxis of the teacher collective.

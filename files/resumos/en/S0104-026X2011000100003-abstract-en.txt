The sexual position analyzed by Jacques Lacan in his Seminar XX (1973) shows the structure of normative heterosexuality: a binary order of the sexed bodies assuming two exclusive modes of sexuality. This sexual economy encodes the equation having/being the phallus. Facing the lacanian body ethics, feminist thought has posed other sexual positions. I propose to analyze Monique Wittig's radical feminism, interpreting The Lesbian Body (1973) as a critical mode of being the lacanian phallus, and to examine Judith Butler's critique in her discussion of the lesbian phallus (Bodies that Matter, 1993). Butler breaks the exclusive binary logic, opening the possibility for a sexed body to be and to have the phallus simultaneously. Lastly, I will examine the proposal of dildoes that Beatriz Preciado raises in her Manifesto contra-sexual (2002).

Abstract This article reflects on the uses, inscriptions, and meanings of certain social markers of difference in the care of three patients with intersex variations in a high complexity public hospital in Rio de Janeiro. Beyond the social and medical administration of these patients, I analyze the biomedical script for administrating certain &#8220;truths&#8221; about intersex bodies and lives. In the daily regulation of these cases, some analytical themes are brought into play to demarcate the incitement or silencing of the registers of &#8220;difference&#8221; in hospital spaces, notably in reference to the experience of intersexuality.

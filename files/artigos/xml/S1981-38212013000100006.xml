<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The Federal Republic of Brazil seeks to   form a Latin American community of nations through the economic, political,   social, and cultural integration of the peoples of Latin America." So declares   the opening paragraph of Article IV of the Fundamental Principles of the   Brazilian Constitution of 1988. At first glance, one has the impression that   this provision represents a focus of Brazilian foreign policy along with issues   such as autonomy, human rights, self-determination, and others in the same   Article. The reality, however, is quite different, with the cited text   reflecting a time of change when the Brazilian political class was reaffirming   its readiness to establish relations on a new footing with its neighbors,   especially Argentina.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This repositioning of the Brazilian state in relation to Latin   America indicated a willingness to finally overcome Brazil's historic rivalry   with Argentina and strengthen the integration process between the two   countries. However, due to the lasting image in the public consciousness of   binational competition &#150; an image constantly cited as the explanation for the   tensions and crises of Mercosur &#150; there was not sufficient political will to   overcome the burden of the history between the two nations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The core of this problem lies in the way the Brazilian state was   formed, a process characterized for more than a century by latent confrontation   with Argentina over Brazil's regional dominance and international ambitions.   The history of this relationship is the topic of Miriam Gomes Saraiva's book <i>Encontros     e Desencontros: O lugar da Argentina na Pol&iacute;tica Externa Brasileira (Friends     and Rivals: Argentina's Role in Brazilian Foreign Policy)</i>, which analyzes   the development of Brazilian foreign policy vis-&agrave;-vis policymakers'   perspectives on Argentina starting with Brazilian independence and ending with   the government of Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Such a long timeframe requires delimitations either that are formal   and periodic or that are defined by singular moments relative to the whole. In   this book, the story is divided into three phases: distrust and estrangement   (1822-1978), distrust and rapprochement (1979-1990), and cooperation and   tension (1991-2003).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first part of the narrative underscores how a sense of rivalry   was present even at moments when certain Brazilian governments expressed an   intent to establish some kind of rapprochement with Argentina. These efforts   led to periods of relative cordiality between the two countries but did not   produce concrete results capable of establishing new parameters for relations   in the Southern Cone.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This first phase was marked by disputes over the delineation of   national boundaries during the first half of the nineteenth century, due   especially to Brazil's support for Uruguayan and Paraguayan independence from   Argentina. During this period arose the Argentine belief in Brazilian   imperialist intentions in the region and a consequent simmering dispute for   regional dominance. In Brazil, meanwhile, there emerged a fear of the   establishment of an alliance between Argentina and other countries in the   region.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the Paraguayan War this rivalry was put aside in the name of   common interest, thereby ushering in a period of cordiality between the two   countries, although their international alignments remained very different.   While Brazil drew closer to the United States to establish a strategic alliance   with this emerging power, Argentina remained closely tied to England and as a   result grew politically and economically stronger.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suspicions remained during the period from the Proclamation of the   Republic in Brazil to 1950. Saraiva describes this time as a period of   pronounced tension and rivalry against a backdrop of official d&eacute;tente based on   a mutual understanding of the need to maintain regional peace. The author   highlights the influence of the role of the Foreign Ministry in maintaining a   sense of competition between the two nations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The very structure of the Foreign Ministry as established by the   Baron of Rio Branco reflected this tension relative to two aspects of Brazil's   international projection: defining boundaries and identifying allies and   enemies. For Brazilian diplomacy the U.S. became a strategic ally necessary to   ensure Brazil's regional leadership, and so Brazil's relations with its   neighbors were driven by the Monroe Doctrine rather than by Bolivarian   principles embraced by many other countries, especially Argentina. This   divergence further isolated Brazil from other South American nations and   increased suspicions of Brazilian imperialist intentions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over time, a rivalry arose that went beyond the political sphere and   entered the minds of the Brazilian and Argentine people. This rivalry touched a   wide range of facets of everyday life, but perhaps none more so than soccer. In   any case, the book effectively demonstrates how this perception was manipulated   or provoked at various points by groups and sectors of society that had no   interest in rapprochement with Argentina or that saw such overtures as harmful   to their interests.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A good example of this phenomenon was the Per&oacute;n and Vargas   governments' 1950 rapprochement initiative that received strong opposition from   the Foreign Ministry and the Brazilian press, which mobilized public opinion   and the political class against this project. Overcoming these suspicions and   views has not been simple and has required long-term dedication, and Saraiva   shows how this process has been carried out for more than half a century in Brazil   and Argentina.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first clear move in this direction was the result of external   pressure. In the late 1950s, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the   Caribbean (ECLAC) presented economic studies indicating that overcoming   underdevelopment in South America would necessarily depend on surmounting   rivalries and promoting a process of economic integration.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ECLAC's position stimulated the creation of the Latin American Free   Trade Area (LAFTA) in 1960 but did not generate the expected outcomes because   in practice there was no significant change in countries' attitudes towards   their neighbors, especially in the case of bilateral relations between Brazil   and Argentina. The integration that was supposed to promote trust and pave the   way for cooperation instead led to increased nationalistic thinking permeated   by the idea of &#8203;&#8203;autonomous development and the profound distrust   of partners.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saraiva reveals how this attitude changed only in the late 1980s as   a result of two key factors: the move of the military governments of the 1970s   (especially that of Figueiredo) to review the place of Latin America in   Brazil's strategic foreign policy, and Brazil's change in diplomatic outlook in   the 1980s that identified Argentina as a strategic partner for Brazil's insertion   into the new international context.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This new attitude of the Foreign Ministry drove a change in   relations between the two neighbors that was also facilitated, as the author   points out, by the convergence of economic and foreign policy and by Brazil's   focus on political democratization and the institutional reconstruction of the   state. It was at this moment that the Brazilian Foreign Ministry began to   defend the idea of regional integration as a viable tactic to promote these   countries' industrial development and international engagement.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The repositioning of diplomacy and foreign-policy strategy was   reflected in the Brazilian political system as a whole, including the   Constituent Assembly, which incorporated into the text of the new constitution   the issue of South American integration and cooperative partnerships with   neighbors to overcome distrust. In the area of diplomacy, this new position   materialized in the signing of the Treaty of Integration, Cooperation, and   Development between Argentina and Brazil, also in 1988, in an attempt to   advance the process initiated by the Program for Integration and Economic   Cooperation (PICE) in 1986.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This period of rapprochement and relaxation of tensions between the   two nations gave rise to a new stage in relations between Brazil and Argentina   beginning in March 1991 with the signing of the Treaty of Asunci&oacute;n that   established Mercosur. Relative to PICE, this was a proposal for cooperation   that was both broader, in that it incorporated Uruguay and Paraguay, and deeper,   in that it created the possibility of a common market in the region.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In practice, this proposed common market was never implemented,   since Brazil's Foreign Ministry thought of Mercosur as a means to an end -- the   international insertion of Brazil -- and not as an end in itself. This weakened   both the integration process and efforts to overcome rivalries and tensions.   Argentina remained steadfast in its distrust of Brazilian motives for   cooperation between the two countries. This distrust was confirmed in 1999,   when Brazil devalued its currency without giving Argentina advance notice,   thereby throwing into crisis both its Argentina's economy and the entire   integration process, which never recovered from this shock despite partnerships   adopted later.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This unilateral Brazilian action instantly revived the flames of   suspicion. The Brazilian government sought to soften the impact of its decision   by attempting to enhance the weight of South America in Brazilian foreign   policy, but this further damaged relations with Argentina because such a   repositioning was detrimental to Mercosur.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even with the advent of the Lula and Kirchner administrations in   2003 and their strong talk of bilateral cooperation, relations between the   countries remained strained and revealed contradictions within the Brazilian   state. Saraiva points out that while Lula granted more influence to a group   linked to academia and to the institutional structure of the Workers Party   (PT), which advocated broader and deeper cooperation, he at the same time opted   to strengthen the hand of the faction within the Foreign Ministry that pressed   for greater autonomy and regional leadership as part of a strategy to make   Brazil a world power.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Notwithstanding these difficulties and contradictions, the author   points to significant progress in cooperation between the two countries,   despite ongoing rivalry, and especially to the Brazilian government's changed   view towards Argentina as an important strategic partner for Brazilian foreign   policy.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="right"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Translated by Albert Roy Leatherman III</font></p>      ]]></body>

In this article I analyze part of the recent anthropological researches about sexual and economic exchanges carried in Brazil. Taking into account some aspects of the context in which these studies were conducted I consider how they incorporated different dimensions of violence, how they analyze the relations between gender and sexuality and the articulations between affects and money in the realm of commodified sex. Finally, I comment on the singularities of these studies in terms of the international literature about these exchanges.

This work presents the results of a research project on teacher's reception of the curriculum change carried out in Argentina, as part of the educational reform of the 1990's. Since the reform was communicated through printed documents, the analysis of reception considers teachers as readers of texts that, being tools of standardization, delimit the possible and the daily actions that take place in the school environment. Based on the contribution of reception theory to literary criticism, the article analyzes the ways the teachers have read the reform related documents. Questions are raised about the positions assumed by teachers in face of curriculum change, as well as the effects produced in the teaching work by the state devices designed for the curriculum change.

Abstract In the beginning, Argentinian anthropology was confined to physical anthropology, arqueology and folklore. During the sixties, a new approach, from the field of social anthropology, appeared. The discipline had broad aims as to its object (including more than Indians and peasants), and its compromise with finding solutions for the country&#8217;s urgent problems. This conception was threatened by hegemonic theoretical trends during the years of dictatorship which prohibited its practice, persecuted teachers and closed courses. The real consolidation of the discipline only became possible in 1983 with the restoration of democracy.

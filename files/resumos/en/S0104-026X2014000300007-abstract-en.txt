This study analyzes the forms of power/knowledge which govern the practice of group psychotherapy for applicants of sex reassignment surgery in a Brazilian university hospital located in a large urban centre. Through participant observation in group therapy sessions, the hegemonic regimes of subjectivation of the clinic were reconstituted. These regimes of subjectivation work as a dispositif, in a Foucauldian sense, by conforming the participants of the therapy to certain regulatory and disciplinary ideals. Semi&#45;structured interviews with those who underwent psychotherapy complement the theoretical and methodological strategies already described, in order to enable the objective aforementioned, as well as to make possible to visualize some subversions as possibilities of resistance within the hegemonic regimes of subjectivation in the institutional context investigated.

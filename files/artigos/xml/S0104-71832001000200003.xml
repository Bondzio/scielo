Rather than counter    MacDonald's baseless ethnic slurs, in this paper I shall accept his contention    that Boas' anthropology was as much a social and political agenda as it was    a scientific theory. The positions on public policy issues he opposed were informed    (and rationalized) by what its advocates claimed to be science. To be able to    counter the discriminatory policy proposals that followed from this science,    it was necessary for Boas both to challenge its validity and then replace it    with an alternative that would support a more liberal political agenda.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boas did not invent    the idea of fashioning scientific theory for the purpose of advancing social    and political goals. The practice has been part of Western cultural tradition    since the Enlightenment. By the twentieth century it was so commonplace that    most scholars, especially those who favored the political and economic <I>status    quo</I>, had ceased to make explicit the relationship between their scientific    undertakings and proposals for public policy. They chose instead to maintain,    and perhaps even mistakenly believe, that they were doing some kind of value    free, or "pure science". This enabled them to charge those, such as Boas, who    opposed the policies their undertakings endorsed, with using science to advance    a socio-political agenda.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boas and his followers    openly opposed discrimination and prejudice and, since these practices were    rationalized and justified by theories that rested on an evolutionary metaphor,    they mounted a systematic attack against all forms of evolutionary thinking.    The need for an alternative theory to replace evolutionism resulted in the formulation    of cultural relativism with its emphasis on culture as learned and changeable.    The political backlash against public policies and programs put into place based    on this thinking in the post World War II era, combined with new directions    taken within the discipline, explains the vitriolic present day attacks on Boas    and his anthropology by those, such as MacDonald, who oppose the policies he    advocated. It is interesting to note that many of these present day policies,    that resemble those prevailing in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,    base their claims on what are reformulated evolutionary, racial theories. Acknowledging    that the science on all sides of public issues may be used to justify positions    on social policies will enable us to see the debate in a fresh light.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The European nations    that adopted Enlightenment thinking, and the scientific revolution of which    it is a product, first encountered substantial numbers of peoples and cultures    different from themselves after the discoveries and expansion of the fifteenth    and sixteenth centuries<a name="volta2"></a><a href="#nota2"><SUP>2</SUP></a>    when they divided up the world to make it into their colonies and later incorporated    specific parts of it into their respective colonial empires. The diverse peoples    had to be dealt with administratively although they were in far away places    and did not have to be encountered and interacted with on a daily basis by either    ordinary citizens or policy makers. The only Europeans who had to be concerned    with the multiplicity of others were the merchants who traded with them, members    of the military who conquered and then policed them, civil servants who ruled    them and the officials and intellectuals who helped shape and implement the    policies that became the laws that governed them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the centuries    following the discoveries, large amounts of information describing the peoples    of the world physically and reporting on their behaviors, especially behaviors    that differed significantly from those of the Christian elites of Western Europe    who thought and wrote about them, were being sent back home and accumulating.    The question this growing body of knowledge raised for the intellectual community    was how to account for and explain the great range of diversity in both physical    form and behavior found among the peoples of the world<a name="volta3"></a><a href="#nota3"><SUP>3</SUP></a>.    The answer, as it was to be when Thomas Kuhn (1970, p. 3-4) later formalized    the question as the starting point for science<a name="volta4"></a><a href="#nota4"><SUP>4</SUP></a>,    was in metaphor. That is, the world of diverse humanity would be likened to    something familiar (and understood by thinking Europeans) that would make comprehensible    that which was complex and confusing because it was unknown.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By the time of    the Enlightenment, after scientific thought had been separated from religion,    the dominant imagery applied in thinking about the peoples of the world and    their diverse behaviors was that of an upwardly slopping line, or a ladder,    with each group, or their characteristics, placed hierarchically on rungs in    descending order down from Europeans who were placed solidly at the top. This    imagery, as Robert Nisbet (1969) noted, was derived from Greek thinking that    likened human society to a living organism whose growth, from birth to death,    was used to explain the behavior of social groups. For the Greeks, and the Romans    to follow them, each of the many peoples in the world was assumed to have its    own distinctive growth cycle. The Church fathers substituted the idea of a single    humanity whose growth manifested itself in a series of epochs or stages. Secular    thinkers adopted this imagery of developmental stages as their means of organizing    the large amount of data accumulating on human populations. In some scenarios    proposed, total societies were placed in an ascending sequence on the ladder    that was believed to demonstrate the evolution of human society. In others,    isolated pieces of information, describing some aspect of the religious, political,    or other behavior of a particular group were taken out of their lived context    and placed in one or another of the categories of what was presented as a universalistic    developmental sequence (of religion, family, etc.) offered as another view of    the evolution of humanity. Since the standard for which behaviors were to be    considered most advanced were those of the intellectuals who were the authors    of the schemas, the data that differed most from their own beliefs and practices    were taken to represent the earliest or most primitive stages of human life.    The remaining categories were placed in ascending order to represent more advanced    or developed stages according to how closely each approximated the social practices    of the writer.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The imagery of    hierarchically arranged stages of development, that came to be know as the theory    of cultural evolution, took an unanticipated twist when it was placed within    the Linnaean scheme of biological classification. Previously, the focus in ordering    the data on human diversity was primarily the behaviors of peoples in their    social groups with the physical characteristics of the actors being secondary<a name="volta5"></a><a href="#nota5"><SUP>5</SUP></a>.    Now the physical characteristics of the races, the subcategories of the single    species into which all humanity was placed, were equated with behaviors. Consequently,    race and social and cultural behavior came to be fused and seen as interdependent.    The assumption, which is still an unsubstantiated premise in racist arguments,    was that the former, the biological, was the cause of the latter, or cultural.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The racial categories,    in what came to be a variant of evolutionary thinking, were placed on the steps    of the ladder, again starting with the Western Europeans - now as a race, or    series of sub-races - at the top with the others in descending order down to    those races most different from them. Those at the lower end were assumed to    be less advanced biologically and behaviorally than those above them and especially    those at the top.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Without then examining    the relationship between the biological and the social, the evolutionists assumed,    as their intellectual descendants still do today, the ontological priority of    what later became the nature/nurture oppositional debate. This enabled them    to focus on what for them were more pressing (political) questions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As long as the    others were in distant places the practical consequences of this had no immediate    impact on the peoples of the nations to which the writers belonged. Except for    colonial administrators, merchants and soldiers, the policy implications of    evolutionary theory and its racist variant did not impact on the daily lives    of the peoples of Western Europe. This, of course, was not the case in the United    States, or in Western Europe today after the post World War II immigration of    large numbers of former colonial populations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unlike the polities    of Western Europe, the United States first came into being as a colony. The    earliest wave of primarily Anglo-Saxon settlers succeeded in pushing the native    peoples they encountered far enough into the western interior so that by the    time it won its independence most of these "others" were sufficiently far away    so that they did not have to be dealt with on a daily basis. Interestingly,    these indigenous peoples were called "savages" by the Europeans, a name used    for one of the earlier stages in most schemes of human evolution. The peoples    from Africa, brought as slaves, who generally were assigned to the least evolved    category, represented a special situation to which I shall return shortly.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This demographic    situation was to change irrevocably when following its industrialization in    the early to mid-nineteenth century the United States began receiving large    numbers of immigrants. Between 1880 and 1920 some tens of millions of people,    mostly from Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, who differed both in their    physical appearances as well as in their linguistic, religious and other social    behaviors from the Anglo-Saxons, entered the country. How these differences    were to be explained would determine the way they would be treated and incorporated    into the body politic.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first example    of diversity Americans had coped with - aside from the native peoples who had    been removed physically, or at times massacred - were the Africans who had been    brought during the colonial period to work the plantations of the south. According    to the racial variants of evolutionary theory then prevalent in Europe, which    were accepted and used to justify bondage in the United States, Africans were    at the bottom of the evolutionary scale, peoples whose innate abilities were    believed to be so minimal that they were placed even below the indigenous people.    Their descendants were to remain, to paraphrase Carroll (2001, p. 16), the extreme    negative of humanity in (American) popular mythology.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since so many of    the slave masters were among the political elites who participated in the writing    of the American constitution and in framing the laws of the land that set out    what were to be acceptable codes of conduct governing social relations, the    legal system of the United States had built into it a special status for Africans    and their descendants that limited their participation in the institutions of    national life. These slave codes, followed by the regulations supporting segregation    and Jim Crow after emancipation, constituted an extreme model for the treatment    of some post-Civil War immigrants. In the United States, then, racist evolutionary    theories already were in place as an explanation for diversity. It is not surprising    that they were used in public debates on the policies that would affect the    extent to which the new arrivals would be able to participate in national economic,    political and social life. The future of these immigrants might have depended    on where they, as members of groups or categories, would be placed on the imaginary    ladder. Furthermore, the extent to which any specific group could be shown to    approximate Africans, Indians, or others near the bottom of the ladder who were    assumed to be biologically and mentally inferior (Stocking, 1968), would greatly    limit the opportunities that would be available to them; and, in the extreme,    this would lead to proposals ranging from eugenics to the closing off of immigration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Franz Boas came    to the United States at the beginning of the large-scale immigration in the    late 1880s. He was one of the many newcomers whose future would be influenced    by public debates over the abilities and potentials (or lack thereof) of the    various groups of newcomers. By his late twenties he already had earned a Ph.D.    in his native Germany and had served his compulsory year in its military. He    chose an academic career and a life in the United States. "What I want to live    and die for," he wrote "is equal rights for all, equal possibilities to learn    and work for poor and rich alike!" (Cole, 1983, p. 37).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Born in 1858 into    a family that strongly espoused the principles of the unsuccessful revolution    of 1848, Boas, like many German Jews of the period, passionately embraced its    beliefs that included the value of science, its application to acquire knowledge    that would improve the human condition and freedom for the individual to better    himself while contributing to advancing society and the world around him<a name="volta6"></a><a href="#nota6"><SUP>6</SUP></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among the members    of this politically liberal, intellectually self-conscious group that influenced    Boas in his formative years was Rudolph Virchow, "a physician, pathologist,    scientist and radical activist, who was prominent in German science and politics"    (Lewis, in press). Boas admired and emulated Virchow (Stocking, 1974, p. 22)    and took a course in anthropometry with him before embarking on a field trip    to Baffin Island. After participating in daily life there, Boas developed great    respect for the Inuit people and for their customs. He realized how little was    actually known about them, or many other small-scale, marginal (then called    primitive) groups like them, other than the implications to be deduced from    the place assigned them in the varying evolutionary schemas. What he was to    learn about the Inuit, and other people he was to study as his career unfolded,    led him to question the accuracy of the rigid system on which evolutionary thinking    was based. As a result, he systematically opposed all forms of classifying peoples    into categories, insisting instead on the importance of individuality. Given    the social and political implications of evolutionary theories for the American    society to which he committed himself, Boas first task was to challenge their    scientific accuracy, which he would do both theoretically and with ethnographic    data similar to what he collected on Baffin Island. More importantly, he would    re-conceptualize anthropology, which was dominated at the time by evolutionary    thinking (Harris, 1968), transforming it into the science that, in his view,    would improve conditions by advancing his humanistic and individualistic beliefs.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boas began his    re-formulation of anthropology by taking the evolutionary metaphor and turning    it over on its side. The result was a view of humanity in which each group,    or culture, the term he used to refer to the total way of life of each population,    became in a sense like the individuals Boas so greatly admired, each unique    and distinctive with its own practices, values and worth. In terms of this new    framework, Western Europeans and their former North American colonials no longer    would represent the pinnacle and standard by which others were to be judged.    Each culture instead was to be seen as the product of its own unique history    that resulted in a set of beliefs, values and behaviors that were to be accepted    on par, but different from, those of Western Europe and North America and each    other. The implications of this imagery came to be known as cultural relativism.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The behavior of    each individual, always foremost in Boas' thinking, was to be understood and    judged exclusively in terms of the standards prevailing in the culture into    which he had been born and raised. More importantly, Boas and his followers    proceeded with the assumption that human behavior was learned rather than the    inevitable consequences of biology, climate or any other factors. Furthermore,    Boas was to take the lead in promoting the importance of ethnographic studies    - that would lead to the systematic collection of data on the lives and cultures    of peoples here-to-fore unstudied directly by scholars. This cornerstone of    the anthropological science he was building was to be no greater in his overall    concerns than the effort he would devote to helping build the scientifically    based, rational culture that he hoped would emerge in the United States.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boas view of humanity,    as an array of diverse and morally equivalent groups of peoples and their cultures,    was to provide the imagery out from which multiculturalism and identity politics    was to develop in the last several decades of the twentieth century. Ironically,    advocates of these highly politicized positions have vilified Boas, to the point    of even questioning the sincerity of his efforts to counter racism (Visenwaran,    1998; Willis, 1969).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boas was not a    multiculturalist, nor is it likely that he would have looked favorably on movements    of identity politics. As we have seen, he recognized, respected and helped describe    many of the mostly small-scale, local cultures with which peoples now identify,    but he viewed them as anachronisms, to be documented and then discarded rather    than revered. Although he believed that there were things of value in all cultures    that might be incorporated into the rational composite of the future, most customs    from the past, of his own and other societies, were to him more the "shackles    of dogma" (Stocking, 1974, p. 41-42), "the irrational authority of tradition"    (Stocking, 1979, p. 96) than something to be accepted uncritically and perpetuated.    Boas wished to replace custom with new forms according to which it would be    possible to attain the universal rational knowledge that would be the basis    for the culture of the future. In his view each of us, as individuals, should    be provided the freedom to contribute to and participate in the new way of life    being developed. In this sense Boas was an assimilationist and an integrationist.    He wanted everyone to participate fully and equally in the new world under construction.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This perspective    is the very antithesis of multiculturalism and identity politics. It also strongly    opposed the view of American - and world - society that followed from the racist,    eugenicist and other evolutionary views advocated by his adversaries in his    era.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much of Boas' own    research - other than his ethnographic studies - focused on testing, with the    intent of disproving, the usually unsubstantiated assertions of racist thinkers.    Basic to these undertakings was his conviction that human behavior, for the    most part, was learned rather than inherent in our biology. This aspect of Boas'    program, that was to be a central feature of his anthropological legacy, was    made explicit in the work of his students, specifically Margaret Mead.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mead first met    Boas when she was an undergraduate at Barnard College. She pursued graduate    studies under his direction at Columbia University because, as she wrote in    1949, he "and Ruth Benedict had presented the tasks of anthropology as more    urgent than any other task which lay ready to the choice of a student of human    behavior." When she went to Samoa<a name="volta7"></a><a href="#nota7"><SUP>7</SUP></a>,    in 1924 at the age of 23, she acknowledged her debt to Boas, not only for her    training, but also for inspiring and directing her in framing her research problem.    The questions she asked were: "Are the disturbances which vex our adolescents    due to the nature of adolescence itself or to the civilization? Under different    conditions does adolescence present a different picture?" (Mead, 1928) Underlying    these questions, and her research, was the much larger issue that was central    to the theoretical framework being developed by Boas: To what extent does human    behavior derive from biological heritage as against social (cultural) environment?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>Coming of Age    in Samoa</I> (1928), published shortly after Mead defended her doctoral dissertation,    caused a sensation. At one level the book presented a fascinating account of    female adolescence in American Samoa; but, at another, it was both a critique    of prevailing theories of adolescence advanced by scholars and accepted by professionals    and a framework for rethinking the theories and changing practices.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The argument was    simple but with devastating implications. Adolescence in the United States,    at the time of the study, was believed to be a period of stress and strain.    Public opinion was focused on the subject because of the publicity given the    activities of some young women during the "roaring twenties." If Mead could    show that this was not the case in Samoa, it would prove that the difficulties    were <I>not</I> inherent in any inevitable human nature, but were instead the    result of the particular forms of child rearing to which American adolescents    were exposed. If this were the case, we could change our child rearing practices    to mitigate and perhaps even eliminate the difficulties of adolescence, especially    as experienced by females.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several implications    of the study for the future of anthropology and its place both in the social    sciences and in public thinking and policy formulation must be made explicit.    First, what Mead accomplished was to establish in both public understanding    and in scientific thought, was that other cultures could be used as a database    against which general statements about assumed universal human characteristics    and behaviors made exclusively on the basis of observations in the West could    be tested. That is, if generalizations made by theoreticians about adolescent    girls in the name of science could be shown <I>not</I> to occur in Samoa - or    any other culture - this would disprove (falsify) the proposition that it was    rooted in our (biological) humanity. Second, if Samoan adolescents behaved differently    from their North American counterparts it could only be because the behavior    (of adolescence) was learned and Samoans had been exposed to different experiences    than Americans. If this were so, it followed that adolescent behavior could    be changed by modifying the circumstances to which children were exposed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here was the truly    revolutionary social and political potential of Boas' anthropological paradigm.    Human beings were in control of their own behavior. If they did not like something    in their culture, they could change it.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><I>The Coming of    Age in Samoa</I>, according the Mead, was not written as a "popular" book. It    also was not a technical monograph intended for an audience of professional    anthropologists or other scholars. Instead, it was a book written in simple    and straightforward language "that would be communicative to those who had the    most to do with adolescents - teachers, parents and soon-to-be parents," asking    them to rethink what they were doing in the light of her report. This idea of    transforming behaviors considered to be unwanted or undesirable by modifying    other behavior was tremendously empowering. It gave people the ability to transform    their lives and their futures.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If Boas, Mead,    and an anthropology based the concept of culture as learned behavior that differed    from group to group and place to place and was susceptible to being changed    were right, people no longer were bound to accept as inevitable social forms    received from previous generations. They could change them by changing themselves    and what they did. They no longer needed leaders or reformers. They, themselves,    could provide the direction.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This was the kind    of scientific thinking with which it would be possible to build a more rational,    liberal and democratic world. Furthermore, instead of assuming that the traditions    of the West, its economic practices, family and kinship patterns, religions    and rituals, etc., were the inevitable end point of human evolution and debating    who would be permitted to participate in them and to what degree, a new culture    could be developed by combining selections from among what was known (and invented)    in the West with practices from the range of other cultures being studied. The    ethnographic record, as being assembled from the investigations of specific    cultures by anthropologists, could be gleaned to find out what in human experience    worked and what should be avoided (Boas, 1928; Kluckhohn, 1957). If culture    was learned rather than innate, and based on one's membership in a group or    category, all peoples, no matter their place of birth or upbringing, could participate    fully and equally as individuals by learning the new practices. It was never    that human behavior could be explained as something determined solely by culture.    Rather, before one dare conclude that some specific human activity is universal,    based on an untested assumption or studies conducted only in European societies    - not to speak of slime molds or laboratory animals as is being done by the    present generation of evolutionist scientists - it was necessary to compile    data on variations in different cultural settings: only thus could one hope    to clarify what was a result of cultural conditioning and what was biology.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">America's entry    into World War II drastically changed the focus of national concern and with    it the framework of political debate. To mobilize for the war effort it was    necessary to unify the population that here-to-fore had been kept apart by the    separatist ideology that dominated public debate. The integrationist premises    of the anthropological science of Boas, Mead and others were more supportive    of the need to bring together all members of the national society behind the    war effort than its predecessor and alternative. As Karen Brodkin put it in    her discussion of the sudden American acceptance of the descendants of European    immigrants, "The war against fascism led to a more inclusive version of whiteness."    "Instead of dirty and dangerous races that would destroy American democracy,    immigrants became ethnic groups whose children had successfully assimilated    into the mainstream&#133;" (Brodkin, 1998, p. 36). Under the guidance of this    new liberal philosophy that supported the incorporation of its "white" citizens    as individuals, America succeeded not only in winning the war, but also in emerging    from it as the most powerful nation in the world.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the post war    period the American economy grew rapidly and its society was transformed. With    the help of the GI Bill, the sons of once disparaged immigrants went to college    and earned degrees that qualified them for jobs in the rapidly growing industries    that eventually would become multinational. Aided by FHA and VA mortgages they    bought homes in the suburbs where they and their children achieved a degree    of assimilation that the earlier political policies based on the separatist    philosophy had denied to their parents.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Programs to rebuild    the economies and societies of our allies, and of our European and Japanese    adversaries, and beginning a decade later to help develop and "modernize" the    new nations emerging from a discredited colonialism, also were guided by the    new liberal philosophy that was based on the premise that human behavior and    the institutions of society were learned and not rooted in a nature. In the    period from the onset of World War II through perhaps the end of the Vietnam    War and the height of the Civil Rights movement, a liberal political imagery,    based in considerable part on the anthropological view of the world, dominated    public thinking in America. It was central in debate and formulation of public    policy. Mead became an American icon. Anthropology was accepted as one of the    basic social sciences and programs and departments proliferated as part of the    rapid growth of universities. The growing number of professional anthropologists,    assuming the battle over racism and social acceptance of all citizens had been    won, turned their attention away from public debates and social policy issues    and devoted their efforts to elaborating the scholarly and academic aspects    of the disciplinary agenda.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the twenty-first    century opens, this view of the world many anthropologists came to take for    granted is being challenged, within the academy by proponents in fields with    names such as sociobiology, evolutionary psychology and molecular biology, and,    perhaps more importantly, in civic discourse. Those advocating these new reductionist    theories, which are based on the same evolutionary imagery that informed last    century's separatist, discriminatory political agendas, point to anthropology    as the basis for what people otherwise as diverse in their academic backgrounds    and areas of specialization as Edward O. Wilson (1999, p. 200-201) and Steven    Pinker (1994, p. 404-412) call the "Standard Social Science Model". They erroneously    claim that anthropology attributes the full explanation for all human behavior    to learning, culture, or what they oversimplify as environment<a name="volta8"></a><a href="#nota8"><SUP>8</SUP></a>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authors of    the many books and papers advocating the new evolutionary reductionisms are    neither racists nor eugenicists, but their as yet unsubstantiated claims that    human behavior is to be explained exclusively by means of our genes<a name="volta9"></a><a href="#nota9"><SUP>9</SUP></a>,    support conservative views of social reality that rationalize the status quo    (with all of its institutionalized racism and other discriminatory practices)    and promote it as inevitable. If our genes alone account for our behavior, it    follows that there is nothing much we can do about it other than to acknowledge    the social consequences of the world in which we find ourselves and then learn    to live with it<a name="volta10"></a><a href="#nota10"><SUP>10</SUP></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nelkin and Lindee    (1995, p. 100) summarize the implications of the new reductionism for civic    discourse and social policy making in words that echo the Calvinist idea of    for-ordination. They write:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <blockquote>          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The appropriation        of DNA - the good or bad gene - to explain individual differences recasts        common beliefs about the importance of heredity in powerful scientific terms.        Science becomes a way to empower prevailing beliefs, justifying existing        social categories and expectations as based on natural forces. The great,        the famous, the rich and successful, are what they are because of their        genes. So too, the deviant and the dysfunctional are genetically fated.        Opportunity is less important than predisposition. Some are destined for        success, others for problems or, at least, a lesser fate.</font></p>   </blockquote> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If our genes do    determine our fate, why should society's resources be expended to educate new    immigrants and other minorities doomed to failure? If "criminal" behavior is    programmed in their genes, why make the effort to rehabilitate young, black,    male offenders? Or, for that matter, why even think about public policy as a    means to improve the human condition?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is much more    involved in the nature/nurture debate than an abstract theoretical disagreement    among dispassionate scientists. Each side of what continues to be framed in    terms of an uncompromising opposition - in spite of repeated denials on both    sides - leads logically to significantly different views of the social order.    Since neither side is able at present to muster a sufficient combination of    theory and data to convince the other, the debate will continue well into the    future. In the meantime, I suggest that we consider the public policy implications    of both positions, which brings me back to the criticism that Franz Boas' anthropology    was more of a social and political agenda than a science. I have argued that    in some respects it was; that Boas' anthropology was formulated as the science    to counter the prevailing one that, among other things, justified social exclusion,    discrimination and prejudice. Today's neoevolutionary, reductionist theories,    whether their proponents intend it or not, once more provide "scientific" support    for conservative, separatist and often discriminatory social policies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The more relevant    debate is to be found in the realm of politics. In the absence of conclusive    proof, why should concerned citizens opt for a position that implies that their    social world is the product of forces over which they have no control? Why should    they accept that the institutions, rules and practices to be found in the West    are inevitable? Would it not be wiser for them to choose the position that leads    to the belief that they are the masters of their own destinies? Perhaps it is    time for those who believe, as did Boas, Mead and several generations of anthropologists,    that human beings are able to invent and implement cultural forms other than    those presently found in the West, to raise their voices once more in public    debates on social issues where the contest over the discourse that is to inform    public policy is being waged.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although anthropological    thinking, its research activities and methodological approaches, have been criticized,    both appropriately and not, and have changed in the past half-century, it is    now time to reaffirm in public the basic view of the world the discipline continues    to teach: that human beings are not simply the products of their genes - mean,    selfish or other. With respect to their social, political, economic and other    behaviors, they are able to invent and implement practices different from those    that dominate our present Euro-American world. It is time for anthropologists    to revive their concern with social policy and make it once again central. The    result can be, in the spirit of what Carroll said in the epigraph to this paper    - and Boas and Mead believed - that the future will be different because we    did what was necessary to make the present different.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     ]]></body>

<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="nota1"></a><a href="#volta1">1</a>    The inspiration to write this paper emerged while I was planning a conference    commemorating the centenary of Margaret Mead with Professor Morton Klass. We    intended to examine the "scientific" claims of sociobiology, evolutionary psychology    and other forms of NeoDarwinian reductionism that attribute human behavior exclusively    to genetic factors and to explore their implications for public policy. Due    to Dr. Klass' sudden death in April 2001, the conference was put on hold.    <br>   Morton Klass and I were fellow students at Columbia University in the mid-1950s,    more than a decade after the death of Franz Boas. At the time Boas' legacy already    was under attack by those wishing to make the discipline more scientific. We    both did study with Margaret Mead among others influenced by Boas.    <br>   This paper is dedicated to my friend and colleague Morton Klass who both professionally    and personally embodied the values attributed in the paper to Boas, Mead and    others at Columbia University and also helped make anthropology more scientific    by clarifying the concept of culture through doing the kind of ethnographic    fieldwork its understanding requires.    <br>   <a name="nota2"></a><a href="#volta2">2</a> This statement must be modified    to acknowledge the role of Jews as the ever-present "other" in the Christian    religious tradition that grew out of the rubble of the disintegration of the    Roman Empire to dominate European belief and thinking up to the present (Carroll,    2001). Although the earliest Christians were similar to the Jews biologically,    the Europeans to adopt the faith later - who were different - used the physical    features that differentiated the groups as distinguishing negative makers. The    Africans, Asians and peoples of the Western Hemisphere discovered during the    expansion differed even more in terms of their looks and behaviors.    <br>   <a name="nota3"></a><a href="#volta3">3</a>    The explanations, of course, would have to support the continuing dominance    of the others by the governments of the nations of Europe.    <br>   <a name="nota4"></a><a href="#volta4">4</a> What must the world be like for    man to know it? (Kuhn, 1970).    <br>   <a name="nota5"></a><a href="#volta5">5</a> The Linnaean system was intended    to classify all forms of life. It had unanticipated consequences when applied    in terms of the framework of the metaphor of developmental stages to human populations.    <br>   <a name="nota6"></a><a href="#volta6">6</a> Their heroes, as Lewis (in press)    notes, included Kant, Herder, Goethe, Schiller, Lessing, Moses Mendelssohn,    Beethoven and the Von Humbolt brothers.    <br>   <a name="nota7"></a><a href="#volta7">7</a> Samoa at the time only recently    had become a US possession that had been brought to public attention in the    press and in a film by ethnographic filmmaker Robert Flaherty.    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<br>   <a name="nota8"></a><a href="#volta8">8</a> These scholars do not use the word    culture, nor do they acknowledge and make reference to the database of cross-cultural    materials collected by anthropologists that would falsify many of their claims.    In fact, they appear to be referring more to the behaviorism of B. F. Skinner    and his followers in psychology than to the thinking and research results of    anthropology.    <br>   <a name="nota9"></a><a href="#volta9">9</a> This position has been followed    by most molecular biologists, evolutionary psychologists and sociobiologists    since Francis Crick's (1957) first formulated the "dogma" of DNA&#151;&gt;RNA&#151;&gt;    protein, attributing ontological priority exclusively to the genes.    <br>   <a name="nota10"></a><a href="#volta10">10</a> A startling example of this was    the recent review in the Sunday New York Times Book Review Section of <I>Mean    Genes</I> by Burnham and Phelan, a book in which the authors, according to the    reviewer, after accepting the argument for the power of genes to explain human    behavior, offer "practical steps for better living" &#91;a self help book to    deal with the inevitable consequences of genetic determinism&#93;. Although    the book was dismissed intellectually, the fact that the editors of the Times    chose to review it demonstrates the influence this line of thinking has in popular    literary circles.</font></p>      ]]></body><back>

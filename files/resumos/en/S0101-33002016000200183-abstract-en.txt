ABSTRACT The article schematically reconstructs the process that led to the political crisis resulting in the impeachment of Fernando Collor de Mello in 1992. The author argues in favor of an analytical perspective that focuses on the very process of crisis, rather than trying to explain their results by factors which they had correlation, as is making the recent literature on interruption of presidential terms in Latin America.

In this text, I present some points situated in the crossing between theoretical and conceptual fields that include some relevant discussions on contemporary culture. Relations between body, memory and future are addressed from the concepts of performance, ritual and play. The analyses refer to the movie Itão kuegü: as hiper mulheres (2011), de Takumã Kuikuro, Carlos Fausto and Leonardo Sette, and consider the circumstances in wich it has been made, the filmic narrative and the presence of women, who are the protagonists of the film.

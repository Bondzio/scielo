Abstract The metropolis of SÃ£o Paulo, from its global city position, concentrates transnational processes, among which migration - at present, it is estimated that over 370 thousand immigrants officially reside in the city. In this context, the interface between human mobility and global health broadens out, since both migration policies and their absence have a meaningful impact on migrants' health. The present paper addresses the challenges the arrival and permanence of the migrant population represent to the healthcare municipal sphere, as well as the recent initiatives from the municipal public authority to conceive efficient public policies towards this population. By applying qualitative methodology, the research has had interviews, document search, and literature review as sources.

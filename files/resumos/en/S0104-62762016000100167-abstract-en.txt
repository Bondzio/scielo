Abstract This article presents a critical dialogue with the literature about deliberative systems. It features an innovative proposal to investigate deliberative arenas in their connections with other parts of the political system and society. It adopts a method present in the field of Social Network Analysis (SNA) to conduct an empirical investigation of public policy councils of the city of Belo Horizonte. Our working hypothesis was that the main links among the councils would be informal mechanisms that promotes institutional interaction. The results show that government councillors are part of various councils simultaneously, so they play the role of links between the practices and institutions in which they work. It suggests the necessity to carry out future studies that would be able to show the connection of councils to the other parts of the broader deliberative system.

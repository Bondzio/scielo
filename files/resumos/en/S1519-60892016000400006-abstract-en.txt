Abstract Violent crime, particularly homicide, have sharply increased since the 1990Â´s and exponentially since 1998, as a leftist government was established in Venezuela. Scholar explanations within the country mostly rely on inequality, strain, deprivation, drug markets and even impunity as main associated factors, although government successfully reduced inequality, especially since 2005, while the crime rate soared, and promoted a police reform aimed to foster professionalism and moderate use of force. This contradiction is discussed in the context of an inconclusive police reform, a lack of control of firearms and increased intervention of the military in public safety issues, which probably have contributed to situational violence beyond policies for reduction of social inequality.

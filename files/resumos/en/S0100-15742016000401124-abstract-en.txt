Abstract This article aims to analyze the curriculum of a specific public school, in particular the aspects related to the inclusion of disabled students within the school's space and in collective situations of continuous training developed at the school. The research, based on a collaborative-critical action-research in the context of basic education with 26 teachers and one interpreter of Brazilian Sign Language - Libras -, reveals the prevalence of homogenizing standards, as shown by the typical example of placing all students with disabilities in the same regular classes, as well as the need for a formative space for school teachers. Mainly, the curriculum studies bring the opportunity to (re)discuss school inclusion without disarticulation of the macro context of education.

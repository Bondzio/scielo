Starting from the recognition of the globalized world's complex condition and the need of a holistic consideration of its interconnected phenomena, this paper will present a defense of the complex perspective of the female sexuality, including the suggestion and defense of erotic holism as a possible source of proposals and solutions for the dilemmas posed by the 'global era'. The problematization of female sexuality and eroticism from the holistic paradigm of complexity will be a pretext for the consideration of the current global problems through a different and multidisciplinary perspective, by pointing out existing reductionist mono-explanatory paradigms.

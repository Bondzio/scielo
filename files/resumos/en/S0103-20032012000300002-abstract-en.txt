This paper aims to understand how the structures of governance, settled by strategic resources, may affect responsiveness to environmental laws, the relations of producers and processors, in distilleries of Paraná. From a complementary perspective of Transaction Costs Economics (TCE) and Resource Based View (RBV) approaches, a qualitative and descriptive research, with cross-sectional and longitudinal perspective, was conducted. The study involved semi-structured interviews with five managers and agricultural producers engaged in distilleries located in Paraná state. Results indicated partnership in the lease form as the most appropriate to optimize the responsiveness to environmental laws, because of the total control obtained regarding the manufacturing process. The farming partnership and supply contract may require more time, because involves the coordination of the relationship of the distillery with its contractors. Complementarity between governance structures (TCE) and strategic resources (RBV), the focus of this study is ratified from the consideration that internal resources and capabilities of distilleries, such as location, distance, knowledge and others influence the choice of more vertically integrated governance structures. These, in turn, are chosen to explore, protect and obtain competitive advantage through the control over those resources.

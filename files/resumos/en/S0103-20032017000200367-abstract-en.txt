Abstract: This paper aims to measure the social and budgetary costs of the price guarantee policy for rice and corn in the period from 1986/87 to 2012/13. These years faced important changes in the mentioned policy and both products have been systematically afforded by this policy. The paper develops mathematical models to calculate the social cost for three price guarantee policies (price subsidies, government purchases and price insurance) and the social costs were estimated only when the minimum price exceeds the market price. It was verified that PGPM policies were operationalized even when the minimum price was below the market price. Comparing social and budgetary costs during the above crop years for each ton of rice and corn, in general, it was found that the lowest social cost was for a price insurance program, followed by subsidy price programs and the highest social cost arises for the purchasing programs. The findings would help policy-makers when deciding what kind of price guarantee policy needs to be performed.

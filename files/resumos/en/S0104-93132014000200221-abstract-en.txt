The aim of this article is to reflect on the dynamics of the relationship between the herdsman Samuel Borges dos Santos and the managers of the National Park Grande Sertão Veredas. The background are the changes to land use that comprised the 'Gerais' in 'Sertão'. I argue that Samuel transposed the model of the relationship that he developed with his former employer to his relationship with the managers of the park while he waited for the indemnification of his property. As a form of resistance, understood here as a "weapon of the weak", the herdsman acted in this way for 21 years in order to remain in the land in the face of the determinations of environmental legislation.

In the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st century, a new geological epoch emerged: the Anthropocene. In this new epoch, the environmental stability is lost due to the human interference and the impact of economic development upon the environment. Such is an unprecedented change in human experience and needs to be mitigated in order to allow a safer human existence. Mitigation requires a lot more intense international cooperation than the one observed in the international regime on climate change. Alliances between key countries for the resolution of the decarbonization problem are crucial. They might be obtained if new interpretations of threat, security, and national interest are accepted along with a revision of the conception of sovereignty in which common global interests of the humanity are incorporated. What it is about is a complex change, but a change that will update important foundations of a geopolitics able to deal with the questions put forward by the 21st century.

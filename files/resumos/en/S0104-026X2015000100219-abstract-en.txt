This paper concerns the analysis of a set of artworks in which gender issues are identified. It aims to investigate how it is possible to interprete discomforts of gender in the aesthetic manifestations through the variable domesticity. Methodologically, the analysis is based on the concepts of iconography and iconology (Erwin PANOFSKY, 1987), which are enriched by the contributions of gender studies, in order to provide theoretical tools that help to uncover the intrinsic meanings of the works, in productions of women artists. Using interviews with the authors, we incorporate to the analysis personal considerations and subjective indicators obtained from such exchanges. In the context of a line of research on works of art produced in the Northeast Region of Argentina, this paper seeks to highlight noncanonical modes of contemporary art production of female artists that are significant in their modes of exposing issues of the social reality in the contemporary culture. "La Cruz de los Milagros", by Fernanda Toccalino and "La condici&#243;n femenina" by Maria Victoria Gonzalez are works in which the presence of political positions on domestic work and the construction of femininity is evident in the aesthetic creation.

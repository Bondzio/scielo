Abstract The present essay addresses the three major conditions for the emergence of a world health notion, with special reference to Africa: (i) the pandemic risk and other common sanitary issues; (ii) the institutional evolution in health development aid; and (iii) the genealogy of a common definition for world health. This text discusses the potential risks for the poorest populations in the world brought about by the globalization temptation, which follows the notion of "global health," still and ever at the most fragile, the poorest, the sickest and least privileged people's expense: women and children. States and international interstate institutions have seen their public service mission being confiscated, running the risk of undermining sovereignty, security and national and international peace that North American private and public institutions allegedly aimed to protect.

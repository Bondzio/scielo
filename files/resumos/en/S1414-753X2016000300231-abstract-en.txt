Abstract Since ECO-92, environmental organizations and social movements have been networking with the support of information and communication technologies, in order to strengthen their capacity to influence decision-making processes relating to the causes they fight for. Some of these networks have been organized around the six Brazilian official biomes and have been incorporating the resources available on the Internet to achieve greater public visibility, capillarity and communicative effectiveness on their strategic actions. However, not all of them have been able to remain updated, active and visible in the increasingly dynamic digital environment, despite its informational and political legacy. This paper presents a synthesis of a comparative research among the here called "biome-networks", based on data collection on its organizational structures and its informational and communicative resources used to achieve its strategic aims related to the eco-regions in which they operate.

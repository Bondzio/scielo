Evaluation initiatives directed at different levels of teaching were undertaken in Brazil, especially since the last decade of the 20th century, within a movement to redefine the role of the state in the management of educational policies. The outlines adopted, which fortify the mechanisms of discrimination, tend to provoke rigidity and standardization of school curricula. Focusing on initiatives by the federal government such as the implementation of the National System to Evaluate Primary Education - the Saeb -, the National High School Examination - the ENEM- and the National College Examination - the ENC -, this text highlights their major features and, in the case of the examinations, notes their potential to condition the curricula, thus intensifying both educational and social inequalities.

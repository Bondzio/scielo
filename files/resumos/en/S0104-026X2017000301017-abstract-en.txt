Abstract: This paper aims to think about the following questions: where are the spaces for black women in the prevailing narratives regarding women&#8217;s movements and feminists movements in Brazil? To what extent do the theoretic limits and the methodologic paths that compose the most part of the feminist historiography and the women&#8217;s struggle during the first half of the XX century in Brazil didn&#8217;t allow us, or were not enough to try to understand and to reflect the struggles of black women? And lastly, what is the history of the agenda and feminist claims? How is this history told?

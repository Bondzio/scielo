Abstract Among the advances in the 2030 Sustainable Development agenda is that the goal to achieve gender equality and empower women has nine specific targets. These focus on many of the root causes of gender inequality, including women&#8217;s unequal access to economic resources. This article focuses specifically on women&#8217;s unequal access to land and the set of proposed indicators to measure progress. Drawing on the available data for Latin America, it demonstrates the current degree of inequality in the gender distribution of landholders and landowners, and why it is important that countries improve their gender statistics, collecting gender disaggregated data on both land ownership and agricultural decision-making.

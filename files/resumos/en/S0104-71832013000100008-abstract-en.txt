The article explores how the ambulant vending circuit of one of the train lines of Buenos Aires is structure and the ways in which vendors present themselves as workers. The article discusses the notions that vendors use to position and justify the performance of the activity. The article advances on the ways in which actors create and maintain relationships and reciprocal obligations that exceed the economic sphere. These relations are those that enable the development of the activity and settle agents on the working circuits. As I believe that practices, feelings, morality, discourses, behaviors shape the working process, the article investigates working activities not only at the level of the relations of production but also in the way these processes are experienced by people of flesh and blood.

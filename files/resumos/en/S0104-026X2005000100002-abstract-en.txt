Through this article, Scott sets up a discussion about the concepts of equality and difference, gender, individual identity and group identity, emphasizing that this theme needs to be historicized in contemporary society. This article draws attention to questions that envolve affirmative action policies, gender and race differences in the labour world or minorities' access to universities. Scott argues that the equality question must be understood in terms of paradox.

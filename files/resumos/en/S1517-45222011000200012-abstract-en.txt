In a context where the collective frameworks that structure people's social and individual identities have been deinstitutionalizing, we are compelled to rethink them within the framework of the new processes of socialization, in which labor, as traditionally understood, is no longer the central axis. New social spaces are created for such identity construction to take place. Within such spaces, the social policy, by means of its symbolical power derived from the power of the State to establish classifications, defines the social identities by conditioning the daily practices of social actors. Women internalize their stay in social programs, ascribing a particular meaning to it. In this perspective, this work presents a typology that is set with basis on the relative distance separating women who are 'beneficiaries' of employment programs from the prospects to build their own autonomy. It aims at contributing to challenge the social actions from a gender perspective, while more or less enabling of changes in the subjective repertoires of women and of a different (or not) way of doing things and seeing themselves and their future. The work used a qualitative approach for building the typology that was based on the analysis of female either explicit or implicit representations and social imaginaries. This methodology has the peculiarity of capturing the social actor's internal perspective by using a language of concepts (Glasser & Strauss, 1967, Denzin & Lincoln, 1994).

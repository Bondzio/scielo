Abstract: This article discusses the dilemmas of interdisciplinary approach between anthropology and education, from two important perspectives: ethnography and youth cultural practices. It discusses how ethnography is a controversial point of dialogue. It also conducts the essential and classic discussion about the notions of youth and stages of life, which has provided a very fruitful debate, by means of researches that are between anthropology and education. It concludes, therefore, that anthropology can contribute for the public debate on education and differences in the contemporary world. However, in order for this to happen, it&#8217;s necessary a broader anthropological approach of educational and school context.

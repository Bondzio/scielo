ABSTRACT This paper estimates ideal points for the Brazilian Supremo Tribunal Federal justices between 2012 and 2017. In this period, the level of dissensus decreased and shows no association with political party cleavages. On one hand, these results help to qualify the &#8220;eleven islands&#8221; hypothesis. On the other hand, they challenge the explanatory power of the attitudinal model when applied outside the United States conditions.

The ethnographic narrative experiences articulating images and texts may trigger the sensitivities, knowledge and esthetical and cultural senses existing in the see-what-is-said/say-what-is-seen relation. The photographs are among the possibilities of exploration of the universe of images. From the images taken from the daily lives of the transvestites, I argue that the posing is a signifying component capable of offering hints for the comprehension/ interpretation of some particular aspects of that universe, not based only on the usual interpretations of the written words. For this article, I gathered fragments of the transvestites' migration to Italy, a project significantly marked by the expectation of working and making a living, but which is also immerse in glamour in a scenario where the images - photographs sent to the families and also made available in the virtual platform - compose narratives of a success inscribed on the body, through jewelry, cars, but also anchored in differentiated geographical spaces, capable of informing about the "conquest of Europe".

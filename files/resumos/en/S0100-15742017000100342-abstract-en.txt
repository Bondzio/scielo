ABSTRACT This article presents the results of a research that explored the school experiences of Mapuche people, specifically as regards their significance for taught history in their schooling process. The socio-educational research was developed within a historical framework, employing archival review as an information-producing technique, and content analysis as a procedure to reduce and categorize the relevant information. Results show grievance and discrimination episodes in taught history, as well as expressions of resistance to the discursive constructions of the latter. These are all manifestations that cast light on the strategic role of history as a school subject, in the schooling process, to build hegemony/subalternization in the Mapuche/non-Mapuche interethnic context.

abstract This article analyzes the recent dynamics of agricultural employment in Brazil. We initially discuss several structural factors that affect farm labor, focusing on the changes that have taken place in the agricultural sector over the last decades and in the demographic dynamics of rural areas. We then analyze various secondary sources of information on the evolution of strictly agricultural jobs. The paper's main conclusion is that the share of agricultural jobs in Brazil's overall labor market has decreased and that this occurred in a positive employment scenario, i.e., when all other economic sectors enjoyed increasing employment levels.

Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate a collaborative distance consulting service - CDCS - in assistive technology - AT- for teachers using qualitative exploratory approach. The participants were six teachers of students with cerebral palsy - CP - and three consultants in AT. A virtual learning environment was built to provide consultancy and to collect data obtained in the form of responses to questionnaires for consultants and teachers. The data were processed by content analysis. The evidence indicates that the CDCS proved to be beneficial to the performance of consultants and teachers as well as students with CP. This research contribution is to present another possibility of service in support of inclusive school.

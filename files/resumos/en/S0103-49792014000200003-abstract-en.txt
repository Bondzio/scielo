This article presents a brief analysis of the Brazilian housing policy, using as a case study the Social Rent Program, which was created in the city of São Paulo in 2002. São Paulo's Social Rent Program is the main rent-based housing program implemented in Brazil recently. Created by Resolution 23 of the Municipal Housing Fund Council, it sought to meet the demand of families whose income was up to three minimum wages, which until then had excluded them from existing housing funding programs. After 10 years of implementation, the main limitations found are a lack of social guidance for the demand covered and a lack of guidance in the management of common areas. Another unsolved social rent issue is the maximum period of permanence of families in the rented properties, as well as managing a demand that is much larger than the program's capacity.

abstract In Brazil, most precarious jobs are performed by blacks and by women. Despite the good performance of the labor market until 2013, great disparities remained between blacks and whites, as well as between men and women. Because the effects of the current economic crisis on the labor market penalize above all the most vulnerable segments, this article aims to verify whether the issue of race and gender contributes to the reproduction of precariousness. It may be inferred that a consistent strategy to reduce such inequalities requires a combination of policies to, on the one hand, create jobs, shrink the informal economy and increase income, and on the other, to promote racial and gender equality in the labor market.

This paper discusses the social implications of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) on labor, from the perspective of gender. As part of a survey carried out by CEPAL in three Latin American countries, including Brazil, it is based on a case study conducted in a factory of the electronics sector in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas. The study's findings indicate that, as pointed out in previous analyses, female labor has not improved with the introduction of new technologies.

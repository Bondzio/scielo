Abstract Marriage migration is a gendered phenomenon shaped by States policies that may encourage, control, or prohibit it. Female marriage migrants (in particular from Third World countries) face growing difficulties to reunite with their fianc√©s/husbands, due to restrictive migration policies implemented in both sending and receiving countries. Based on a fieldwork on Filipino marriage migrants, the paper describes, in the context of a globalized marriage market, the global policing of female marriage migrants and how their marriages are expected to be romantic and female marriage migrants to perform love.

Abstract: The Uruguayan borderline with Brazil has historically been identified as a region with the worst socioeconomic indicators of the country. On the other side, Uruguayan borderline with Brazil is a bilingual region, with a categorized situation of diglossia from the earliest linguistic studies. This makes us wonder if differences on educational results are related with the use of &#8220;portuñol&#8221; on behalf of the Uruguayan borderline students. The aim of this research is to analyze the isolated effect of being a &#8220;portuñol&#8221; speaker and live in the borderline, over a standard model of educational inequality (social class, gender, type of educational institution). In order to achieve this we generated a Hierarchical Linear Model in two levels: students and schools, adding to the classical educational determinants linguistic factors, using microdata of Pisa 2009. The results allow us to confirm the hypothesis of a linguistic inequality on an individual level.

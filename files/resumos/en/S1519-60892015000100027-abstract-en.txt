Abstract: This paper aims to present and discuss the discourses and practices that seek to organize, explain and intervene in the involvement of adolescents with the urban crime. The paper analyses the use of poverty as a key category to explain this involvement. In addition, it identifies the reinterpretations of that category throughout the twentieth century, until the current relation between poverty and guarantee of rights, proposed in the Estatuto da Crian√ßa e do Adolescente (Statute of Children and Adolescents).

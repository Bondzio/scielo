This paper departs from the context of global intellectual policy, treaties and legal order that regulate, among other things, the flow of information on the internet. By means of a thick description of deadlocks, disputes and strategies regarding the web regulation, we try to understand how the global policy overarching framework that regulates the privacy of internet exchanges and the network governance works. Such a policy framework has direct impact on the uses of and within digital means and technologies. Within the more general context of global policy production, this study focuses specifically on the Brazilian and North American internet regulation, aiming to grasp the underlying rationality of this system of production of rules that affects the internet and/or digital social networks, taken here as a public good.

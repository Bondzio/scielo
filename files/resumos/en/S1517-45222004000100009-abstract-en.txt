This article will try to study the broad influence and power maintained by large landowners and their associations since over a century ago in Uruguay. Based on the analysis of the symbolic dimensions of the agrarian world, we will study discursive practices of Cattle Owners Associations - Asociación Rural del Uruguay and Federación Rural - as a core part of their symbolic strategy to keep their hegemony within the agrarian social field. Therefore, we believe that the social construction of our country's territory is based on the form of perception imposed by that group's symbolic power, which made its particular forms of land appropriation and use into the only possible and legitimate way to use natural resources. In order to examine discursive practices, we start from the assumption that social, associational and corporate organization are always immersed in symbolic struggles, since the objective achievement of their long-term interests is always at stake within themselves. In Merton's terms, we could say that, besides an organization's manifest function - associational, commercial, professional - there is always a latent one that seeks to impose on its opponents and the public opinion the typical worldview of the group it represents. As a result, we can find those agents' power, alliances, conflicts clearly expressed in the their discursive practices, thus allowing us to access the understanding of their symbolic strategic of social reproduction.

The term gender has become the feminist shorthand, in the 1970s, to signal the cultural construction rather than biological basis of women's unequal treatment and domination by men. In the past three decades the term has become as ubiquitous as ambiguous in feminist theorizing but, surprisingly, there is no semantic history of the origins, changing approaches and meanings of the concept. In this article I show that US sexologists and psychologists introduced gender in the 1950s in their endeavour to distinguish anatomical sex from social gender. This biomedical construction of gender is relevant for the epistemological difficulties in feminist theory with the link between gender and sex. In this article I address three related issues: 1) the habit among feminist scholars to explicitly or implicitly root gender in sex differences, 2) the heterosexual dualism that characterized the original medical notion of social gender and persists in much feminist theorizing until the late 1980s, and 3) the unquestioned cartesian dichotomy between nature and culture that runs like a red thread through the controversy over sex and gender. The article is inevitably open-ended. As I suggest, developments in biotechnology may open new vistas on what is the fundamental anthropological dilemma, namely, how to reconcile culture with nature.

This article intends to analyze the book Italianos no mundo rural paulista, by Jo√£o Baptista Borges Pereira (1974), one of the earliest Brazilian ethnographic international migration researches, based on the acculturation theory, in order to corroborate its contribution to the feminist ethnography. We focus on the use of gender as a central category on the international migration studies, thus empowering the Feminist Ethnography.

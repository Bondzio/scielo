The aim of this paper is to investigate the development and implementation of public security policies from a gender perspective, carried out by the Ministry of Justice and Security of the Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina), in the first decade of the century. I have analyzed the strategies used, as well the interaction between several agents, intended to build on gender definitions and gender policies and to institute actions against family violence complaints. In the study I observe on the one hand that, conceptually, gender policies arouse many meanings; and, on the other hand, I show that the actors who intervene in the execution of such policies are themselves somewhat cautious. The analysis of these policies in a Police Station for Women and the Family in one locality indicated that the implementation of such policies depend on the actors involved.

AbstractFollowing Boas, many anthropologists keep considering that learning processes are outside their discipline and fearing that cognitivism is currently using this thema as a tool for annexing anthropology to nativist psychology. After showing that the Chomskyan model internalizes contradictorily the scholar scheme of written grammar and, by reducing learning to a mere &#8220;awakening&#8221; of internal representations, is actually denying any relevance to actual learning activities, this article focused on two representing graphic activities are through learning processes: writing and drawing. It occurred historically that writing has been systematically transmitted violently by &#8220;dressage&#8221; (&#8220;taming&#8221; or &#8220;breaking in&#8221;) and that drawing can be forbidden but not taught in this way for the reason that it is a globally autonomous way of being, as all true learnings are. Drawing is always more than a mental representation since interaction with the actual presence of its&#8217; own products is constantly needed.

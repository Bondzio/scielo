This paper discusses the games of conflict and cooperation between Aracruz Celulose, a pulp company located in Southeast Brazil, and the Tupiniquim e Guarani Indian groups. It addresses the way Aracruz constructs its social and environmental corporate strategies aiming to achieve legitimacy in the local and regional contexts. The authors analyze the political and institutional dimensions of the strategies adopted by that company to deal with its main environmental and social issues. In order to do so, they used a theoretical framework based in a sociological approach to understand the "logiques dÂ´actions" of organizational actors.

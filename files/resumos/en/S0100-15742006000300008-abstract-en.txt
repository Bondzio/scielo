This article analyses the validity, relevance and feasibility of an undergraduate research topic in Education. It starts with a question - which criteria can we, advisors, use in judging a good research theme - in order to analyze ways and results expected in graduate and post-graduate thesis and dissertations. It emphasizes the process of constructing a theoretical-practical knowledge as much as for the student and the teacher-advisor. A case study approach is adopted and the data were collected through documental analysis, participant observation, recorded interview and telephone conversations. The conclusion is that in educational research it is necessary to formulate simple questions that are capable of relating the micro with the macro, the individual with the collective, the topic with the theme, science with life.

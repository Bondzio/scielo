ABSTRACT In this article Archeology will be used as a case study illustrating the discussion abouIn this article, Archeology will be used as a case study to illustrate the discussion about the different modes of Science and the different ontologies involved. We argue that Archeology is so interdisciplinary that it cannot be viewed in the same way as other disciplines of the Humanities, having its ontological, epistemological, theoretical and practical components more associated with Earth Sciences and Biology than with History or Anthropology. Finally, we present the structure of the scientific method in Archeology and how its characteristics point to a model of extreme interdisciplinarity, with few parallels in the other sciences.

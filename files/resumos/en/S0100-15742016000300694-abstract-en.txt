Abstract This paper is based on a review of the theories that discuss the social role of school, mainly regarding its objectives and how it handles conflict. We discuss research results conducted with students from high school, youth and adult education and higher education, as well as SÃ£o Paulo's public school teachers, about their perception of fairness and unfairness at school. We propose some articulations of the conflicts experienced in school and the development of conditions offensive to humanity. The experience of "fairness" would be related to the social recognition of the conditions of everyday life. Therefore, the narrative stops being centered around violence, as an abstract idea, which expresses itself as pathological bodies, to be understood as a public scene, centered around asocial context reified and experienced by subjects who, directly or indirectly, have their dignity degraded.

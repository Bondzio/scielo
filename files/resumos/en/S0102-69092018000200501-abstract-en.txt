This article discusses how Brazilian federalism sought to promote municipal state capacities in Lula&#8217;s government (2007-2010) through the territorial cooperation between such entities and the Union. It analyzes the Comitê de Articulação Federativa [Federative Articulation Committee], which was an innovation in the federative arrangement with the municipalities, but which results, with time, distanced themselves from their original purpose. Based on international literature and on the case study, it argues that intragovernmental relationships &#8211; when organized via federative forums without decision authority and intragovernmental enforcement resources &#8211; reduce its capacity to implement pact actions with other entities. This is a qualitative study (pathway case) supported by causal explanations of similar cases. It contributes with the literature on the subject by showing the limits of intragovernmental arenas based on territorial logic, emphasizing that national systems of public politics, present in a few areas, have been more effective in federative cooperation.

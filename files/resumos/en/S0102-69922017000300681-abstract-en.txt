Abstract Inserted in the field of the relationship between civil society and public security institutions, this article aims to measure and analyze the influence that certain types of variables (eg, sociodemographic features, criminal or institutional victimization experiences, contact with institutions, etc.) have on the assessment that the Brazilian population make about the quality of Military Police (MP) work. To do so, we use data produced by the National Victimization Survey (NVS), sample study conducted between 2010 and 2012 in all Brazilian states. In general, NVSÂ´s data indicate that, contrary to common sense, the fact of being a crime victim exerts relatively little influence on the perception that people have about the quality of Military Police work. The variables that had the greatest effect on the evaluation (positive or negative) about MP's work were those related to having been victim of violence or extortion practiced by the military itself, as well as the experiences of direct contact with the police. These findings reinforce the hypothesis (already well known in international literature) that positive or negative evaluations about police work are not exclusively and necessarily linked to the perception that such corporations are more or less effective in preventing crime, but to issues located only in institutional sphere of these organizations, such as the fight against violence and corruption perpetrated by the MPs and the improvement of its relationship with most vulnerable segments of the population.

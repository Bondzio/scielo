<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>1 <i>Introduction</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unlike the experience of many fields, the social    sciences<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><SUP>1</SUP></a> were not led to    the study of the environment through the gradual development of their major    paradigms – what Kuhn called "normal" or incremental science. On the    contrary, it was the irruption of serious environmental problems, and above    all, of socio-environmental movements and the social conflict embedded in these    movements, that placed the issue on social science agendas. While initial approaches    in the seventies tended to be ad hoc attempts to delimit the field of environmental    social science, the field today is thriving and diversified, with more clearly    defined research orientations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Although many social scientists thus came to    study the social determinants and consequences of environmental change, they    were even more unprepared to incorporate global changes in the scope of their    work. The problems of global warming and the rise in sea levels, in particular,    were remote from social science concerns, occurring on temporal and spatial    scales which their research paradigms did not contemplate. And unlike environmental    issues in general, global change did not at first generate socio-political movements    which commanded their attention. The early calls for social science involvement    came from physical scientists who clearly saw that human activity was responsible    for the acceleration of changes observed in world climate. It would be necessary    to engage social scientists in these efforts if current trends were to be modified.    The challenges of inter and multi-disciplinary research, always stretching the    vision – and often the patience – of "normal" scientists, are considerably    amplified when collaboration seeks to bridge the gap between natural and social    science.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These considerations are important for understanding    the development of what has come to be called the human dimensions of global    environmental change; the pace, institutional framework, geographical extent    and (relative) success of these developments; as well as the timid response    of Brazilian social science. Most importantly, they are essential for tracing    a strategy of promoting and supporting social science involvement in climate    research within the social science community.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>2 <i>International research on the human dimensions    of global environmental change</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Three related initiatives have been fundamental    in establishing the scientific agenda, promoting exchange and publishing and    disseminating results of human dimensions research. The Open Meeting of the    Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Research Community, as a venue    for these activities was first organized at Duke University in the United States,    in 1995, followed by meetings in Austria (1997), Japan (1999), Brazil (2001),    Canada (2003) and Germany (2005). While the Human Dimensions Program of the    International Social Science Council (launched in 1990) and, since 1996, the    International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change, with    support of several countries, have been active in the preparation of the Open    Meetings, each has been independently organized, with the election of a Steering    Committee at each meeting. This loose association of researchers, centers, national    and international agencies permitted the identification of a research community,    whose identity has consolidated over time. The second, more structured initiative    was the creation of the IHDP itself in 1996. Since the completion of its core    project on Land Use and Land Cover Change (co-sponsored with IGBP) in October    2005, the IHDP has six Core Science Projects:</font></p> <ul>       <li>          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Global Environmental Change and Human Security        (GECHS); </font></p>   </li>       <li>          ]]></body>

<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Vienna Open Meeting was the moment when competing    topics were sorted out, and LUCC and the first three of the above projects were    selected<a name="tx02"></a><a href="#nt02"><SUP>2</SUP></a>. Researchers who    participated in these projects first produced a Scoping Report for the IHDP    Scientific Committee; when approved, this was followed by a Science Plan, a    Scientific Steering Committee, the preparation of an Implementation Strategy,    and collaborative research. Successive Open Meetings, meanwhile, widened the    range of topics, some of which evolved as core projects.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The third related initiative was the participation    of the national academies of science. In many countries, the academies established    national committees and created formal lines of research support. Most of the    significant work on human dimensions has been the fruit of these activities<a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><SUP>3</SUP></a>.    Sixteen countries have created National Committees on Human Dimensions and another    16 have created Global Change Committees which integrate human dimensions into    the larger research community.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>3 <i>Brazilian human dimensions research</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The <I>Academia Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncias</I>    accompanied these moves, creating a Human Dimensions Committee in 1997. One    consequence of this decision was a bid by Brazil to hold the 4<SUP>th</SUP>    Open Meeting in Rio de Janeiro in 2001<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><SUP>4</SUP></a>.    The preparation and the implementation of this meeting was, without doubt, the    most significant activity of the Committee, and had as a major objective the    mobilization of the Brazilian Environmental Social Science community, increasing    interest and involvement in climate research. While this meeting coincided with    the creation of the National Association for Graduate Studies and Research in    Environment and Society (ANPPAS), which unites Graduate programs on society    and the environment and promotes well-attended national meetings on a biannual    basis, the Open Meeting did not significantly increase participation of Brazilians    in this field and global environmental change continues to be a little-explored    theme at Anppas meetings<a name="tx05"></a><a href="#nt05"><SUP>5</SUP></a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The reasons for this are important to consider    as calls for social science participation increase. The international experience    synthesized above makes it very clear that a pro-active role on the part of    funding agencies is fundamental. Research in this field will not take off on    its own, as, indeed, it has not done. Perhaps more important, however, has been    the lack of response of the environmental social science community itself. In    a country of such pressing environmental problems, long-neglected and still    without the necessary priority, immediate problems at the local, regional and    national level monopolize the attention of researchers and students<a name="tx06"></a><a href="#nt06"><SUP>6</SUP></a>.    In a field as new as environmental social science, graduate students and their    theses are a major source of new knowledge. The issues which inspire students    to seek out the 40 or so graduate programs in environmental sciences in Brazil    are those to which they have been exposed in their role as citizens. Global    climate change is not one of them.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Breaking this vicious circle of exclusive attention    to pressing local problems is an important objective for environmental social    sciences. In this respect, international experience is a useful guide. Four    core projects galvanized the nascent "human dimensions of global environmental    research community" for more than a decade. Such focusing was important    for two reasons. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, sub-communities of researchers were organized    into interdisciplinary, inter-institutional and international networks on themes    sufficiently few in number and limited in scope to be able to conduct comparative    research and synthesize results in fifteen years. Projects interested in this    exchange submitted their plans, which were accepted as part of the Scientific    Committee’s scope<a name="tx07"></a><a href="#nt07"><SUP>7</SUP></a>. The exchange    and visibility provided by the Open Meetings and publication and dissemination    of results by the IHDP created a space for this research which had been lacking    in conventional, disciplinary-oriented organizations. This collective effort,    potentialized by the network established by each core project, was fundamental    in forging effective programs, creating training possibilities and advancing    knowledge. This focusing favored cumulative results, which gave both visibility    and legitimacy to the field.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Secondly, the IHDP was realistic in the choice    of core projects, not identifying as central issues the Big Questions: What    are the human activities causing climate change and How do we stop them? Rather,    they took as starting points themes already the object of research, whose connection    to global change is not always self-evident, focusing on intermediate relations    rather than direct connections between human actions and climate change. The    four major issues are areas in which environmental social scientists had a tradition    of work but whose center of attention had not been climate change. Thus, land-use    and land-cover change had been studied in name of the loss of forest cover (to    monoculture, cattle-raising and lumbering) and its impact on traditional livelihoods    of small farmers and Indians; in the name of the demographic occupation of new    territories; and in the name of the loss of biodiversity. Understanding the    social, political, demographic and economic consequences of changes in land-use    and land-cover would prove to be an important link between human activity and    the carbon cycle – with its inherent effects on climate change.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Environmental change and human security, in the    same way, moves from common concerns in the social science community to refocusing    the issues in terms of climate change. What has been called the risk society    places humankind in a new, vulnerable relationship to the world, and environmental    issues are among the principal factors involved. Whether in the various approaches    to food security (from labeling to diet patterns to transgenics to outright    hunger), or by way of exposure to thousands of chemical compounds whose cumulative    effect is unknown, or from the conflicts around such essential resources as    water, the perspective of environment and security provides a path for incorporating    the concern for the effects of climate change on health and community well-being.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The study of institutions is among the most traditional    pursuits of sociology. The creation and development of institutions in the environmental    field has generated much research in both North and South in the last quarter-century,    as the environmental issue has become embedded in contemporary societies. Indeed,    the institutionalization of environmental protection and of environmentalism    itself is a major fact of our times. For sociologists and political scientists    who study institutions, the move to focusing on the role of environmental and    resource regimes, or of other institutions such as trade and investment regimes    in causing/confronting global environmental changes is a logical step, one for    which the conceptual basis has been well established. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The study of industrial transformation brings    some reluctant participants into the discussion. Economics – most especially    in Brazil – has not been at the forefront of environmental social science. Industrial    transformation, however, has been a central issue for economists, and the move    to more environmentally friendly production processes; the use of alternative    fuels; production which is less energy- and materials-intensive are issues which    tie into some of the most basic links of human activity to climate change. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Among the newer core projects is that on urbanization.    The environmental changes associated to urbanization had already been identified    by the Brazilian Committee as central issues from the perspective of developing    countries in 2000, when a chapter on the topic was commissioned for the book    mentioned earlier. The rapid pace of urbanization in Brazil, especially in Amaz&ocirc;nia    and in the <I>cerrado</I>, and all of the profound changes this has meant in    national life mean that this process is related to all of the issues addressed    in this paper. As one of the major transformations of Brazilian life in recent    decades, its implications for values, behavior and national priorities related    to climate change are multiple and profound. From the IHDP’s point of view,    this is an issue which is set to take off as a core project.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>4 <I>Conclusions</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A reading of the international experience recommends    both focusing on a limited number of themes and choosing themes in consonance    with this experience. These issues are currently the object of research by the    Brazilian environmental social science community, even though researchers have    not often identified the link with climate change. If they can be induced to    identify a place for themselves in this scenario and to recognize that climate    change is being approached by way of issues they are indeed currently researching,    they may be drawn in to the growing community of human dimensions scholars.    As a rather esoteric, remote issue, without clear links to current social processes,    it will not motivate this community.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>Notes</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="nt01"></a><a href="#tx01">1</a> Social    sciences, broadly understood. In Brazil, following French traditions, the field    of human sciences includes social sciences, economics, history, demography,    social psychology as well as several applied fields.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="nt02"></a><a href="#tx02">2</a> Among    the projects not selected was GOES – the Global Omnibus Environmental Survey,    a project which would have conducted periodic international surveys to monitor    public opinion on global change. Led by the Survey Research Center of the University    of Michigan, GOES was the first project to mobilize the Brazilian Social Science    community. In the year preceding the Vienna meeting, researchers from Unicamp,    USP, UFMG, UnB and ISER met several times, in Brazil and at the University of    Michigan, to prepare this project. While the IHDP did not select it as a core    project, GOES was carried out in the late 1990s. Without international funding,    it proved impossible to carry out a national survey in Brazil, although pre-testing    was done in Campinas, Belo Horizonte, S&atilde;o Paulo and several other sites.    The results are published in Peter Ester, Henk Vinken, Solange Sim&otilde;es,    Midori Aoyagi-Usui (eds.), Culture and sustainability: a cross-national study    of cultural diversity and environmental priorities among mass public and decision    makers, Dutch University Press, 2003. It includes chapters by S. Sim&otilde;es,    E. Viola and D. Hogan on partial Brazilian surveys.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="nt03"></a><a href="#tx03">3</a> Google    provides a measure of the success of these activities: a search for climate    change produced approximately 212,000,000 results, while a similar search for    human dimensions of climate change produced approximately 11,200,000 results,    nearly 20% of the total.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="nt04"></a><a href="#tx04">4</a> On this    occasion, the Committee organized a book of commissioned chapters to present    Brazilian views on human dimensions to the international community. This book,    D. Hogan and M. Tolmasquin (eds.), Human Dimensions of Global Environmental    Change: Brazilian Perspectives, Rio de Janeiro, Academia Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncias,    Rio de Janeiro, 2001, remains one of the few publications on human dimensions    in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="nt05"></a><a href="#tx05">5</a> The    IHDP’s Annual Report for 2004-2005 registers eight researchers from Brazilian    institutions, only three of whom are social scientists. The other five became    involved in human dimensions research as an aspect of their research in the    exact sciences. Of the three social scientists, none participate in a core project:    Eduardo Viola was co-chair of the 2005 Open Meeting; Roberto Guimar&atilde;es    is a member of the IHDP Steering Committee; and Daniel Hogan was a member of    the Steering Committee of the Population-Environment Research Network, a joint    activity of the IUSSP and IHDP.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="nt06"></a><a href="#tx06">6</a> This    attitude does not derive from any isolation of this community from international    debate; indeed, Brazilian environmental social science has been at the forefront    of research, participating intensely in international fora.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="nt07"></a><a href="#tx07">7</a> The    IHDP does not finance research, but the identification of a project with one    of the core projects has proven useful in securing funding; the principal gain    for participating groups has been through the collective work of defining concepts,    research strategies and research designs, as well as the exchange of results.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="end"> </a><a href="#tx"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v10n2/seta.gif" border="0"></a>    <b>Autor para correspond&ecirc;ncia:</b>    <br>   Daniel Joseph Hogan    <br>   N&uacute;cleo de Estudos e Pesquisas Ambientais, Universidade Estadual de Campinas    – UNICAMP    ]]></body>

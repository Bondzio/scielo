Abstract This article examines how political parties incorporate environmental issues in their party programs. The methodology consisted in monitoring thewebsites of political parties, with a mapping of the strategies used in relation to the environmental agenda. The survey was conducted in the period August-September 2014, during the election campaign. Of the 32 parties registered with the Electoral Court, 20 incorporate environmental themes into their websites (62.5%), through four main strategies: inclusion of the issue in the party program, creating thewebsites nucleus to environmental issue, offeringonline courses in environmental education and dissemination of environmental news. Four profiles of environmental governance are identified: preservationists, developmental, critical of capitalism and systemic ecologists. In all profiles, the state plays a central role as an actor of environmental policies proposed by parties. The wide partisan adherence to ecological issues shows that the green agenda has become established and a political issue transparty theme, beyond the left x right divide.

Abstract In this paper, we seek to present the culturalist lineage of the Brazilian Soccer Sociology and demonstrate the historical endurance of force-ideas crucial to this &#8220;intellectual family&#8221;. We also aim to restore some of the relative analytical peculiarities inherent to this lineage, as well as to point out some social effects of the circulation of these ideas in the logic of national identity reiteration. The text is divided into three acts. In the first, we revisited in general lines the founding enterprise of Gilberto Freyre and MÃ¡rio Filho regarding the culturalist interpretation of Brazilian football; in the second, we recover the theoretical model of DaMatta and defend the systematizing character of its analysis at the heart of this &#8220;intellectual family&#8221;; and, in the third, we provide some clues on the routinization of this culturalist reading of football in Brazil and its naturalized repercussion in this society.

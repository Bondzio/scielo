The study of social identities raises the need of mediating between which is individual and which is collective. Through a description called &#8220;self&#8221; we elicit the narrational identity &#8211; constructing itself during the open interview &#8211; in the enunciation of the speech act. The pattern woven by the narrated self is unfolded by our own narrative programme as its interpreters. Epistemological and theoretical topics are implicit when we (re)-present our interviewees as peculiars of base, body and subjectivity and when we move away from typifications or ideal types. Our &#8220;self&#8221; reappropiates the agent in his/her self-intentionality and self-designation, and takes the referencial and reflexion duplicity of language. The description of the selftransits that duplicity to give the actors perspective, built in the interlocutory situation. The identifyng reference is not only a subjects self-designation but an interlocutory relation as well, which includes the receptor as a co-participant in the semantic process and the referential allusion. It is argued for the legitimacy of the investigators turning that identifying reference into another aspect of his/her study object.

This article, a part of a broader study analyzing the school's structure, presents and discusses some results of a qualitative research carried out in an elementary public school. It concentrates on questions related to the teaching job, such as pedagogical assistance, objective working conditions and time management in teacher's everyday routine. Relying on a concept of education as a democratic practice that constructs human-historical personalities, the results suggest the need to transform the current school structure. They also point out the importance of considering the peculiar and unique character of the teaching work, in the process of finding solutions and making decisions to achieve a better education.

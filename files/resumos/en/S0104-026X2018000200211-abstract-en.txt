Abstract: The analysis regarding the participation of black women in carnival celebrations falls within well beyond the group's interests, considering that these festivities&#8217; paradigms and gender and women's issues cross the subject, inscribing the agenda in transnational reflections involving protagonists of different spectra. In this text, the main intention is to articulate these fields, without losing sight of the specifics related to Afro-descendant revellers and their mishaps, which manifest themselves immediately in the limitations of memorial records and historiography that transversally explore their role in these Sao Paulo unmistakable carnival frolics. In this sense, it is possible to see a sexist and selective reading of records of these appearances and, at the same time, it has a fragmented memory of this appearance that little has changed over the years. This route will be monitored between years 1921, the start date of black women appearance in a "carnival cord", and 1967, the closing date of SÃ£o Paulo "unofficial&#8221; carnivals. Therefore, who are the black women who were identified and worthy of this protagonism?

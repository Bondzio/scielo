This paper approaches the criticism of post-structural feminist theories as well as the theories of the universal subject, rejecting the notions of the essential identity of gender. The common point among the thinkers included in this work is the necessity to break with the traditional model of western philosophical traditions which are based upon dichotomous thinking models and thus deconstruct binary thinking. Their differences, however, lie especially in the area pertaining to the reconstruction of the subject of feminism. Such debates involve, at the same time, theoretical, methodological and political issues.

ABSTRACT This article has a practical purpose: to provide students and researchers with a set of strategies aimed at facilitating the building of a theoretical framework and its integration with the other parts of the study. This proposal is based on the identification and solution of three basic issues: 1) defining the object of study; 2) distributing the theoretical content into the different parts of the study; and 3) selecting the theoretical content of the study, which should be an integral part of the theoretical framework and include three dimensions: historical-contextual, conceptual and methodological.

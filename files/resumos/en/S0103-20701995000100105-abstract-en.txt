Power is defined in Michel Foucault's conceptions as a set of methodological cautions rather than a complete theory. As oposed to current modern conceptions, Foucault deals with a definition of power that does not include "the king" as a source and a center from where power is supposed to flow. After comparing different modern current definitions of power, emphasizing their need for the impersonation of a "king" to explain power, Foucault's definition is presented as an assymetrical relationship. Rather than two preexisting actors, one full of power and other powerless, which would explain authority and obedience, that relantionship is presented as resulting in the existence of two political actors, a "sovereign" and subject. As an illustration, a current situation in Brazilian politics is commented in Foucault's terme.

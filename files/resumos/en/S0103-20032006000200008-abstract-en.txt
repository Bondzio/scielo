This article is about "local agro-food systems" (LAS), clusters of activities of food production where primary production, processing outlets and marketing units are observed. Representing an extension to rural questions of the approaches which relate the possibilities of local and regional development to aspects like proximity, institutions and local articulations, this form of analysis emphasizes the importance of specific local resources, particularly the environmental and socio-cultural ones. The subject of LAS is taken in an analysis of mariculture in Santa Catarina, a sector in which this state has reached a remarkable position mainly as a producer of mollusks. The analysis highlights the importance of factors relating to "capital" in its human, social and natural forms, noticed along the coast of Santa Catarina, and points out the character of "resource specific" attached to the network of relationships behind the growth of mariculture, a network which is in itself an important innovation.

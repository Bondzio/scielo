In this article, we discuss the section Sexo of Capricho magazine as a cultural artifact. We understand that this artifact consists in a cultural pedagogy which produces and disseminates meanings on the theme of sexuality, operating it not only as a source of information or entertainment , but as a teaching tool that, besides allowing the discussion of issues such as genital systems, contraceptive methods, AIDS and STD, that are already present in the school curriculum and the National Curriculum Parameters (PCN), promotes the inclusion of yearnings, fears, pleasures, behavior, gender, that are not always approached in the curriculum, thereby problematizing different representations and meanings attributed to sexuality in our society.

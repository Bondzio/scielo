The thinking on the importance and the place of Marxism in Brazilian society, be it in political and social life, be it in the intellectual and cultural output, has gained an outstanding path with the completion of the collective work History of Marxism in Brazil. An inventory, even a precarious one, of its gaps and overlaps also allows for an overview of the bibliographic output on Brazilian Marxism. Starting from this, it becomes possible to highlight structures and trends in its historical development.

Our goal in this paper is to evaluate the quantitative effects on exports of agricultural commodities of Brazilian cooperatives from several scenarios of possible trade agreements faced by Brazil. This paper is focused on exports of commodities under higher influence of cooperative firms. We use a computable general equilibrium model to simulate alternative scenarios of trade liberalization for Brazilian economy and their impacts on the sectors on focus. We also consider results from the previous studies. We seek to identify main interests to the Brazilian cooperatives on the negotiation of such agreements, considering impacts on production and the flow of trade. The best outcomes considering those sectors with high cooperative participation and trade agreements considered here could be summarized as: a partial multilateral liberalization for the poultry, pork and soybean sectors; an agreement Mercosul-EU for the soybean and coffee sectors; and full liberalization FTAA for the coffee sector.

An integration    of this Declaration with the International Development Goals resulted in the    Eighth Millenium Development Goals,<a name="top04"></a><a href="#back04"><sup>4</sup></a>    which took into account the conservation of biodiversity, the combat of deforestation,    the management of sustainable lands, the protection and promotion of human health    and the combat of poverty. The Eighth Millenium Development Goals were the basis    for the formulation of programs, by the UNDP, to respond to those challenges,    and to be discussed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, in Johannesburg,    2002. One of these programs came to be the Equator Initiative, and the institution    of the Equator Prize. The communities nominated for this prize, as mister Kofi    A Annan said, demonstrated that the Millenium Goals are within reach, and that    there are effective local solutions to many of the most pressing challenges    of human development, including poverty and biodiversity loss. <a name="top05"></a><a href="#back05"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This report tries to make one initial consideration about the 27 demonstration-projects and communities selected by the Equator Prize, in relation to those goals, particularly to the ones included in the Environmental Sustainability and Global Partnership for Development Goals. It also states, as a personal observation, that the Equator Initiative has been a congregation of multiple and differentiated cultural manifestation, of political diversification, and of environmentally rich projects which were put together in a meeting with the same spiritual feeling of solidarity.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Or, as Mister Ian    Johnson said, we can reduce world poverty in ways that advance equity and environmental    sustainability, but it will require collective community action, from small    civil society organizations to large multinational corporations, from local    and national governments to international agencies. We must all play our part.    <a name="top06"></a><a href="#back06"><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>A) THE EQUATOR    INITIATIVE</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Equator Initiative is a program promoted by the United Nations Development Programme - UNDP, in partnership with the United Nations Foundation, The World Conservation Union- IUCN, The Nature Conservancy, the International Development Research Center- IDRC, Brazil Connects, the Government of Canada and the Television Trust for the Environment (TVE). It provides a vital link between local work of communities to combat poverty and sustain biodiversity and a global audience dedicated to the advancement of human development (Annan, K. 2002).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The ideas for the    creation of the Equator Initiative came, at first, from the comprehension that    the challenges of poverty and biodiversity loss cannot be dealt with isolation,    and more, that the two issues are inseparable, specially in the Equator Belt    where the world's greatest concentrations of poverty and biodiversity overlap    ( Wirth, T. 2002).<a name="top07"></a><a href="#back07"><sup>7</sup></a> This    initiative addresses local development challenges and works with issues of structure    set by the World Summit on Sustainable Development - water, energy, health,    agriculture and biodiversity and ecosystem services, also recognizing that partnership    is another central theme of the Conference (Annan, K. 2002).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This initiative    promoted the Equator Prize which, through the Equator Initiative Advisory Committee,    asked for local environmental projects in countries within the Equator influence,    where the world's greatest concentration of both human poverty and biological    wealth is located. 420 nominated projects from 77 countries within the Equatorial    Belt were evaluated. 27 projects were selected by the Equator Prize Jury for    final consideration .<a name="top08"></a><a href="#back08"><sup>8</sup></a>    This initiative placed these nominated communities at the cutting edge of the    transformation of global knowledge on sustainable development into concrete    action (Brown, M. M. 2002).<a name="top09"></a><a href="#back09"><sup>9</sup></a></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 27 projects represent 19 countries in the three continents, Africa, Asia and Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean. In this last one, projects of World Heritage Sites have been also selected. All of these projects reflected communities that worked to reduce poverty and conserve biological diversity in their environmental programs.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The African continent presented seven projects from five countries, Cameron, Comoros, Kenya (two), Madagascar, and Tanzania (two). Asia and Pacific came with six projects from four countries, Fiji, India (three), Malaysia and Thailand.

So, local sustainable development has been seen here from the point of view of these communities, their culture and technological knowledge, organization of work, articulation with other organizations (as NGOs and local, regional and national government) and financial structure, from global and local agencies.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The report of IDRC    <a name="top011"></a><a href="#back011"><sup>11</sup></a> analyses the 27 selected    communities based on seven main questions, which were related since to motivation    until to building capacity needs of the projects. The questions are: <i>Project    catalysts</i>, pointing out the motivation for the outset of the projects; <i>Community    dynamics</i>, involving local, indigenous, and sectional groups, and minority    groups empowerment; <i>Contributions</i>, from communities, external funding,    other partnerships, enterprises and governments; <i>Factors</i> contributing    to the spread and support of the projects, as education and training, citizen    empowerment, networking and documentation; <i>Key factors</i> that led to the    success of the initiatives, involving social management as management committees,    transparency and reporting with stakeholders, education and training component;    <i>Technical questions</i>, as protection and restoration of biological resources    and technology and knowledge transference; <i>Institution and policy change</i>,    as development of formal partnerships and revised legislation; and <i>Capacity    building needs,</i> as financial assistance, education and training, ecological    management, infrastructure, health and market expansion.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some conclusions of this analysis explain the success of the initiatives. In general terms, the key factors are the active participation of all community members, the transparency and reporting between the community and all of its stakeholder partners, and the knowledge of the importance of restoration, monitoring and protection of ecosystems resources.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"The key factors that led to the success of initiatives are by: The active participation of all community members, especially women, in strong, formal, community-based management and partnerships. A coordinating mechanism between all stakeholders to provide a management structure for sustainable utilization of resources and the promotion of the value of biodiversity in each community; this includes economic decision making and resource management. The support of government and local industry, formalized into a partnership agreement that emphasizes sustainable development objectives.</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The transparency and reporting between the community and its stakeholder partners.

Common groups of people identified by the communities include: farmers, fishermen, local inhabitants/indigenous communities, research institutions/scientists, schools/teachers, NGOs, women, elders, young people, government and administrative authorities, traditional authorities and involvement of all ethnic groups and social classes.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some communities created natural resources management committees. In some cases new legislation was enacted based on lessons learned through the projects. Other projects made the transformation of regulation from command and control to economically based. The majority of communities obtained financial resources from partnerships. The needs are focused on the areas of capacity building, education, access to health, participation in decision-making, creation of space where researchers can experiment with new environmental management plans. The help they receive decreases the exodus of community members, particularly women.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many stakeholders, such as NGOs and people from other villages, had knowledge and techniques that they introduced to the community. Many skills were taught to the communities through education and training.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After that, the report lists a series of recommendations based on the seven stages of a cycling process (Miller and Lanou 1995): <i>Organization of Work; Assessment; Developing a Strategy; Developing a Plan of Action; Implementation by Stakeholders; Monitoring and Evaluation; Periodic Reporting.</i></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The recommendation    to the communities takes them as able to: explain the rationale of taking action    and document the development and implementation of the project; understand and    explain the process of implementation of the project so as to control its different    aspects; identify the progress achieved so that the gains are not lost or eroded    without the communities' knowledge; prevent a return to the situation which    prevailed at the beginning of the project; identify for themselves the factors    which contribute to the success of their initiative and the factors which could    have a negative impact on the future development of their project; and to understand    the importance of replication so that their initiative can become a benefit    to other communities.<a name="top013"></a><a href="#back013"><sup>13</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>C) THE PROJECTS    BALANCE</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will develop this chapter showing a synthetic panel of the main propositions of the projects, their regional and continental similarities, and the main lessons learned.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The African projects    &#150;Honey Care Africa, Il Ngwesi Group Ranch, CACID: Support Group for Conservation    and Sustainable Development Initiatives, FITEMA: Association of Manambolo Natives,    Moh&eacute;li Marine Park, Hashi Soil Conservation Project, and Suledo Forest    Community&#150; deal mainly with communities established in common properties,    receiving more common benefits in water, transportation, health and education    than individual grants for each family, mainly working with restoration of biodiversity    (for example in flood plain as CACID project), on sustainable income generation    (Honey Care Africa), tribes knowledge, practices and attitudes of forests restoration    (HASHI project, Suledo Forest Community, Association of Manambolo Natives- FITEMA),    eco-tourism (I1 Ngwesi Group Ranch), and protection of marine life (Moheli Marine    Park).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Asian and Pacific projects &#150;Fiji Locally - Managed Marine Area Network, Medicinal Plants Conservation Center, Kerala Kani Samudaya Kshema Trust, Tribal Communities of the Jeypore Tract of Orissa, Uma Bawang Residents' Association, and CBIRD Center Sub-Tai&#150; work with resources from their biodiversity, in eco- pharmacology, ethno-botany, hand made products, including the transference of royalties to tribes (as Kerala Kani tribe), utilizing herbal gardens in communities, promoting revitalization of medical heritage (for example, the Medicinal Plants Conservation Center), and restoring fishing resources (as Fidji Locally-Managed Marine Park Network), as a role to maintain biodiversity, revitalize local health and food traditions, and sustain daily livelihoods.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can divide the Latin America and Caribbean projects in three parts: projects from Brazil, projects from Latin America and Caribbean, and projects of World Heritage, because of their regional, cultural and institutional specific features.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The four projects of Brazil, AVIVE: Green Life Association of Amaz&ocirc;nia, Bolsa Amaz&ocirc;nia, Amazon Life Project and Canan&eacute;ia Oyster Producers Cooperative, are divided in the ones from Amaz&ocirc;nia basin, where the national interest on local sustainable development mostly is, and one from the state of S&atilde;o Paulo, where the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, the biggest urbanization of Latin America, live together with poor little communities of the Atlantic Forest. The Brazilian Amazon basin projects, as the Asian and Pacific ones, also deal with natural resources and biodiversity, as the project of rubber vulcanization, projects for the production of clothes and bags (Amazon Life Project), home products of natural medicine and cosmetics (AVIVE project), and jointing sustainable agriculture and agro-industrialization, production of pulps, honey, oils and hand-made objects (Bolsa Amazonia). An additional similarity with other African, Asian and Latin American projects is the utilization of women work, who combine their home affairs with the development of products through the use of resources found near their homes and families, as in Silves (Brasil), Granma (Cuba), Pune (India) and Waza- Logone (Cameron).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The project from S&atilde;o Paulo was part of a great international program of the World Bank, named Projects of Decentralized Execution (PDE) which were composed by demonstrative projects on sustainable development. That project, managed by afro descendants (the Mandira community), works with resources (oysters) in a mangrove forest with the aggregation of products processing techniques.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The projects of Latin America and the Caribbean &#150;Toledo Institute for Development and Environment (TIDE), Inter-institutional Consortium for Sustainable Agriculture on Hillsides (CIPASLA), Bayamo Whole Forest Company, Management and Conservation Organization (OMYC), Caf&eacute; de la Selva, Campesino to Campesino Programme of the Municipality of Siuna (PC a C) and Ese' eja Community of Infierno&#150; follow the same characteristics of the ones already described.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can see the promotion of income generation in eco-tourism (Toledo Institute for Development and Environment- TIDE and Ese' eja Community of Infierno, as Il Ngwesi Group Ranch in Africa), or in the cultivation of resources (coffee in Caf&eacute; de la Selva, as well as Honey in Honey Care Africa); community knowledge in forests restoration, here with the peculiarity of the construction of ecological forestry farms (Bayamo Whole Forest Company) with green agricultural practices (Campesino to Campesino Programme,) or including wildlife conservation (Management and Conservation Organization - OMYC); protection of the environment with reduction in poverty and restoration of resources (with agro-ecology in Watershed-River Cabuyal Watershed Users Association and fishing in a flood plain area, at the African project CACID).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, we have the three projects of World Heritage Sites, within Maya and Tawakla Biosphere Reserves, Talamanca Iniciative and Association of Forest Communities of Pet&eacute;n (ACOPOF), both in Maya Reserve and Mosquitia Pawisa Agency for the Development of Honduras (Mopawi), in Tawahka Reserve. They work with wild life conservation, promotion of organic agriculture and tourism (Talamanca Initiative), sustainable management of resources of forests (ACOPOF), protection of forests and species, as the green Iguana, the recognition of community land rights, (MOPAWI), as Talamanca project, with environmental action for cultivation in organic way (cacao), and improvement of eco-tourism.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We realize that, at least and in general terms, the social practices and the construction of Latin projects follow the same structure of all projects presented in the Equator Prize, including participation of all communities in production and management, in qualifying, in the generation of social incomes and restoration of biodiversity demonstrated during the presentation of all projects at the Equator Initiative Seminar, on Ubuntu Village, during WSSD.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The lessons learned    (<a name="top014"></a><a href="#back014">14</a>) include: the organization of    large association for economic reasons (Honey Care Africa); the promotion of    a better knowledge and an improvement of building capacity (Il Nwesi Group Ranch);    the increase of eco-tourism activities (CACID); the improvement of e-commerce    for amazon products (Bolsa Amaz&ocirc;nia); the increase of national institutional    partnership (AVIVE), the continuing minimization of costs through participation    of the community (Suledo Forest Community); the strengthening of strategic partnership    with NGOs specialized in social and environmental aspects (Ese'eja Community    of Infierno); the transference of methodologies of integrating productive projects    (CIPASLA- ASOBESURCA); the capacity to work with the given structures, following    the community's rhythm, and seeing them with no idealization (FITEMA); the promotion    of previous training to allow the communities adaptation to the proposition    (Moh&eacute;li Marine Park); the involvement of the communities in forests conservation    (ACOPOF); the development of networks, human resources and strategic plans (Caf&eacute;    de la Selva), the increase of conservation strategies to save plants (Tribal    Community of Jeypore) among others.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>D) CONCLUSIONS:    THE CATEGORIES OF SUSTAINABILITY IN THE TWENTY SEVEN LOCAL PROJECTS AND THEIR    RESULTANTS</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next step to understand the projects dynamics and dimensions is to present one analysis through the several categories of sustainability given by the researches and theoretical approaches. "When we ask about the sustainability level we want, or we may look for, we must examine the ideological, social and institutional contradictions contained on that discussion, and analyze the distinct sustainability dimensions to transform them in objective criteria of public policy" (Guimar&atilde;es, 1997). It's also necessary, for qualitative and quantitative measurement purposes, to analyze their practices objecting the re-qualification of the goals, the proposition of new programs, the strengthening of partnerships, and the organization of networks of information and re-applicability.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of the Equator Initiative local programs and projects contain, at least, five categories of sustainability: political, institutional, economical, physical-environmental and cultural.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The political sustainability, manifested in international agreements (Viola, 1998, 1997), generates the institution of environmental programs, that included management and decentralization, allied with models of local development projects, taking into account the 21 Agenda and the local resultants of the Conventions of Climate and Biodiversity . In those models it is possible to see also new patterns of planning and execution, based on independence, transparency, participation and partnership. The political and institutional sustainability may be confirmed trough the reunion of these elements, and also by the given articulation between the global and the local, with the maintenance of the connections between the participants of all involved institutions, prioritizing new actors and practices, based on confidence, rigor and responsibility. The Equator Initiative obtained this kind of sustainability in quite all their projects, also innovating with the implementation of laws and local agreements. The best examples are the projects that influenced, in 2001, the Rural Land Law in Tanzania, and the one that developed the concept of benefit-sharing with the tribal community, leading to policy changes in the Biodiversity Bill in India.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may summarize the political sustainability of local projects in convergent politics of global investments and national socio-environmental decentralization, good institutional strategies, strengthened social actors and independence in decentralized management.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The institutional sustainability constitutes the strongest part of local programs. Institutional strengthening of national public agencies, creation of new organisms, re-adequacy of functions, and the creation of regional program linked to environmental qualification were also contemplated in the projects presented.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main examples    are from the projects that made the transformation of regulation from command    and control to economically-based, and the ones where the communities obtained    financial resources from partnerships. Only one community obtained finances    through self organization. Another received a local contribution; both are from    Africa.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Needs are focused in the areas of capacity building, education, access to health, participation in decision-making, etc. Many communities need help to educate and train leaders and community members on how to run the project in a better way, and look at ways to increase financial capacity, improve communication by improving and building roads"(IDRC conclusions).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may also verify in the projects the general items required to this kind of sustainability, as global and local strengthening of institutional structures, the vertical and transversal trends of these articulations with co-responsibility, new actors organized in new institutional ways of life, and the increase of the horizontal environmental sustainability internalization process.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among others, the economic sustainability is difficult to be evaluated because of the financial and post-financial phases of the projects, and the aggregation of different kinds of assessment in its different phases. The quantification of all this assessments and complementary works is not given by economic indicators, and the sign of success of these kinds of projects links social and economic appropriation together . We must stress that the debate of the phases of management and business propositions is necessary to these kinds of projects. So, grants for management and business plans are essential for permanent economic sustainability, as well as other activities of management, as production, commercialization, institutional and technical capability, and specialized assessment.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The list of all stakeholders contributions involve community contributions, with all 27 involved in a kind of support (labor, land, education), external funding by Embassies, NGOs and Agencies (in 18 projects), UNDP (4 projects), Enterprises and Market development (3 projects) and one Government contribution (IDRC, pg.6).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The economic structure for sustainability may be translated, at least, in global financial sustainability, return of costs of capital efficiency, institutional costs rationalization and, mainly local management organization, during pre and post investments consolidation, besides global and local political guaranties to their complete implementation.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The physical-environmental sustainability reflects the social efforts to achieve this model. For that, the social actors, regardless their class or ideology, become involved and, looking for results and solutions, create associations, modernize local public agencies, increase assessments and reach isolated social sectors. And considering all the criteria and limits of the laws and the institutional standardization, they create a physical network, incipient but quantified, to measure the experiences of sustainability.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The projects presented deal with different biomes, and their main questions are the risks of globalization, as loss of bio-diversity, exhaustion of renewable resources, soil degradation and biomass appropriation (Giddens, 1991). The projects also try to overcome the challenges of nature valuation and markets issues, all of that allied to new individual values and ethics.At last, the projects are part of a global consensus on a transition to sustainability strategies, as the ones appointed by Goodland(1991), Guimar&atilde;es (1998), Martine (1993), Hogan (1993) and Sachs (1994).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the Equator Initiative, we saw 27 demonstrative projects working with great environmental questions of global and regional intervention. The projects reflect local actions against the risky questions mentioned above. Many of the projects were initiated due to post-disaster situations. The types of disasters identified by the communities include: environmental disasters (such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and soil erosion), unsustainable resource extraction (such as clear-cutting forests, slash and burn agriculture, destructive oil extraction), construction projects (such as dams, roads), political/legal situations (such as civil war, government laws and control and land concessions), social situations (such as high birth rates, influx of immigrants, labor shortages and poverty) and economic/market situations (crash in market prices, poaching and illegal trafficking).</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mainly environmental references of them are: at reforestation of forests; in rural forest communities; management of forest and coastal resources in environmental preservation areas, with management of mangrove resources, including industrialization and depuration; management of biodiversity with introduction of alternative technologies; activities with apiculture; promotion of the ecotourism with biodiversity, and environmental education, that may be found on practically all the social territory of the programs.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Forests restoration is included in resources restoration, and livelihood in hydroelectric dams, as the project Support Group of Conservation and Sustainable Development Initiatives (CACID) from Cameroon/ Africa; and in the watershed management, as Interinstitutional Consortium for Sustainable Agriculture on Hillsides/ River Cabujal Watershed Users Association (CIPASLA- ASOBESURCA), in Colombia/ Latin America and Caribbean</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But quite every project presented some problems in social and productive appropriation. Among the main problems detected, we may list: inadequate production management; inadequate buildings norms; products licenses required; lack of necessary public infra-structure; as sanitation, difficulties and vagaries in the management of enterprises directly linked to public power; inadequate enforcement; disrespect in the management of plans, and the necessity to include questions of capacity, management and association as essential questions to the organization of local sustainability.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The physical-environmental sustainability of local programs may be given, so, by: the proposition of compatible buildings with programmed production structure; the inclusion of land questions, public and private physical infra-structure and licenses systems; management and business plans to enable the success of the post- financial phase of the projects; initial capacity of coordinators, managers, and technicians responsible for administrative and technical management of NGOs and co-participant associations; enforcing systems, monitoring and evaluation of programs at the local, regional, national and global levels, with the participation of all partners of the projects; and evaluation of the positive and negative environmental impact degree on the ecosystems, including renovation of managed natural resources, possibilities to re-apply the projects in ecosystems of same degree, and insertion, on international monitoring systems, of regional and global risks resources.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And finally, the cultural sustainability is given by the concomitant appropriation of experts and traditional systems of culture, even by the insertion of traditional populations, their resources management forms, necessary associative and land ownership structures, as by technical and institutional pertinent assessments, assessed to the organization of programs, technical, administrative and institutional management and global articulation. In fact, the IDRC Report, in its conclusions, observes that "the technologies and approaches used by the communities are many and varied. Some technologies/approaches are new and innovative, while others are based on skills of the community members and still others based on traditional practices. A common theme, however, is that many of the technologies and approaches used, emerged as a result of stakeholder and community involvement in the processes". For that, the ethical knowledge could be put in practice, privileging the "knowledge" notion, not only as a denotative elements conjunction, but also as ideas of how to do, how to live, how to ear (Lyotard, 1989), allied to a competence that exceeds the application of a mere criterion of the truth and enlarges the criteria of efficiency (technical qualification), justice and/or happiness (ethical wisdom). So, the concerns to be firmed are those that permit to circumscribe a determinate knowledge on the constitutive culture of the people. The degree of execution difficulty presented by the programs is, in fact, resultant either by the lack of technical capacity of traditional populations, or by the lack of precise diagnosis of how much this popular knowledge "teaches" to technical participants, what are the alternative forms, social and environmentally generous and correct, in the management of natural and environmental resources and their resultant products.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One last particular    question must be appointed, and it is the one that concerns with the new manifestations    on gender. In fact, examples in India and Cuba could show us that the participation    of women in the organization, articulation and conservation in local projects    are fundamental. In Cuba, they developed an agreement on gender perspectives    to ensure equity between men and women which is an innovative initiative in    the regional context (IDRC- conclusions). In India, women participation on projects    of management of medicinal plants could aggregate the many social traditional    functions they are responsible for, as family and home, with the organization    of the extensive work required by the projects.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>BIBLIOGRAPHY</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FERREIRA, Leila C.

Home    to a 170,000 hectare UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a rich diversity of plant    and animal species, the floodplain was nearly destroyed by construction of a    large hydroelectric dam in 1979. To restore the wetland and the livelihoods    of its inhabitants, CACID formed a collaborative management committee composed    of park management and community representatives to co-manage the natural resources    of the region. CACID has also led local efforts to restore the water balance    of the plain. Since 1992, CACID has rallied stakeholders to promote re-emergence    of the wetlands through sound natural resource management and small-scale eco-development    that has not only succeeded in restoring the ecological fabric of the floodplain,    but has also brought opportunities for sustainable income generation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Comoros     <br>   Moh&eacute;li Marine Park</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Home to a rich    variety of plant and animal species, including the dugong and the Livingstone    fruit bat, the Comorien Island of Moh&eacute;li is a treasure trove of biodiversity.    To protect this natural legacy, 10 villages in southern Moh&eacute;li began    in 1995 to advocate for designation of their offshore waters as a marine park.    Guided by the principle of participatory co-management of natural resources,    these villages and the Comorien government worked for six years towards establishment    of Moh&eacute;li Marine Park. Through extensive consultations, agreements for    co-management were signed between the government and each of the 10 villages.    As a result of the dedication of community residents and the collaborative Park    Management Committee, Moh&eacute;li has now seen a doubling of revenues for    local fisher folk, protection of 45 green turtle breeding beaches, and a halt    to destructive reef fishing practices.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Kenya    <br>   Honey Care Africa Ltd.</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Based on a vision    of environmentally sustainable income generation, Honey Care Africa works in    a mutually beneficial relationship with rural beekeepers to reduce poverty and    promote biodiversity conservation in Kenya. By encouraging sustainable income    generation, Honey Care Africa helps protect species-rich natural areas in Kenya    from overuse and encroachment. Honey Care Africa also helps reduce poverty by    guaranteeing to purchase all the honey produced by participating households    at a competitive price through direct cash payments. As a result, close to 2,000    rural Kenyan households are now able to rely on beekeeping for supplementary    income. In total, these households care for 10,000 individual hives and produce    60-96 metric tons of honey for sale annually. Most importantly, these households    are able to earn US$200-250 per year - an amount that is often enough to make    the difference between living above or below the poverty line.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Kenya    <br>   I1 Ngwesi Group Ranch</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The I1 Ngwesi Group    Ranch on Kenya's Laikipia Plateau has had great success in reducing local poverty    and conserving biodiversity through promotion of ecotourism and establishment    of a community owned trust responsible for local land management. The ranch    itself is a collectively owned initiative of 499 local households that incorporates    an exclusive ecotourism lodge and a locally led committee responsible for land    and resource management. By limiting poaching through community patrols and    leading efforts to sustainably manage local resources, the trust has helped    to secure a more certain future for wildlife on I1 Ngwesi and neighboring reserves.    Poverty at I1 Ngwesi has been tackled through the redirection of tourism revenues    back to the local community. By adopting a collaborative approach to resource    management, I1 Ngwesi has achieved remarkable success in promoting local livelihoods    without compromising the integrity of the natural environment.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Madagascar    <br>   Association of Manambolo Natives (FITEMA)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Madagascar,    a global hotspot of biodiversity, the Association of Manambolo Natives (FITEMA)    has looked to an indigenous land use system, called Dina, to creatively re-establish    control over their resources and help preserve the species-rich forests and    swamps of the Manambolo Valley. Using the Dina system, FITEMA is working to    reverse destructive forest practices, provide food security, and protect biological    diversity. By negotiating with government agencies for local control over natural    resource management and establishing resident monitors and community guards    to protect local forests, FITEMA has been able to virtually eliminate deforestation    in the valley. Importantly, this work has linked existing reserves to form the    longest unbroken chain of intact forest in Madagascar. Poverty is also being    alleviated, through improved food and livelihood security, co-operative management    of resources, a reduction in conflict, and an improved relationship with government.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Tanzania    <br>   Hashi    Soil Conservation Project</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Tanzania, the    HASHI project has had broad success in reversing land degradation through a    rebirth of traditional forms of conservation. Through the project's work, people    have been able to re-establish their traditional Ngitili system of land management    with huge dividends both for the natural environment and the livelihoods of    communities. Through the Ngitili system of enclosures, farmers prolong the availability    of fodder during dry periods to better ensure the survival of their cattle.    Restored areas now support production of more food products, including fruits,    meat, and milk. As well, more tree varieties have been planted, soil conditions    have improved, wells have been restored, and households now spend less time    away from their farms searching for food and water. Biodiversity benefits have    arisen from the restoration of ecosystems, regrowth of tree species and medicinal    plants and the return of species to the arid region, including bird and butterfly    species.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Tanzania    <br>   Suledo Forest Community</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Harnessing their    knowledge of the species-rich Miombo forests of Tanzania's Arusha region, the    Suledo Forest Community has established an effective system of village-based    forest management that meets the diverse needs of local people. After being    spurred into action in 1993 by government plans for use of local forests, communities    have regained control over land management and have devised a system of unique    forest planning zones. To add weight to community anti-poaching rules, area    villages have passed supportive by-laws and members of local communities now    patrol each forest zone to ensure enforcement. As a result of these interventions,    villagers have access to a greater range of forest products, including sustainable    timber and products such as fruits, nuts, mushrooms and medicines. Water supply    has also been improved, sustainable tree nurseries, vegetable gardens and orchards    have been introduced, and maize production has increased from 15 to 25 bags    per hectare.</font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font size="2">Asia    And Pacific</font></b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fiji    <br>   Fiji    Locally-Managed Marine Area Network</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since its inception    in 1999, the Fiji Locally Managed Marine Area Network has grown to include communities    in six districts and cover 10% of the inshore marine area of Fiji. The involvement    of communities in the network has led to increases in the number and size of    clams, crabs, and other species harvested adjacent to taboo areas, where fishing    is prohibited. As a result, household incomes have increased 35% over three    years and catches have tripled. Much of the success of the network can be attributed    to its participatory and collaborative focus, which has ensured that local people    are at the center of the network's operations. As a testament to the success    of the network in protecting marine biodiversity and alleviating poverty in    fishing communities, the government of Fiji has recently incorporated many of    its approaches into national policies designed to protect the coastal resources    of Fiji for future generations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>India    <br>   Medicinal Plants Conservation Centre</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By recognizing    the strength of the link between plant resources and the livelihoods of rural    people, the Medicinal Plant Conservation Centre (MPCC) in Pune, India has achieved    great success in advancing the cause of medicinal plant conservation while also    lifting rural people out of poverty. In con-junction with local communities,    MPCC encourages economic development opportunities through cultivation of medicinal    plants, a decentralized system of nurseries raising 50,000 plants of 50 different    species, and a network of herbal production centers. By promoting cultivation    of medicinal herbs, MPCC relieves much of the pressure on dwindling natural    supplies of these plants. As well, through collaborative botanical inventories,    villagers and MPCC have laid a sound foundation for conservation work in the    state. Perhaps most importantly, the work of MPCC allows tribal communities,    previously excluded from conservation work, the opportunity to actively participate    in efforts to protect their botanical heritage.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>India    <br>   Kerala Kani Samudaya Kshema Trust</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Often, indigenous    people hold the only detailed knowledge of the curative properties of rare plant    species. This was the case with the Argyapacha plant (Trichopus zeylanicus)    of India, which was eaten by the Kani people to combat fatigue and reduce stress.    In a model of benefit sharing, however, the Kanis agreed with Kerala's Tropical    Botanic Garden and Research Institute (TBGRI), that they would reveal its properties    in exchange for an equal share of the benefits of commercialization. In 1997,    the resulting product was licensed and the Kani Trust was founded to represent    Kani communities and promote local development. So far, the Trust has supported    poor members of the community, provided insurance for pregnant women, and assisted    in cases of accidental death. Representing over 700 families, the Trust now    provides a critical source of employment to tribal people as cultivators and    processors of the plant, ensures that harvesting techniques are sustainable,    and empowers communities to become involved in conservation and development    to their own benefit and that of the wider world.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>India    <br>   Tribal Communities of the Jeypore Tract of Orissa</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Jeypore    Tract, Orissa, introduction of new crop varieties and forest degradation have    led to a dramatic decline in the number of native plant varieties. For instance,    native rice varieties have fallen from 1750 to 150 in number and are increasingly    under threat. To counter this decline and to ensure the security of their food    supply, tribal communities have initiated a programme to enable sustainable    livelihoods and promote agro-biodiversity conservation, community gene management,    and environmental protection. Local farmers are now involved in participatory    plant breeding and the compilation of community biodiversity registers, which    have been combined with the development of community seed and grain banks. Through    these initiatives, remaining varieties of rice are being conserved and over-exploited    medicinal plants are being cultivated in community gardens instead of being    harvested from the region's fragile forests. Critically, market linkages have    been created that allow communities to benefit financially from their conservation    activities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Malaysia    <br>   Uma Bawang Resident's Association (UBRA)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Malaysian    state of Sarawak, the Uma Bawang Resident's Association (UBRA) represents a    community of less than 100 people that has successfully used blockades, and    now innovative mapping efforts, to defend customary land rights and access to    forest lands. Critically, since UBRA's first mapping workshop in 1995, this    technique has been increasingly used by other communities to legally defend    their borders and secure recognition of traditional lands. UBRA also helps communities    learn a wide variety of skills that provide cash income, including communal    rice farming and milling, pig-rearing, handicrafts marketing, growing pepper    and fruit trees, and developing sustainable teakwood plantations. Projects supported    by UBRA provide incomes without endangering forest resources and are complemented    by work in reforestation and restoration of damaged forestlands. Since 1992,    UBRA has planted 4,000 tree seedlings in degraded areas, with an average of    200 fruit trees planted per family, and is leading a new reforestation initiative    focused on native species</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Thailand    <br>   Community Based Integrated Rural Development (CBIRD) Center, Sub Tai</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For many years,    residents of Sub Tai village, Thailand were forced to supplement their incomes    by poaching in nearby Khao Yai National Park, a repository of rare species and    Thailand's oldest national park. This all began to change in 1985 when the Population    and Community Development Association of Bangkok launched CBIRD Center in Sub    Tai to deal with issues of economic indebtedness and poaching. In this participatory    project, villagers signed a commitment not to cut trees or hunt in the park    in return for low-cost loans. To ensure that the rich biodiversity of Khao Yai    National Park is protected, loans are disbursed for ecological income generating    activities such as tree-planting and trekking services. As a result, income    in Sub Tai has nearly doubled and many community members are free from debt.    Through greater community involvement in park management, illegal logging in    the park has fallen by 75% and the many rare species of Khao Yai National Park,    including the Asian elephant and tiger, now have a more secure future.</font></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Latin    America and Caribbean</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>BELIZE    <br>   Toledo Institute for Development and Environment (TIDE)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Toledo Institute    for Development and Environment (TIDE) works in some of the poorest areas of    Belize and, through the Maya Mountain Marine Sustainable Livelihoods Initiative,    collaborates with local communities to promote sustainable income generation    and conservation. TIDE has focused much of its poverty reduction efforts on    certification programs and training, including an on-going program to train    and certify flyfishing guides and an "ECO-OK" certification project for sustainably    produced local timber. The project also supports microenterprise and ecotourism    training through a tourism arm, TIDETours. TIDETours subcontracts with small    community-based businesses trained by TIDE to return income to communities and    promote local enterprise. Through promotion of participatory co-management of    natural resources and development of community monitoring, the project has also    reduced poaching of endangered manatees, the practice of gillnetting, and illegal    hunting and logging.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Brazil    <br>   Green Life Association of Amaz&ocirc;nia (AVIVE)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AVIVE was founded    in the Brazilian city of Silves to defend and preserve the local environment    and culture while also working to improve the quality of life of local people,    especially women. Since being launched in 1999, much of AVIVE's work has focused    on developing techniques for sustainable extraction of the Aniba plant, also    known as pau-rosa, as well as other medicinal and aromatic native plant species.    The project also promotes the home production of natural medicines and cosmetics    as an economic alternative for the women of Silves. These products are now sold    in stores, catering to local consumers and tourists, and are marketed abroad    to generate income for local women. The organization also leads an important    environmental education program and produces seeds for the replanting and recovery    of regional forests, where extractive activities threaten biodiversity. To protect    the endangered pau-rosa and other rare plant species, AVIVE highlights the importance    of sustainable extraction and is actively involved in the creation of a Sustainable    Development Reserve where these species can be cultivated in ways that do not    imperil their existence.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Brazil    <br>   Bolsa Amaz&ocirc;nia</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Founded in 1998    by Brazilian NGOs, the Federal University of Par&aacute;, and international    donors, in partnership with private sector companies such as DaimlerChrysler,    Bolsa Amaz&ocirc;nia is a regional organization dedicated to developing sustainable    enterprises in rural forest communities of Amaz&ocirc;nia. With a focus on sustainable    agriculture and agro-industrialization, Bolsa Amaz&ocirc;nia assesses market    demand for locally produced sustainable products and supports development of    related goods, including coconut fiber gardening items, banana flour, frozen    fruit pulp, honey, oils, and hand-made paper and handicrafts. Building from    its local successes, Bolsa Amaz&ocirc;nia now has representative offices in    all Amaz&ocirc;nian countries and assists thousands of families with opportunities    for employment.

Launched in 1994, and expanded in 1997    to cover the entire Canan&eacute;ia estuary, the cooperative was established    to reconcile oyster harvesting with conservation of the region's highly biodiverse    mangrove forests. To ensure that harvesting activities are within the law, and    that destructive techniques are abolished, the cooperative has launched intense    efforts to promote community enforcement of regulations. As well, they have    worked to establish their own oyster brand. By skipping middlemen and building    a reputation for a quality product, they have tripled the price received for    their catch. As well, the installation of nurseries in all communities now allows    harvesting even when the natural harvesting season is closed. Through increased    incomes and an improved framework for conservation, the work of the Canan&eacute;ia    Oyster Producers Cooperative demonstrates the power of community-driven efforts    to conserve biodiversity and provide for sustainable economic development.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Brazil    <br>   Amazon Life Project</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Amazon Life    Project is a visionary alliance of three Brazilian rubber tapper associations,    the Nawa Institute for the Development of Sustainable Extractivism, and the    company Couro Vegetal da Amaz&ocirc;nia S.A. The objective of the project, launched    in 1991, is to make the rubber tapper's traditional handicraft competitive on    the international market while also ensuring that Amaz&ocirc;nian forests are    preserved for future generations. By working to develop, produce, and commercialize    the innovative Treetap&reg; vegetable leather product, the project contributes    to improving the quality of life in rubber tapping communities.

Specifically, the project is working to reforest the Cauto River    Basin, undertake hydrological cleaning through reforestation, provide job opportunities,    and generally improve food and environmental security. The main tool that the    project uses to meet these ends is the construction of "forestry farms". These    farms provide environmental and economic benefits to families who enjoy use    of 12 hectares of land for 30 years and are motivated through their "ownership"    to protect the plant and animal species that also call these forests home. Through    its comprehensive approach, the project has created 220 new jobs, helped control    soil erosion, and protected vital habitat for riverine and forest species.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Guatemala    <br>   Management and Conservation Organization (OMYC) / Wildlife Conservation Society    (WCS)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The working partnership    between OMYC, a grassroots community organization representing residents of    Uaxactun, and WCS-Guatemala, the local arm of an international NGO, is a model    for how organizational collaboration can be used as an effective tool to fight    biodiversity loss and poverty. Recognizing that these challenges can not be    addressed by a short-term project, OMYC and WCS work together to sustainably    manage an 83,558 hectare forest concession in Uaxactun. Together, they help    ensure that local livelihoods are sustainable and that plant and animal species    are protected. These projects include important studies of wild turkey conservation    and palm leaf harvesting sustainability. This work is critical from a biological    standpoint as well as socio-economically since both local turkey and palm populations    serve as important sources of income. The partnership has also launched efforts    to develop an integrated vision for resource management in Uaxactun, diversify    the local economy, and protect the natural resources upon which local people    depend.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mexico    <br>   Caf&eacute; de la Selva</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Caf&eacute; de    la Selva is a chain of coffee shops that sells organic coffee grown by indigenous    communities from Chiapas. The chain is the result of the collaboration of the    Union de Ejidos de la Selva, a peasant organization, and the Vinculo y Dessarrollo    civil association. Together these organizations have developed five successful    coffee shops in Mexico City and have worked to develop the reputation of Caf&eacute;    de la Selva among urban consumers. The origin of the coffee itself is what makes    Caf&eacute; de la Selva so special. By controlling the entire vertical chain    of coffee production, the Union de Ejidos de la Selva is able to improve indigenous    farmer income and self-sufficiency. With over 20 years of experience, the Union    collaborates with 1,250 families in 42 communities to ensure the adoption of    better soil management and environmental practices. By using certified organic    techniques, farmers are able to control erosion, limit pollution, create a healthier    environment for other species, and produce coffee that meets the demands of    the most discriminating consumers</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nicaragua    <br>   Campesino to Campesino Programme of the Municipality of Siuna (PCaC)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PCaC was founded    in 1992 with the goal of controlling a rapidly expanding agricultural frontier,    achieving food security, and restoring deforested areas in Nicaragua's Siuna    municipality. To meet these goals, PCaC promotes the use of leguminous plants    and green fertilizers as cover crops. This works to stabilize the soil and leads    the way for crop diversification and improved land use planning. As a result    of PCaC's work and its network of volunteer "promoters", corn yields in Siuna    have more than doubled and bean production has more than tripled. Adopting improved    agricultural practices has also halted the damaging practices that previously    took a devastating toll on the nearby, species-rich Bosawas Biosphere Reserve.    By helping peasant families develop a series of forestry activities that help    to protect biodiversity, including reforestation projects that planted at least    1,000 trees, PCaC is actively conserving the species-rich forestlands of the    region. Through its work, PCaC has helped to replace destructive agricultural    practices with sustainable systems that ensure food security, increase family    incomes, and protect local biodiversity.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PERU    <br>   Ese'eja Community of Infierno</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the emergence    of global environmental awareness, there has also been a surge of interest in    sustainable tourism. In Peru, a partnership between a private enterprise, Rainforest    Expeditions, and local indigenous people provides a model for how ecotourism    can be used to solve problems of biodiversity loss and poverty in the developing    world. Building on a commitment to conservation made 25 years ago by the local    Ese'eja people, the partnership has constructed Posada Amazonas, a 30-bedroom    lodge that serves as the base for responsible tourism and conservation activities.    Since 1998, work has also been undertaken to protect species such as giant river    otters, macaws and Harpy eagles. With a proportion of revenues invested in local    conservation and development projects, the local environment also benefits from    this collaboration. Critically, an annual profit of US$35,000 was paid to the    community in 2001 and wages from employment have increased mean family income    by 38% since 1998.</font></p>      <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>World    heritage sites</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Costa Rica    <br>   Talamanca    Initiative</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A collaborative    partnership of three community-focused organizations - Associacion ANAI, APPTA,    and CBTC - the Talamanca Initiative has worked since 1983 to integrate biodiversity    conservation and socio-economic development in the Talamanca region of Costa    Rica. The initiative's biodiversity conservation efforts include establishment    of Gandoca-Manzanillo National Wildlife Refuge, a last sanctuary for the endangered    Manatee, and development of Central America's only permanent raptor migration    monitoring program. To encourage sustainable socio-economic development, the    initiative has promoted crop diversification and organic agriculture, with APPTA's    processing system becoming the largest volume producer and exporter of organic    products in Central America. Since 1991, the initiative has also run a Regional    Training Center and has helped establish 13 local ecotourism ventures. As an    example of the gains that have been made through the initiative's work, income    in villages has risen up to six-fold and communities have been able to engage    in sustainable income generating pursuits that also work to protect their natural    environment.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Guatemala    <br>   Association of Forest Communities of Pet&eacute;n (ACOFOP)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACOFOP is an organization    of community-based groups covering 30 rural villages in the buffer zone of the    Mayan Biosphere Reserve, a 2.1 million-hectare region of international biological    importance. The most innovative aspect of this initiative is that, through ACOFOP,    these communities have assumed responsibility for sustainable management of    resources within the biosphere reserve. Currently, the communities have 437,597    hectares of forests under management plans, of which 241,448 hectares are internationally    certified by the Forest Stewardship Council - the world's largest certified    forest area under community management. As well, the critical work of ACOFOP    helps to limit uncontrolled migration and reduces conflict over natural resources.    ACOFOP also provides badly needed jobs in local communities and vocational and    skills training in the region. Ultimately, the work of ACOFOP has reduced local    poverty, limited deforestation, and replaced a regime of unsustainable exploitation    of biodiversity with an era of sustainable use.</font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>HONDURAS    <br>   Mosquitia Pawisa Agency for the Development of the Honduras    <br>   Mosquitia (MOPAWI)</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Representing several    thousand Miskito, Garifuna, and Mistizo inhabitants of the Honduran Mosquitia,    MOPAWI works to protect habitats ranging from coastal beaches to pine savanna    and primary rainforest. A key outcome of MOPAWI's work has been the recognition    of community land rights, including a 40-year agreement on 68,000 hectares of    broadleaf and pine forest. MOPAWI has also been able to protect some 230,000    hectares of Tawahka ancestral territories through declaration of the Tawahka    Biosphere Reserve. The project also promotes sustainable income generating activities    that allow communities to emerge from poverty without imperiling the species    with which they coexist, including production of organic cacao, ecotourism development,    and responsible forest management. A similarly varied approach has been applied    to conserving biodiversity, with projects to protect leatherback and loggerhead    turtles and the rare green iguana. Importantly, the work of MOPAWI has raised    the awareness of communities to the importance of protecting biological diversity    and has encouraged communities to prevent construction of a dam in the Mesoamerican    Biological Corridor.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>NOTE</b></font></p>      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="back1"></a><a href="#top1">1</a>."Equator    Initiative Partnership/ Equator Prize 2002", UNDP, august 2002 pg. 6- 17</font></p>       </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

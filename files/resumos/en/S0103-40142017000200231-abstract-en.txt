ABSTRACT This work presents Mário de Andrade&#8217;s strong relationship with two fields intrinsic in his production: musicology and the French culture that permeated his intellectual trajectory from the very beginning. We analyze here some chronicles included in Música, doce música (Music, sweet music), which reveal the Brazilian writer&#8217;s vision and particular position towards French music, musicians and musical critics with whom he establishes a dialogue on equal terms.

The values and roles for each gender are not socially recognized in an impartial way. It is a cultural construction that seeks, relying on the differences and, on a dichotomous hierarchy and power, to establish an inequality that reinforces the supremacy of masculinity as a value. In patriarchal culture - as a trend - men tend to be the most violent, and women to have a behavior of dependence and docility. Therefore the coupling relationships associated with fantasies of love are a space of power and are constantly harassed by experiences of servitude and domination. Difference - hierarchy - inequality - discrimination - violence, invisible feedback circuit that culture reedits daily and which expresses itself from psychological form to extreme damages primarily toward women on the amorous relationship.

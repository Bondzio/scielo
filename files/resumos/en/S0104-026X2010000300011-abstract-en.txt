The articulation of a queer epistemology allows us to think about textuality as a place of dramatization of a politic fiction that questions the heteronormative patterns of sex and gender, and proposes a strategy of resistance based both on bodies and pleasures and on politics of representation and reinvention of masculinities and femininities. Through the principles of narratology, it is studied in which way (or ways) the narrative is configured as a space of negotiation, from a queer perspective, of nationality, sexuality, and gender in the enunciation. In this sense, literature rewrites both the sexual body, seen as the place of individual subjectivity, and the social/ national body, understood as a fiction that balances body and sexual sociabilities. At last, the contradictions and impasses that emerge from literature are analyzed, particularly in which concerns questions of race, class, and gender, as well as the potentialities and problematic points of a queer poetics as a place of cultural intervention, intending the construction and the comprehension of this queer poetics, where new arranges of social legibility are projected in a performative way.

This paper purports to discuss whether the transformations which occurred in Physics (Einstein's Theory of Relativity and Wave Mechanics - Microphysics) have lead knowledge (Science and Philosophy) to acquire a new way of considering the world: contemporaneity. The central issue proposed is to show the relationship between the behaviour of infinitesimal elements, which are the object of Wave Mechanics, and the new concept of power in Foucault. This relation being established, the paper moves on to inquire as to the transformations which have taken place in the field of knowledge and if such transformations have jointly lead us to a new epist&#233;me.

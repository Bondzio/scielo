Sustained by findings in the professional world and, in particular, in the world of education and training the author proposes the concept of action culture as a shared way of organizing the construction of the meaning of activities. This transversal concept of the different forms of action seeks to unite individual and collective aspects, what remains and what changes and the mental and conative aspects in the approach to involvement with action. The concept is inscribed within the broader frame of the creation of tools that are capable of describing the simultaneous construction of the actions of individuals and groups.

This article analyses three works by Mexican painter Frida Kahlo: Las dos Fridas (The Two Fridas), Autorretrato en la frontera entre MÃ©xico y Estados Unidos (Self-Portrait on the Borderline between Mexico and the United States), and Lo que el agua me dio (What the Water Gave Me). Each work is first analyzed separately and then connected with the others. The analysis of the first two is guided by the national/foreign dichotomy present in Kahlo; the analysis of the third shows the overcoming of the dichotomy through the concept of intimate map - in which a feeble and ever-changing territorialization of memory via plastic expression comes to show.

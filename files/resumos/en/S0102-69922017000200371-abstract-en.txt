Abstract The aim of this paper is to analyze the citizen perceptions and the valorization of the implementation of public policies and the performance of the public institutionalization in Chile. For this purpose, we have narrowed down the search universe by interviewing subjects under vulnerable social conditions who are direct &#8216;beneficiaries&#8217; of public policies designed to overcoming poverty and social vulnerability. This study followed the qualitative method and it was conducted in Osorno city located in the Lakes District, Chile. As an overview, this article seeks to discuss the fragmentary nature of the public policies in regard to the internalization of the assistential logic and the neoliberal principle of the individual responsibility.

AbstractStarting from ethnographic exercises, the text presents diasporic experiences of women mourners that when migrating from northeastern Brazil to &#8220;Amazon Bragantina&#8221;, in Par&#225; State, from the 1950s, whose lives were marked by the initiation process with the entities of the Brazilian enchant (Prandi, 2004). On overnight trips to cemeteries, transfiguration, physical transport, clairvoyance and wanderings in animal bodies, winds and waters, these mourners revisited &#8220;worlds&#8221; and ancient &#8220;times&#8221;, going to talk with shamans and &#8220;powerful&#8221; chanters of Maranh&#227;o, Para&#237;ba, Piau&#237; and Cear&#225;, letting people see and delighted in other senses of displacement. The belief in the ability of entities to monitor persons holding the &#8220;gift of praying&#8221; to the Par&#225;, as well as continually transitioning these sites, nomadizando up (Deleuze; Guattari, 1995) between &#8220;there&#8221; and &#8220;here&#8221;, constitute the phenomenon of &#8220;diaspora of the enchanted&#8221; (Brah, 2011; Hall, 1999, 2009). Living with these women teaches, among other things, to defend conceptions of meetings and displacements of cultures that perceive the radical otherness of the cosmology of the human sciences, even when one believes this faithfully situated in places of departure, passage and arrival of movements, forgetting often it is not the place, but the material and symbolic transits.

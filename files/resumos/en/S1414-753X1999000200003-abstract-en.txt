In this article we analyze the definitions and measures of sustainability. We show that while definitions include an inter-generation element and another of intra-generation equity, most of the measures only consider the former. We explain the methodological reasons for that, as well as demonstrating the possibility of including other criteria -such as social productivity and potential surplus- which explain environmental problems derived from social relations.

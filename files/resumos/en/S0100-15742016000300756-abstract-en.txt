Abstract The article shows the results of a survey which seeks to understand the relationship that students in their final years of elementary school establish with knowledge, in the context of full-time school in the countryside. The theoretical framework are the contributions of Bernard Charlot on the relationship with knowledge. The study was conducted with 67 students from 03 schools in the countryside. The empirical material was produced through the balance of knowledge and interviews. The analysis shows the weight of school learnings and the mismatches between the body and the ways of life in the countryside. The conclusions point to the need for incorporating Rural Education into the full-time schooling debate, and to the appreciation of art, body and movement as valid learnings in expanding the school day.

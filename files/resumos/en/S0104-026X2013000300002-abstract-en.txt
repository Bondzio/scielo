The purpose of this work is to interrogate the phenomenon of delayed maternity from the psychoanalytical perspective. We base our study on two notions: the issue of time, related to the way the feminine body works; and the notion of creation, related to human procreation. Time and creation are two fundamental elements regarding the psychoanalytical concept of sublimation. They both constitute a singular way to approach femininity and particularly maternity as one of its destinies.

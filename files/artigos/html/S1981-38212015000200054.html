<p>This article deals with an issue as yet little explored in the vast literature
					about political participation: the role of corruption in political engagement.
					It investigates whether the coexistence, the values and the perception of
					citizens in relation to corrupt practices and actors have effects on political
					activism, and it verifies the direction in which this is evolving, whether it is
					in the direction of engagement in or withdrawal from politics. The unit of
					analysis is the individual, the geographic sector includes the Americas and the
					Caribbean, and the time frame includes biennial intervals between 2004 and 2012.
					A theoretical discussion and empirical analysis of the data from the Americas
					Barometer is used. Five distinct types of political participation were
					identified: contact with political and governmental actors, community activism,
					partisan and electoral activism, voter turnout and protest activism. The article
					concludes that the experience with corruption and the tolerance for bribe
					increase the chances of engagement in participative activities, going against
					the principal contributions of the specialized literature.</p>

<div id="article-body" class="body">
<p><sup><a href="#B27">Norris (2011)</a></sup> emphasizes that democracy,
			understood both as an ideal to be followed (normative dimension) as well as a type of
			political system (analytical dimension), currently finds itself disseminated around the
			world. Analyzing the adoption of political systems in the past century, <sup><a href="#B25">Moisés (1992)</a></sup> maintains that democracy was the main
			character, agreeing with the term used by <sup><a href="#B29">Pasquino
				(1990)</a></sup> to characterize the political life of the period: "celebration of
			democracy". <sup><a href="#B19">Huntington (1994)</a></sup> emphasizes that,
			from the mid-19<sup>th</sup> until the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, changes
			occurred in non-democratic systems into democratic systems, a movement that he titled
			"waves of democratization". <sup><a href="#B5">Bonifácio (2014)</a></sup>, in
			turn, observes moderate but sustained growth in the democratic character of political
			systems (free countries) over time, in all parts of the world, considering the period
			from the 1970s to the present<sup><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>As for the characteristics of a democratic system, we understand that political
			participation may be characterized as the most voluntary and activist dimension. First,
			because it is grounded in autonomous mobilization, free of legal obligations<sup><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></sup>. Second, related activities are not
			necessarily restricted to a unique environment, which means that they are practiced by
			various social actors in various arenas.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of these characteristics, the number of studies on political
			participation is large. What we attempt in this study, however, is to investigate an
			issue as yet little explored in the specialized literature: the role of corruption in
			the shaping of political engagement. Could the coexistence, the values and the
			perception of citizens in relation to corrupt practices and actors have effects on
			political activism? If so, in what direction is it evolving: in the direction of
			engagement in or withdrawal from politics?</p>
<p>To meet our objectives, we examined studies whose themes approached the research problem
			selected and conducted empirical analyses. As for the final aspect, we used data,
			relevant to American and Caribbean citizens in dozens of countries, from the Americas
				Barometer<sup><a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> (henceforth, AB). Data
			relative to the elections in 2004, 2006-7, 2008, 2010 and 2012 were accessed. Due to the
			size of public and the time period that the set of studies covers, it is possible to
			identify trends about the possible relationship between corruption and political
			participation.</p>
<p>The present study is organized as follows: in the next section, we define political
			participation, select its indicators and analyze its dimensionality. Next, we discuss
			the effects of corruption in individual political orientations and describe their
			indicators. The third part is dedicated to the methodological aspects of the study and
			is followed by the data analysis. We conclude with the final considerations.</p>
<div class="section">
<a name="idm9086784"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Political participation: definition, indicators and dimensionality</p>
<p>The debate about political participation is extensive. There are, for example,
				several views about the environment in which the phenomenon and its dimensionality,
				beyond the repertoire of participatory activities, develop. In <sup><a href="#B8">Brady (1999)</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B7">Borba (2012)</a></sup>
				and <sup><a href="#B5">Bonifácio (2014)</a></sup>, some of the principal
				studies that deal with these issues are approached and the last author emphasizes
				that the unique consensual point among them is the consideration that participation
				is a behavior, an action, and not an attitude, which is something imbued with
				subjective character.</p>
<p>We consider political participation to refer to <em>activities exercised by
					citizens, in several areas, with the objective of influencing the dynamics of
					power</em>. Therefore, we understand that participating means taking part in
				something (<sup><a href="#B14">FIALHO, 2008</a></sup>), that the phenomenon
				is expressed by activities and that it may develop in various arenas seeking, in
				either a conflictive or cooperative way, to influence the distribution of power
					(<sup><a href="#B31">REIS, 2000</a></sup>).</p>
<p>From this definition, it is possible to select empirical indicators (<a href="#t1">Chart 01</a>). Two considerations, however, are shown to be
				essential. The first refers to the extent of the participatory dynamic. We do not
				incorporate the conception that its results can contribute to a structural change in
				the State (<sup><a href="#B30">PIZZORNO, 1975</a></sup>) because the
				occurrence of revolutionary movements is seen infrequently throughout history and
				what we seek to study are the most common movements. Second, we include among the
				indicators only activities of an unequivocal political nature. Thus, we leave aside
				certain groups and associations usually linked to political participation, such as
				women's and religious groups, for example. The manner in which the AB questionnaire
				treats the relationship of these organizations does not permit the interpretation
				that engagement is necessarily linked to political issues.</p>

<p>From the selection of political participation indicators, we investigate the nature
				of the dimensionality of the phenomenon: do they express a unique dimension, or can
				they be grouped into different dimensions, constituting specific modalities?</p>
<p>Performing the exploratory factor analysis (<a href="#t2">Table
					01</a>), we distinguish <em>prima facie</em> three modes of political
				participation: <em>contact with political and governmental actors, community
					activism </em>and<em> electoral and partisan activism</em>. The
				first mode expresses direct contact between representative and represented, without
				the presence of demonstrations or related activities that aim to exert public
				pressure. However, in the way that these issues are placed in the questionnaire, it
				is not possible to discern whether the contact occurs in an individual or collective
				manner, nor the nature of the issues involved. Community activism, in turn, denotes
				action on small-scale political issues of local scope. It aims to influence policies
				and actors that handle the specific problems of a particular community. Electoral
				and partisan activism includes activities that aim to influence electoral results,
				notably the national discussions, activities and organizations included within this
				mode.</p>

<p>More detailed analyses of the data indicate the existence of two more modes of
				political participation: <em>voter turnout </em>and<em> protest
					activism</em>. The greater value of the coefficient of the variable related
				to voting has a low level, not surpassing the 0.450 ceiling. This result indicates
				that the variable is not linked to any specific group, that it constitutes a
				specific segment. Furthermore, this interpretation converges with the contributions
				of <sup><a href="#B39">Verba, Nie and Kim (1987)</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B26">Norris (2002)</a></sup>, and <sup><a href="#B6">Booth and Seligson (2009)</a></sup>, who claim the existence of a specific
				mode of political participation, voter turnout. The statistical coefficient of the
				variable related to protest shows a similar characteristic in the first four rounds.
				However, in 2012, with the inclusion of the variable related to signing petitions
				and the questions in the questionnaire, both variables show expressive values
				(greater than 0.7) in a unique factor, thus constituting what we call protest
				activism.</p>
<p>These results further strengthen the findings of the studies such as those by Verba,
				Nie and Kim (1987), <sup><a href="#B26">Norris (2002)</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B6">Booth and Seligson (2009)</a></sup> and Teorell, Torcal
				and Montero (2007), that assert the multidimensional nature of political
				participation. Faced with so much evidence related to the various modes of political
				participation, we consider it inappropriate to conceptualize it as a single
				phenomenon, restricted to the governmental and electoral environment, as Milbrath
				(1965) understood. Instead, our empirical assessment allows us to advance five types
				of political participation, as shown in <a href="#t3">Chart
					02</a>.</p>

<a name="idm8772864"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Corruption and political behavior</p>
<p>Corruption has long occupied a good part of the attention of scientists in several
				areas. <sup><a href="#B21">Lipset and Lenz (2002)</a></sup> assert that the
				explanation for such interest lies in its ubiquity in complex societies. Perhaps it
				is due to this characteristic that <sup><a href="#B13">Euben
					(1989)</a></sup> understood that the conceptual history of corruption is uncertain.
				According to the author, the term was used in two distinct contexts: to refer to a
				specific human activity – as, for example, bribery – or in a more general sense of
				destruction, devastation or adulteration of an organic material. It may be
				considered, therefore, that the word has negative connotations and is assimilated
				into notions of decay, disintegration and degeneration.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#B15">Filgueiras (2008)</a></sup> claims it is a mistake to
				write about a political theory of corruption as there is no consensus regarding its
				meaning in the tradition of Western political thought. The most appropriate would
				be, therefore, to speak about approaches to corruption. From studies such as that of
				Heidenheimer, Johnston and Levine (1989), it is possible to conceptualize three main
				approaches to corruption: (01) one that considers it an infractional act, which
				opposes or transcends laws and official norms (<sup><a href="#B23">MANZETTI and WILSON, 2009</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B28">NYE,
					1967</a></sup>); (02) another, which conceptualizes it as a calculated behavior
				that benefits the corruptor, given the specific opportunities of the context of
				which the action is part (<sup><a href="#B32">ROSE-ACKERMAN,
				1999</a></sup>) and, finally, (03) there is a perspective that treats corruption as
				intimately linked to the normative system in effect in every society (<sup><a href="#B9">CALERA, 1997</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B15">FILGUEIRAS, 2008</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B36">SEÑA, 1989</a></sup>;
					<sup><a href="#B38">VALDÉS, 1995</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The indicators of corruption that we use will follow, in part, these three prevailing
				views of the phenomenon. We seek to verify the proximity of the citizen with the
				phenomenon that can vary from his (01) experience with situations of requests for
				bribes (what we call experience with corruption) to (02) tolerance for bribes
				(tolerance for corruption), and (03) perception of corruption among public officials
				(perception of corruption). So, we have a measure of <em>coexistence</em>
				with corrupt acts, a <em>value</em> related to a specific act of corruption
				and a <em>general perception</em> of the incidence of corruption within a
				specific group, respectively<sup><sup>4</sup></sup>. We do not use macro-level
				measures of corruption.</p>
<p>Regarding the frequency of these indicators (<a href="#t4">Table
					02</a>), we note that the percentages of the aggregate experience with
				situations of requests for bribes among public officials and police are very close
				in each one of the five rounds of the AB: about 11%. Stability in the percentages is
				also present in the perception of corruption. In all rounds, about 80% of the
				citizens think that corruption is common or very common among public officials. The
				percentages of tolerance for bribes are distributed in a somewhat distinct way,
				gradually decreasing during the period analyzed. Despite the lack of data for the
				2004 round, we identify a drop of approximately 04% from the 2006-7 round to the
				2008 round, and of 06% from this round to the 2010 round, stabilizing from this year
				to 2012.</p>

<p>From these results, we consider that Americans and Caribbeans hold a strongly
				negative view of the integrity of the actions of public officials, since 08 out of
				every 10 perceive the incidence of corrupt behavior among this group of workers.
				Furthermore, there seems to be a strong value – increasingly stronger over the years
				– against the acceptance of payment of bribes for things to happen or to work. There
				is, however, the risk that this type of response is conditioned by a socially
				desirable behavior. The scenario of the experience with corruption, in turn, is very
				distinct. Only 01 out of every 10, approximately, report having experienced
				situations of requests for bribes in their contacts with public officials and
				police.</p>
<p>The differences in percentages make sense, since the first two measures have a
				subjective character and the last one is more objective, indicating the fact of an
				actual occurrence. Due to the difference in the nature of the variables and the
				percentage differences, we believe that the magnitude of their effects on
				participative engagement can be distinguished.</p>

<a name="idm8718144"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The role of corruption in political behavior</p>
<p>The contradictory views about the role of corruption in the political sphere are also
				present in the specialized literature. For around at least seven decades, scientists
				have argued both its possible negative as well as its positive effects.</p>
<p>When the debated issue is the consequences of corruption for the political system,
					<sup><a href="#B35">Seligson (2002)</a></sup> identifies, among those
				scientists classified by him as "functionalists", the view that corruption would
				have a positive role for countries with authoritarian political regimes, since it
				would serve as an instrument to untie the knots of the state bureaucracy. It would
				be a kind of lubricant that makes the machines function. <sup><a href="#B18">Huntington (1968)</a></sup>, for example, suggests that corruption may be
				a way of overcoming the traditional norms and the bureaucratic regulations that
				hamper economic development. Moreover, it would enable a more consistent tie between
				the citizenry and the governments. It would contribute, therefore, to the stability
				of the political system.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after the continuous process of democratization of countries,
				especially after the "third wave of democratization" (<sup><a href="#B19">HUNTINGTON, 1994</a></sup>), the considerations of the role of corruption
				in the system and in the political behavior begin to change connotation. It became
				common to consider it as a phenomenon whose consequences are negative for the
				stability and quality of the political system. Authors like <sup><a href="#B11">Doig and McIvor (1999)</a></sup> and <sup><a href="#B12">Doig
					and Theobald (2000)</a></sup>, for example, suggest that the high rate of
				perception of corruption is related to the low level of institutional trust. This
				favors the possibility of damage to the stability of the political system. <sup><a href="#B35">Seligson (2002)</a></sup>, in turn, identifies, among
				those "victimized by corruption", the lowest levels of support for the democratic
				political regime as well as the lowest levels of interpersonal trust, having
				non-victimized citizens as the comparison. <sup><a href="#B10">Della
					Porta (2000)</a></sup> provides empirical evidence that relates corruption to the
				perception of deficient performance of governments.</p>
<p>Focusing on the field of study about political behavior, we consider that relatively
				recent studies are fairly consensual in indicating the adverse effects of corruption
				on the attitudes and behaviors understood as civic.</p>
<p>From <sup><a href="#B40">Warren's (2012)</a></sup> perspective, corruption
				undermines the inclusive nature of political processes, such as the relationship
				between representatives and represented, because it compromises the power of the
				vote and the voice of citizens who aim to influence collective decisions, removing
				the power and the resources from the public arena to partial relationships,
				individual and private. As a consequence, it weakens democratic legitimacy due to
				the exclusion of citizens from the decisions which affect them. Moreover, corruption
				affects democratic culture, the author emphasizes. If corruption spreads, the
				citizens gradually lose faith in the process of public decision making – seeing it
				as not publicly available and justifiable – and, in consequence, it is likely that
				they will become increasingly cynical regarding public discourse and deliberation.
				From these considerations, <sup><a href="#B40">Warren (2012)</a></sup>
				suggests that corruption enables the reduction of the horizon of collective actions,
				shrinking the sphere of democracy in this field.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#B40">Warren's (2012)</a></sup> and <sup><a href="#B17">Hirschman's (1983)</a></sup> ideas are close. This author looks to socio
				psychological aspects for the explanation for the cyclical involvement of the
				individual in activities related to the public (individual identified as "citizen")
				and private (individual identified as "consumer") spheres. Corruption is important
				for understanding the disengagement of the "citizen" in activities from the public
				sphere, activities that are related to political activism in its varied forms.
				Acceptance and immersion in corrupt acts may be understood as reactions to a change
				of preference: the loss of satisfaction through the action of public interest
				becomes compensated by material gains arising from corruption. Persistent immersion
				in corrupt acts leads individuals to think that public activities are vile by nature
				and, thus, what was initially a reaction of discontent with the public sphere
				becomes a determinant of additional and profound discontent that, in turn, prepares
				the setting for more corruption. At the end of the process, the public spirit is
				completely eliminated. Under these conditions, corruption may provide the "citizen"
				with a rapid transition back to its role as "consumer".</p>
<p><sup><a href="#B17">Hirschman's (1983)</a></sup> study is perhaps the only
				one that relates, even though in a strictly theoretical way, corruption with
				political participation. We do not find studies in the specialized literature that
				have this theme in sight. We do identify, however, studies that associate the
				experience and perception of corruption with political attitudes. The results of
				these studies help us to hypothesize the relationships in a study and develop the
				empirical analysis.</p>
<p>In <sup><a href="#B34">Seligson's (2001</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B35">2002</a></sup>) studies, the objectives are similar: to analyze whether
				the experience with corruption is associated with diffuse support for the democratic
				political regime. For the author, there are two main motives for studying such a
				relationship. First, the high incidence of corruption in Latin American: several
				countries in the region show the highest rates in the index of perception of
				corruption of the International Transparency, and the data of the
					<em>International Crime Victim Survey</em> indicate that a Latin
				American citizen has about fifteen times greater chance of experiencing corruption
				than a citizen from Western Europe. Second, the author cites the extensive history
				of political instability in the region.</p>
<p>In Seligson's first study, the investigation is limited to Nicaragua and used data
				from two opinion surveys, carried out in 1996 and 1998, the latter performed after a
				national campaign in favor of a more efficient public administration. The author
				performed various statistical tests and, in all of them, he found association
				between higher levels of experience with corruption and lower levels of support for
				the democratic regime. In the 2002 study, Seligon expanded the analyzed cases – El
				Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Paraguay – and used another data source, the AB,
				from 2004. The results are the same: the greater the experience with corruption, the
				lower the democratic legitimacy. This study also focuses on interpersonal trust,
				understood as a facilitator for forming the deep and lasting civil associations that
				are vital to the constitution of trust in the political system as a whole. Also, in
				this issue, corruption presents adverse effects; that is, the author verifies
				association between higher levels of experiences with corruption and lower rates of
				interpersonal trust.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#B34">Seligson's (2001</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B35">2002</a></sup>) studies show that the greater the experience with
				situations of requests for bribes, the more negative is the view of the citizens
				with respect to the democratic institutions and processes and the levels of trust
				are also lower. That is, experience with corruption contributes to the low
				attachment to the democratic political regime and to the lower predisposition to
				associativism.</p>
<p>In <sup><a href="#B41">Zéphyr (2008)</a></sup> and <sup><a href="#B33">Salinas and Booth (2011)</a></sup>, the objective is also in the
				relationship between experience with corruption and democratic legitimacy, but the
				analysis is broader as it includes citizens from a larger number of countries. The
				authors use data from the 2006-07 and 2008 rounds, respectively, of the AB. <sup><a href="#B41">Zéphyr (2008)</a></sup> uses two measures of democratic
				legitimacy and, in both cases, the results show that higher levels of experience
				with corruption are linked to lower levels of democratic legitimacy. Salinas and
				Booth (2001) use a wide range of explanatory variables, among them, the experience
				with situations of requests for bribe, and the perception of corrupt behavior among
				public servants to explain particular democratic attitudes, namely (01) expressed
				preference for democracy, (02) the support for basic democratic participation
				rights, and (03) the tolerance toward contestatory forms of political participation.
				The authors identify distinct relationships between the two variables for corruption
				with all three variables being explained: experience with corruption shows, in all
				cases, a negative association with democratic attitudes; on the other hand, the
				perception of corruption shows a positive association with democratic attitudes.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#B4">Bohn (2012)</a></sup> understands that, different from
				autocratic systems, the legitimacy of democratic systems derives from the mass
				support for its principal processes such as free and fair elections,
				institutionalized freedoms and rights, as well as transparency and accountability in
				public institutions. The presence of corruption in the democratic environment
				vitiates the interactions between the citizen and the State, and potentiates the
				reduction of trust and satisfaction of individuals with the system and its primary
				institutions, that author suggests. <sup><a href="#B4">Bohn
					(2012)</a></sup> directs his investigation from these considerations, analyzing the
				role of the perception and the experience with corruption in the satisfaction of the
				citizens with actually-existing democracy, using data from the 2010 AB. The
				association between the two variables for corruption with satisfaction with
				actually-existing democracy are similar in that they are both negative. That is, the
				higher the levels of experience with and perception of corruption, the lower the
				satisfaction with democracy. However, in the relationship between experience with
				corruption and satisfaction with democracy, the intensity of the association reaches
				a low level and there is no statistical significance.</p>
<p>Although aiming at explaining different types of political orientations, all studies
				examined show the same finding: the proximity to corruption – whether due to
				experience with corrupt acts or due to the perception of its existence at a high
				level –undermines the democratic disposition of the citizens. Thus, we hypothesize
				that having experience with situations of requests for bribes, being tolerant for
					bribes<sup><a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a></sup> and having a high
				perception of corruption among public officials, increases the chances of
				non-engagement in all participative activities.</p>
<p>Although it is important to consider the existence of various and contradictory
				motivations for the adherence to each one of the modalities<sup><a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a></sup>, we do not discriminate different hypotheses for
				each of them because we see no differences in the process of political engagement,
				given that it is always voluntary and activist. Moreover, the studies that we
				approach in this topic indicate clearly an adverse effect of corruption on different
				types of political attitudes (adherence to democracy, tolerance for competing forms
				of participation, political trust etc.). These two questions serve us as references
				for constructing a single, general hypothesis about the relationship between
				corruption and political participation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idm8671552"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Methodological strategies</p>
<p>As noted above, the empirical analysis rests exclusively on treatment of the data
				extracted from the AB, a set of opinion surveys applied among citizens from several
				countries in the Americas and the Caribbean, conducted by the <em>Latin American
					Public Opinion Project </em>(LAPOP), of <em>Vanderbilt
					University</em>, coordinated by Professor Mitchell Seligson. This choice is
				based on several criteria. One of them is the richness of the questionnaire. The AB
				contains dozens questions about political participation and also addresses the
				citizen's proximity with corruption. In addition, it covers an uninterrupted time
				period of about a decade, with the application of biennial surveys. Finally, the
				samples of surveys conducted in each country are calculated in such a way as to
				permit the generated data to be representative of the full population.</p>
<p>The sample size varies from country to country. For this reason, we always consider
				all the statistical tests performed with the variable <em>weight1500</em>, a
				procedure that guarantees that the sample of all of the countries contains the same
				number of cases, 1500.</p>
<p>In the first topic of this study, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis with
				the polychoric correlation matrix, the most appropriate when the variables used are
				binary and categorical. The results of this test permitted the creation of political
				participation indices, one for each modality identified. The value of "zero" in the
				indices indicates no participation, and values greater than or equal to "one"
				indicate participation, but we aggregate all these last values into just one
				category. We chose this procedure because we observed that the values, separately
				(categorical and not binary), have always appeared greatly inferior to the totality
				of non-participation cases, requiring an aggregation which, if not done, could
				compromise the quality of the results of the statistical tests. From this procedure,
				we get a more balanced distribution of frequencies possible between participation
				and non-participation.</p>
<p>Due to the choice about the structure of the political participation indices, we
				ruled out the use of two types of regression: linear and multinomial logistic. The
				first has, as a pre-requisite, the continuous nature of the response variable, and
				the second requires more than two categories in the response variable. The binary
				logistic regression test, which requires the binary response variable, appeared to
				be the more appropriate for the data that we have.</p>
<p>Regarding the variables for corruption, it is important to emphasize that the data
				from the AB have some technical limitation in the measurements. The most important
				of these is related to the experience with corruption. We note, in the data from the
				2012 round, the lack of questions about requests for bribes in some situations for
				the citizens of Canada<sup><a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a></sup>. Moreover,
				in the same round, the filter question is not applied to each one of the situations
				of requests for bribes in a considerable number of countries. For example, before
				being asked if the interviewee had to pay a bribe in order to have his petition
				recognized in the municipality, he is asked if he sent any petition to the
				municipality during the last year. The application of these filter questions is not
				uniform for the citizens of all countries in which the survey is conducted. In some
				cases, they were even included in the questionnaires. For the other rounds, the
				problems persist and are amplified: despite the existence of the filter questions in
				the questionnaires, they are not included in the database. Moreover, there are high
				percentages of non-responses (missing values) in the response categories for the
				variables about experience with situations of requests for bribe in all five
					rounds<sup><a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>Due to these limitations, we use only two variables about experience with corrupt
				acts: experience with the situation of requiring bribes by some police and official
				public. None of the limitations identified above are present in these variables.
				There are also limitations in the case of the variables for intolerance and the
				perception of corruption, although they are of lesser magnitude. In both, there is a
				lack of application of the question in particular countries and in some rounds<sup><a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>In the regressions<sup><a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a></sup> (table 3), the
				response variables follow the findings coming from the factor analysis, described in
					<a href="#t2">Table 01</a> and <a href="#t3">Chart 02</a>. The only difference is the segmentation of the
				voter turnout in two variables, the indicators of compulsory voting and optional
				voting. Within the scope of the explanatory variables, we use the three variables
				for corruption, but also variables of interactions with these variables among
				themselves and among each one of them with the continuous variable for schooling. We
				also include indicators of socioeconomic and demographic conditions in the
				regression models as control variables. Moreover, we use the fixed effects<sup><a href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a></sup> for the indicator variables for
				countries – not shown in the tables below, due to the space limitation – and the
				variable placed as reference, for each round and each mode of participation, is that
				which shows the greatest percentages of frequency in the corresponding index<sup><a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>The regression tests were performed using progressive incorporation models. Models
				01, 02 and 03 each encompass only one indicator variable for corruption: perception,
				tolerance and experience, respectively. Due to space limitation, the pertinent
				results of each one of these models are listed in only one column, for each round.
				Model 04, in turn, comprises all the indicator variables for corruption; and, Model
				05 is the most complete, containing all the variables of the previous model plus
				those relative to socioeconomic conditions and the variables of interaction<sup><a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></sup>. In all five models (<a href="#f01">table 3</a>), the variables for the countries are
				present. It is worth noting that the data from 2004 are not used in the regressions
				due to the absence of the indicator variable for tolerance for corruption in that
				round.</p>

</div>
			</p>
<p>In addition to analyzing the relationships between the explanatory variables with the
				response variable, we also analyzed the adjustment of the models (predictive
				capacity). Several coefficients may be useful in this way, as, for example, those
				obtained from the Chi-square test, the Wald test, the Chi-square test of likelihood
				ratio, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the Pseudo R-squared of Cox and Snell,
				Nagelkerke, Effron and McFadden (adjusted or not adjusted). Even without consensus
				among specialists, it is common to use the coefficients of the Chi-square<sup><a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a></sup>, Chi-square of likelihood
					ratio<sup><a href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a></sup> and MacFadden's Pseudo
					R-squared<sup><a href="#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a></sup> tests. Therefore,
				we included them in the models.</p>
<p>Our analyses of the degree of adjustment of the model, following the assumptions of
				the test, only took into account comparisons between nested models, in this case
				Models 04 and 05. We observe that the values of the Chi-square and of the Chi-square
				with likelihood ratio of the more complete models always surpass the critical value,
				when compared with the values relative to the four models. These results enable us
				to claim that the progressive addition of variables to the models contributed to the
				predictive capacity thereof.</p>
<p>The tests of predicted values contributed to the deepening of the analyses of the
				relationship between corruption and political participation. The tests performed
				help to better understanding the relationship of the interactions between the
				variables for corruption (represented by straight lines) and the propensity for
				participation (y-axis). In all cases, we also used the continuous variable for
				schooling (x-axis)<sup><a href="#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a></sup>.</p>
<p>For the tests of logistic regression and predicted values, only part of the data are
				found in the article, in order to avoid an excessive number of pages. In both cases,
				only the data from 2012 are presented, for the community activism modality (<a href="#f01">Table 03</a> and <a href="#f03">Graph 02</a>), in addition to the predicted values in relation to general

<a name="idm8624848"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The role of corruption in political participation among Americans and Caribbeans:
				data analysis</p>
<p>Citizens who have experience with corruption are more likely to engage in
				participative activities than those who do not have this type of experience. The
				magnitude of the association between this variable and the variables relative to
				political participation always appears greater among all the indicators of
				corruption, and also always checks for statistical significance. Consistency in the
				direction of the associations of the five models is also notable, considering all
				modalities of participation and all rounds, even when variables of socioeconomic
				conditions are inserted into the models. Additionally, we can consider that the
				results support the interpretation that the negative relationship between corruption
				and political participation is not confirmed. That is, contrary to what found by the
				literature thus far, experience with corruption appears to increase the likelihood
				of political engagement of Americans and Caribbeans.</p>
<p>Such results are valid for nearly all modalities of participation, except those
				relative to voter turnout. In the case of compulsory voting, there is an inverse
				direction in the sense of association, predominantly the negative effects for
				participation. In the case of optional voting, the direction of association is
				variable, predominantly in the positive sense, except for the complete models from
				the 2006-07 and 2008 rounds. In both of those cases, statistical significance occurs
				in the smaller part of the associations.</p>
<p>The results for the effects of tolerance for corruption on political participation
				are similar to those described above. In cases of contact with political and
				governmental actors, of community activism, of electoral and partisan activism and
				of protest activism, we observed that those tolerant of bribes are more likely to
				engage in these participative activities than those intolerant of it. The main
				difference between these results and those found in the relationship between
				experience and participation falls in the intensity of the associations. There are
				always smaller modular values, and also the statistical significance is not always
				present in all the models created. Once again, therefore, the proposition advancing
				a negative association is not confirmed since tolerance for corruption increases the
				likelihood of political engagement of Americans and Caribbeans.</p>
<p>In the two cases of the voter turnout modality, considering compulsory voting and
				optional voting, the effects of this tolerance are variable. In the first case, the
				negative direction of association predominates in the complete model for the first
				two rounds, and in the negative direction for all models in the last two rounds. In
				the second case, we observed the negative direction of association in all models
				from the 2006-07 and 2008 rounds, and in the positive direction for the more
				complete models of the 2010 and 2012 rounds.</p>
<p>Regarding the effects of the perception of corruption, we observed a prevailing
				negative direction of association in cases of contact with political and
				governmental actors and of electoral and partisan activism. That is, those having a
				high or moderate perception of corruption among public officials are less likely to
				engage in these modalities of political participation than those having no or little
				perception thereof. In relation to community activism, protest activism and voter
				turnout (compulsory voting), the direction of the associations is variable,
				predominantly in the positive direction, sometimes in the negative direction,
				considering all models and rounds. Differing from most of the results, voter turnout
				(optional voting) prevails in the positive direction, but with no statistical
				significance for several models, mainly in the complete models. This panorama makes
				it difficult to identify any trend of association between the perception of
				corruption and political activism in these cases. Therefore, we do not suggest any
				response, neither corroborating nor refuting, to the propositions under
				scrutiny.</p>
<p>In relation to the variables of interaction (profiles which aggregate variables about
				corruption and also the variable for schooling), it is not possible to identify any
				trend in their association with any of the modalities of political participation.
				The direction of the association and of the modular values of the effects varies
				greatly, in addition to there being few statistically significant cases.</p>
<p>Due to this difficulty with interpreting the data via logistic regression, we
				performed tests of predicted values that relate profiles constructed from the
				variables about corruption (identified by straight lines) to the propensity for
				engagement in participative activities (y-axis) and levels of schooling
					(x-axis)<sup><a href="#fn18"><sup>18</sup></a></sup>. In <a href="#f02">Graph 01</a>, we constructed combinations of variables about
				corruption and we used an index which aggregates all the participative activities.
				In the other graphs, referring to each one of the modalities of political
				participation (only <a href="#f03">Graph 02</a>, regarding
				community activism, is resent in the text), there is the illustration of the
				propensity for political engagement among those close to and those not close to
				corruption, in the three measures (experience, tolerance and perception).</p>
<p>In a general way, we identify three main trends in the results: (01) independently of
				the characteristics of the profile, with greater propensity for participation, in
				most of the cases<sup><a href="#fn19"><sup>19</sup></a></sup> there is a
				presence of experience with corruption; and (02) in none of the cases is the profile
				that indicates absence of proximity with corruption the one with the greater
				propensity for participation. On the contrary, it always figures in intermediate or
				final positions. Finally, we can emphasize that, in all profiles, (03) there is an
				increased propensity for participation as the level of schooling increases. That is,
				independent of the proximity of the citizen to corruption, schooling always raises
				the propensity to participate.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that, in every modality of political participation (except
				those relative to voter turnout), the differences in the propensity to participate
				are greater among those with and those without experience with corruption, compared
				with the opposing profiles of other indicators of corruption. From these
				observations, we consider that experience with corruption is the indicator that best
				discriminates participative behavior among Americans and Caribbeans.</p>

<p>The present study provides new insights about the relationship between corruption and
				political participation in the Americas and the Caribbean. It extends the time
				period and the number of cases than previous studies as well as it brings new
				aspects to the study of this subject. Its results reinforce the necessity, advanced
				by specialized literature, to understand the phenomenon as plural and no longer as
				singular. That is, we believe that it is more appropriate that we speak of
				"political participations" rather than "political participation". Moreover, it shows
				the necessity to analyze voter turnout aside from other modalities of participation,
				since the results of its associations with the explanatory variables were shown to
				be highly discordant.</p>
<p>Booth and Seligon’s (2009) study might be the first one that dealt, in a more
				comprehensive way, with the dimensionality of political participation in the
				Americas and the Caribbean, using restricted data from the 2004 round of the AB. The
				modalities of political participation they found are similar to those identified by
				us, although there are some differences in the statistical techniques used and the
				time period analyzed. We understand that the similarities in the results enable us
				to state that the logic of political participation, in the context analyzed,
				revolves around five sets of activities, as follows: (01) contact with political and
				governmental actors, (02) community activism, (03) electoral and partisan activism,
				(04) voter turnout and (05) protest activism.</p>
<p>Additionally, this study revealed that that the frequency of experience with
				corruption and the perception of corruption are shown to be stable from 2004 on,
				although with very different magnitudes. However, tolerance for corruption, which
				expresses a value, has diminished throughout the same period. However, the available
				data do not allow us to investigate whether this is a result of a change in values
				or just a consequence of a socially desirable position of the respondent during the
				conduct of the research.</p>
<p>Regarding the possible relationship between corruption and political participation,
				our results allow to advance that tolerance for and experience with corruption
				increase the likelihood of participation, contrary to what previous studies have
				found. Nevertheless, the intensity of the associations is stronger and the presence
				of statistical significance is more numerous in the case of experience with
				corruption. As for the perception of corruption, the results appear highly varied,
				making it difficult to identify any trend.</p>
<p>The results relative to experience with corruption give us a glimpse of the existence
				of a relationship and not of a mere association with the modalities of
				participation, with the exception of those relative to voter turnout. The same could
				be stated regarding schooling, with the difference that it applies to any modality.
				Our results indicate that the experience with situations of bribes have a central
				role in the political engagement of Americans and Caribbeans. Such indications
				enable us to suggest that experience with corruption is the most appropriate
				indicator of the phenomenon for discriminating participative behavior.</p>
<p>However, we are aware of some limitations of the present study. We believe that the
				analysis may be refined in future studies by the inclusion, for example, of more
				contextual variables in the statistical tests performed. It would also be
				interesting to analyze particular cases within the universe of the Americas and the
				Caribbean, to verify whether the principle findings of the present study are
				supported. Finally, we think that studies which follow this research problem should
				go one step further: we verified that the greater the experience with and tolerance
				for corruption, the greater the likelihood of political engagement; but, what are
				the mechanisms involved in this relationship? Are politically active individuals who
				experience corruption closely more or less permissive of acts of corruption? In
				other words, are those individuals willing to change the political system so that it
				becomes fairer or in ways that would help them seek material gains from their
				insertion in corrupt networks? In summary, the present study is innovative and
				reaches important conclusions, but it also opens the space for a vast field of
				research.</p>

<a name="fn8"></a><p><sup>8</sup> To exemplify the problems highlighted, we cite the 2012 round which has a total
					of 39000 cases (using the weight "<em>weight1500"</em> which allocates
					1500 cases for each country). In this round, the percentages of missing values
					for the filter question and for the variable that asks about the payment of
					bribe for each one of the following situations are, respectively: the
					municipality (exc11): 36.8% and 22%; workplace (exc13): 36.7% and 48.1%; judge
					(exc14): 36.7% and 36.7%; medical services (exc15): 36.8% and 46.9%; school
					(exc16): 36.7% and 39%. The percentages are high, which interferes with the data
					analysis and are also non-corresponding, which is an error, since only those who
					answered "yes" or "no" to the question of experience with corruption passed
					through the filter question. Thus, the percentage of missing values for both
					variables should be identical. More aspects may be debated about the quality of
					the measurements, but that is not the focus of the present study. For more
					information on this, consult the following studies: <sup><a href="#B1">Abramo (2004, 2005a, 2005b)</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B2">2005a</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B3">2005b</a></sup>), <sup><a href="#B34">Seligson (2001, 2002)</a></sup>, <sup><a href="#B35">2002</a></sup>), <sup><a href="#B41">Zéphyr (2008)</a></sup> and <sup><a href="#B5">Bonifácio

<a name="fn10"></a><p><sup>10</sup> To interpret the regression coefficients in the text, we adopted the "percentage

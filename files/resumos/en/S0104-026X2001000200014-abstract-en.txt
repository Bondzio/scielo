Today, sexuality is considered a matter of public health, and the school is a privileged place for the implementation of public policies that promote children's and adolescents' health. Thus, it has been established, in agreement with the National Curriculum Parameters (PCNs), as a transversal theme in order to disseminate itself throughout the whole pedagogical field and to broaden its effects in a wide range of different areas, including Physical Education. This research analyzes the requirements of sexuality in the PCNs with the aim of identifying the use of the sexuality concept, the historical uniqueness of this proposal and its possible effects at schools, more specifically through Physical Education.

One of the principal means by which agricultural growth affects the level of welfare of the population is the possibility of increasing the food supply, which generally reflects in lower food prices, with important implications on people's diet. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the agricultural productivity of the main items of people's diet and food security of households in metropolitan regions. We used a qualitative choice model, the probit, and data from the Household Budget Surveys (POF, in Portuguese) of 1995-1996, 2002-2003 and 2008-2009 and research Municipal Agricultural Production. There were significant relationships between the level of education of the household head, the presence of persons under 18 years-old in the family and the fact that the per capita income household earning is less than minimum wage and food security. Moreover, the productivity growth of grains, vegetables and fruits was associated with greater likelihood of food security in at least one of the periods analyzed. We conclude that productivity gains are associated with greater household food security, but in low proportions, due to the high influence of particular characteristics, such as education and income.

ABSTRACT From composer CÃ©sar Guerra-Peixe&#8217;s change in aesthetic orientation, at the turn of the 1940s to the 1950s, the article goes on to discuss the relations between compositional technique and folkloric research among the Brazilian composers of that time. The idea that Brazilian music was marked by the &#8220;limitations&#8221; of the country&#8217;s musical milieu serves as a catalyst for the discussion.

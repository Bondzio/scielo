Abstract: This study sought to identify, from the feminist framework, actors and actresses involved / in the national policy on sexual and reproductive rights, underway in Brazil. The choice of this policy as a place of research was due to be a theoretical discussion of space and politics with historical trajectory of at least thirty years in the field of health, carried out by different and diverse social actors in a field of knowledge and practices anchored in considered masculine elements: biomedical and formulation of policies. Based on an Operational Model Analysis of Public Policy proposed by Ara√∫jo Junior (2000), identified context, actors, process and content of the policy taking as a starting point the dialogue with 23 professionals who, during the research focus (management 2003-2006), occupied important places in the formulation and public debate in this field.

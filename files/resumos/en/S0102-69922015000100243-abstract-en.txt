This paper sets forth a reflection over the contributions that Latin American, Chinese and Indian sociologies may offer to the social thinking in the era of worldization of social conflictualities. We propose a multiple dialogue, based on the historicity of the social processes of building social thinking, regarding concepts, as well as the paths of knowledge construction, as having their own groundings that are neither universal, nor homogeneous. They reflect, instead, the recurrence of social struggles, the existence of local contradictions in heterogeneous contexts. We approximate Latin American, Chinese and Indian sociologies by following through this path of epistemological reconstruction under the concept of "epistemology of the South", as in Boaventura de Sousa Santos, and by promoting means to a dialogue amongst multiple practices and knowledges from those three parts of the world.

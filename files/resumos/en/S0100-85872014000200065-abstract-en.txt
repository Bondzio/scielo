The present paper tries to elucidate the uses and senses of the sacred in the                theoretical formulations and intellectual paths of Georges Bataille (1897-1962) and                Michel Leiris (1901-1990) in 1930's Paris. In the midst of the many                aesthetical-political experiences of the time questioning the possible ways of                political action and its connection with art, the Coll&#232;ge de                   Sociologie (1937-1939) stands out, being headed by both authors alongside                Roger Caillois (1913-1978). The group sees the sacred in a twofold articulation: at                one time a depicting concept and at the other a political operator. This idea is the                starting point towards a reflection on the conjugated and original works of Bataille                and Leiris.

This paper analyses the influence of determinant factors (social capital, lifetime of the project and the stages of the Settlement Projects (PA)) in the total income generated in each settlement of Brazil. Although the Settlement Projects have a national methodology, we try to do a regional approach for the different situations observed. Through the analysis can be seen that both east and south of Brazil have a higher number of PAÂ’s established and an active participation of families in the cooperatives, reflecting the level of organization and more education of these families. This fact may be directly influencing the development of these projects, considering that these regions are also shown as the upper incomes.

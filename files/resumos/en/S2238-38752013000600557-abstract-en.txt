Abstract Since the 1980s, a generation of artists and intellectuals has contested the opposition between "high" and "low" culture and has used its media capital to produce TV programs that expresses its new structure of feelings, more attached to the value of cultural diversity, against nationalism and a traditional vision of "people". This generation has found an important institutional and symbolic place in the NÃºcleo Guel Arraes (NGA), of Globo TV. In order to understand this structure of feelings and to point how it echoes and intensifies a cultural change in the Brazilian cultural field, this article is divided in two items that present the structure of feelings embraced by artists and intellectuals sheltered in the NGA and the affirmative visibility of the "periphery", especially in the Globo's television program named Esquenta.

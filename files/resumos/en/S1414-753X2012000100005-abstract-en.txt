This article aims to contribute to the dialogue on public policies related to conservation and restoration of riparian areas in São Paulo, Brazil, considering the possibilities of including social participation in the formulation and implementation of these policies. The research that led to the considerations presented here was based on the analysis of the implementation and results of the Project for the Recovery of Riparian Forests (PRMC). This was a project led by the State Secretariat of Environment of São Paulo (SMA-SP) in order to generate support for the preparation of a long-term program of conservation and restoration of riparian forests in this state. The research method included the analysis of official documents related to the project, qualitative interviews with officials in the SMA-SP and the Department of Agriculture and Food Supply of São Paulo - SAA-SP, the latter being co-responsible for the project's implementation; as well as semi-structured interviews with farmers and representatives of nongovernmental organizations involved in implementing pilot projects during the PRMC. The results show that the difficulties of integration within and between institutions - between the departments of the SMA-SP, and of this institution with the SAA-SP - as well as the lack of prioritization of participation, social mobilization and environmental education in the PRMC, were the main limiting factors for the success of the project within the scope targeted in this paper.

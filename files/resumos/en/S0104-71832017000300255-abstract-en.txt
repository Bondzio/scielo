Abstract: This work is part of a line of research that began in the 1990s whose main objective was to investigate the role of reading and writing in the teaching courses. In this article, I dwell on the longitudinal ethnographic survey data conducted between 2000 and 2004, comparing the ethnographies recently performed with specific focus on preparation of final course monographies. Through ethnographic study, it was observed there was career (Becker) development of students who complained of unfamiliarity with the written culture on the occasion of their entry into higher education. From the data, we can reflect on positive elements to this structure and identify the importance of improving the levels of proficiency in reading and writing in teacher education as a strategic point to overcome the educational problems in Brazil, while we recognize the need to make the profession more financially attractive.

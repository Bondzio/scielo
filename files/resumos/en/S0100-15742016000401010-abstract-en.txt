Abstract This article aims primarily to discuss the Jesuit practice in Brazil in the late XVI and early XVII centuries. To this end, we employ the surveillance tools used by what was known as the Counter-Reformation to present the historical conditions that permeated the Ignatians' activities at the time. A new perspective on the role played by the Jesuits in Brazil is then presented based on documents researched at the Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu and the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Vittorio Emanuelle, both in Rome, sources which have been rarely used so far.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to identify whether there is a relationship between rural and urban poverty levels. For this, it first earned the poverty line for both areas based on the definition of multidimensional poverty, assuming therefore that the deficiencies in health, income, education and housing are fundamental components for measurement of deprivation. The approach to multidimensional poverty indicator was the fuzzy logic, while the dependency analysis between the indicators was developed through the Copula function. The data refer to urban and rural areas of the 5,565 Brazilian municipalities in 2010. On the one hand, it was found that those rural areas in greatest need are present in the Northeast; on the other, in urban areas, the most worrying situation is the Southeast. Finally, the analysis of dependence between indicators suggests a negative correlation, indicating that when rural poverty worsens, that related to urban area becomes milder.

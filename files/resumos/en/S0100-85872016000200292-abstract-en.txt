Abstract The issue of risk has been a dimension of science to explain the threats given from present decisions, the use of technology and its implications for the future. Contrary, the concept of risk in the religious system seems confined to the mere absorption of uncertainty when in fact it produces and communicates risks in different ways. In this text, we approach the ways in which science and religion deal with the problem of water and its future threats to a region that depends on Chapala Lake, in Mexico. We analyze how various religious forms compete with the answers of science to tackle the lake&#8217;s drought. From the Marian Catholic tradition of processions with the image of the Virgin Mary, to the prays of evangelical churches, the rituals of an indigenous group and the energy of New Age groups who seek to heal mother earth. The text tries to understand how science assumes the risk and how religion changes the risk for danger in modern society, within the probability of an ecological catastrophe.

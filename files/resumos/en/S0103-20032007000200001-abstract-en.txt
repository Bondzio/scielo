In order to measure the impact of milk imports upon some macroeconomic variables such as imported quantity and price, domestic price, real gross domestic product (GDP) and exchange rate we specify an econometric model for the import demand for the period january 1991 to december 2003. We implement the model using time series framework. We also analyse the market for milk imports through "back to back"graphic approach. Furthemore we also use te excess demand equation to define the demand for milk imports.

This article addresses the issue of diversity in the women's movement through an assessment of the participation of the Articulação das Mulheres Brasileiras (AMB) in the III World Conference Against Racism. The conditions that determined this participation can be found in the struggles and negotiations that marked the trajectories of women's political organization and of feminist thought in Brazil. For the authors, the debate black women proposed concerning specific conditions of subordination opened up new possibilities for analyzing women's role in production and reproduction. However, these approaches were only incorporated into the practice of the feminist movement during preparation for both the Beijing Conference and Beijing+5. The participation of the AMB in the Durban Conference points out to the increasing recognition of black women's identity, the acknowledgment of diversity and the construction of a political agenda that places the intersection of gender and race discrimination at the center.

The present paper discusses body and gender representations in the media connected to the use of steroids. We took as our subject the content of news and magazines published in 2010, available at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation collection in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our analysis allows us to indicate that the emphasis in the paradigm of a strong body is directed to both men and women and that news and magazines feature a significant role in the dissemination of a hypervirile corporality.

Abstract There are a great number of studies on the Workers' Party (PT), addressing everything from its origin, organization, and internal dynamics to its relationship with the electorate. Over the years, the PT has enjoyed the largest party preference indices vis-Ã -vis other Brazilian political parties, a phenomenon known as petismo. This article proposes examining the other side of this situation: antipetismo or the rejection that a segment of the electorate has toward the PT. We want to know who the antipetista voter is, based on survey data from the 2014 Brazilian Electoral Study (ESEB). Our main goal is to identify and characterize the profile of the antipetista voter using descriptive statistics and establishing a comparison with the antiparty voter. We then use an adjusted logistic regression model to detect the impact of a set of variables on the probability that a respondent identifies as antipetista. The results show that the negative evaluation of President Dilma Rousseff's government performance and the vote for PSDB candidates in the presidential elections are decisive variables in determining a voter to be antipetista.

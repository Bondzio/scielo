This text, based on narratives registered on an "occurrence book" employed by an elementary public school (1st to 4th grades), intends to discuss the level of surveillance exerted by type of disciplinary logic that inspires them, articulating it with a kind of pedagogic tradition, which is strongly attached to the school's routine. The point to be made is that this tradition, supported by ideas that infantilized the children by considering dependency, immaturity and discredit as universal traits of infancy, end up promoting the need of continuous surveillance and control over them by school authorities. The more to survey, more surveillance is in need and more ample the area for transgressions and for the constitution of the undisciplined children.

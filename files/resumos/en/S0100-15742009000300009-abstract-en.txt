This article presents evidences on the relationship between class, race and access to superior education based on data from the 2006 round of the National Household Survey, PNAD. It aims to bridge the knowledge gap on this issue, which exists in spite of the intense public debate over the adoption of policies to promote equitable access to superior education by black and by poor Brazilians. The indicators presented point out the existence of association between class, race, and access to superior education beyond the effects of the relationship between class, race and attainment of secondary education. It is concluded that if the decision - eminently political - about the groups to be benefited by such actions purports to extract its legitimacy from being evidence based, both the black youth and the poor should be contemplated.

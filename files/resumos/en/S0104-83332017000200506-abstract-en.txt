Abstract Based on the analysis of data produced in the framework of Diversidad sexual y convivencia research project, developed between 2013 and 2014 in different Spanish schools, this article reflects on the role of homophobia as a particular form of violence in the construction, reproduction and control of masculinity among young men. I suggest that bullying is a ritualized form of violence with a great social efficacy among adolescents, where homophobia, through fear, invisibilizes and normalizes violence, silence and isolate victims and perpetuates the legitimacy of teasing, insulting and threatening as valid forms of peerÂ´s relationship.

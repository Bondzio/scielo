AbstractThe Brazilian feminist literature has been discussing a number of issues related to law, in particular the meaning and limits of criminal law. This paper aims to reconstruct such debates starting from some key texts in order both, to identify the main problems faced by them and to open new perspectives for the theoretical analysis and to the political practice.

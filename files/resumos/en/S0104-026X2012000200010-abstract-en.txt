From a survey on teens transvestites in the city of Campinas, this paper aims to reflect on theoretical, policitical and methodological issues that involve the theme of gender and sexuality in contemporary society. It will be valued the need to deepen the study on the conventions and social norms than on focusing the individual him/herself. The subjective and bodily question of the researchers in contact with their interlocutors is also approached, and the scientific neutrality in ethonographies involving trans experiences will also be problematized. In addition, the queer thinking and dilemmas that involve the production of the situated knowledge will be contextualized.

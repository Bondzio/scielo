This article discusses the emergence of citizenship, configured in the uprooting, since they refuse to traditional partnerships, based on legal rights, and in the political membership anchored to state sovereignty. To do this, we analyze the back of the notion of citizenship proposed by T. H. Marshall, showing that under the principle of equality under the law nests the paradox of inclusion-exclusion, resulting in inequality. This contradiction is explored based on the category of contemporary nomadism, built from the perspective of postcolonial theory, which placed in the center, subjects that had been thrown to the margins of the instituted, such as the gathering at the edge of cultures, borders and memories. To achieve this approach, we propose a perspective that speaks to the rationalist tradition centered on the universal man, but also the recognition of difference.

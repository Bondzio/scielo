ABSTRACT The following article seeks to demonstrate how the shift toward accountability to have permeated Brazilian democracy favored the emergence of institutional innovations in the judicial system, promoting a kind of legal Praetorianism. Such Praetorianism, in turn, led to a criminalization of political activities which has shaken the very foundations of Brazilian democracy itself. With a focus on analyzing the Operação Lava Jato [Operation Car Wash] scandal, the authors seek to demonstrate conceptual shifts in the field of representation and public interest. The resultant tension produced between political control and sovereignty is one of the main challenges currently faced by Brazilian democracy, in light of the leading role assumed by the Judiciary Branch, the Public Prosecutor, and the Federal Police in the State&#8217;s employment of strategies to target corruption.

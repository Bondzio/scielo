The article examines modern criticism of governamental reason which is focused by Foucault under two main aspects. First he analyses the concept of critique based on his own interpretation of Kant's work, articulated with an "ontology of the present". Besides this, Foucault analyses the place ocuppied by liberalism in this critical procedure. Thus the article intends to show that Foucault's criticism escapes from the imputation of reformism.

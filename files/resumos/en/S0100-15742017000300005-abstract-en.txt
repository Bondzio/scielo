ABSTRACT Writing centers, originally called laboratories or clinics, were born from the need of American universities to correct writing problems of their students. Thus, their initial motivation gave way to a remedial character: after the second half of the century, there was a modification in this denomination, underlying a change in the way of conceiving language teaching. This indicates that the writing center is now an open space not only for students with difficulties in a discipline, but for everyone. An element that has remained in these spaces from the beginning and that until now has shown to be effective is collaborative learning through peer tutoring. The purpose of this article is to assess the role of this type of learning within the trajectory of writing centers, establishing the scope and limitations that they currently face.

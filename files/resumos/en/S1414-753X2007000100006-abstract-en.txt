This article analyzes the historical evolution of hegemonic representations of the Parana forest and the indigenous population dwelling in it. First, it describes the process in which the official representation of the forest as a threat to progress and a frontier of civilization was created during the 19th and 20th centuries. Second, it analyzes some situations and discourses of the guarani population based on the notion of teko'a. Third, it reflects on some tensions derived from the current apogee of environmental discourse adopted by some pro-indigenous organizations as a political reference.

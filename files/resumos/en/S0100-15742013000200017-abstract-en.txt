In this paper has the following objectives: to characterize the mental representations constructed by congenitally blind children in their social integration in mainstream Primary School and to characterize mental representations created by sighted students in the social integration of blind children in the same context. The theoretical framework sought to relate social development and blindness by exploring the role to be played by adult caregivers and peers in the social development of blind children, particularly in the school environment. Methodologically, a multiple case study design was chosen, using interviews, informal conversations and a sociometric questionnaire. The results suggest that blindness is not the only factor responsible for the sociometric position of these individuals, despite the fact that the pathways for educational social integration are still immature.

Abstract This work aims to undertake a preliminary investigation about the foundation process of candombl&#233; terreiros, starting from ethnographic narratives of a case study where I could see the transformation of an adept in mother of saint. The text unfolds in three main areas, including the material construction of the terreiro, your ritual and spiritual sense as well as their inclusion in the legal / juridical sphere as a religious association. The intention is to show that these dimensions are interconnected, also approaching issues of political, economic order and the debate about property in candombl&#233;.

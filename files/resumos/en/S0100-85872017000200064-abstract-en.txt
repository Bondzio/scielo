Abstract This article presents and analyzes the mobilization motivated by the Transolímpica in its course through Magalhães Bastos, a neighborhood of the western zone of Rio de Janeiro. Interviews, documents and records of meetings involving residents and agents of &#8220;state&#8221; between 2012 and 2015 highlight the strategies and grammars articulated by a local commission interested in preventing the demolition of hundreds of houses in the neighborhood. Through this case, dynamics and techniques of government of the &#8220;Olympic city&#8221; are highlighted, drawing attention to the complexity of these processes and the combination in situ of religious and secular projects, articulated in local contexts and through certain power relations.

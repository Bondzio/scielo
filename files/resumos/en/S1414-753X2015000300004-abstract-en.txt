AbstractMariculture (marine agriculture) comprises an owner, production management and a direct relationship with the environment. Thus, mariculture may be examined by economic, social and environmental sciences. Mariculture is an important alternative form of economic development in coastal communities in which there is an immediate interaction between environment and community. Here we discuss aspects of a sustainable mariculture, examining characteristics of profitable production in connection with conservation of natural systems and the possibility of integrating local practices, conservation and profit.

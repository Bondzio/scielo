The present work analyses Clarice Lispector's story "The Love", starting from the following categories pointed by Sartre in Being and the Anything: to see and to be seen, functionality and love. Starting from the experience elaborated by Clarice in her text, in which Ana - a housewife, always busy serving her family ("pure functionality") - , in one of her goings and comings to and from the city, comes across a blind man chewing a chewing gum. But a blind man has an eye that doesn't see, it is an eye without function. It is this experience that opens to Ana the dimension of love, in a very specific sense (which points out to the gender relationships), and for which the phenomenological Sartre's description seems to us somewhat limited.

In this paper, we use the case of eucalyptus monoculture to explore some analytical contributions of ecological modernization to the discussion on forest transition. We address the issues of including tree monocultures in the computation of the transition, and the indirect influence that these monocultures can play on native forest recovery. We analyze general aspects on the topic, as well as a case study in SÃ£o Luiz do Paraitinga, SP. We argue that monoculture tree plantations should not be accounted in the computation of the transition, but neither should be ignored in discussions about conservation and forest restoration. The case study shows the role played by the pressure of society, not only with their decisions as consumers, but mainly of political articulation for building legal instruments.

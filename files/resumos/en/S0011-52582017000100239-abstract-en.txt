ABSTRACT The following article analyzes the political trajectory of the second generation of Brazilians exiled by the military dictatorship to Chile and France, aiming to understand the dynamic characterizing the transformations of the repertoires of action among migrants frequently observed in studies on exile. It also investigates how forced migration promotes a complete metamorphosis of the structure of political opportunities, leaving the exile inserted in a structure that is distinct from that identified by studies on contentious politics in conflicts inside the Nation-State and from that characterizing the most recent global transnational movements. In fact, exiles in Chile revealed a repertoire adapted to the particularities of exile in Chile, focusing on the continuity of the clash with the Brazilian regime. In France, on the other hand, profound transformations occurred, through an abandoning of the revolutionary project and an adoption of human rights and democracy, among other assertions that were new at the time to the Brazilian left.

The article discusses the idea that a reflective activity regarding teaching professional practices allows individuals to be more efficient when starting work. It is based on data from a study on the analysis of the practices proposed by the Institut Universitaire de Formation des Ma√Ætres - IUFM - (Brittany, France) throughout the initial teachers training program. The discussion shows that, although the analysis of the practices stimulate the creation of a narrative space that, through collective exchanges, allows teachers to build organizing principles of practices that have the potential to generate new teaching practices. This process brings to light professionalization paradigms prevailing in the educational field which diverge as regards the role of theory and its articulation with teaching practices.

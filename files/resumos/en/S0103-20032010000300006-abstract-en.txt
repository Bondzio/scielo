This article provides a review of the major theoretical and empirical issues related to the economic interfaces between agriculture, environment and trade, in general, and particularly to Brazil. Over the years, given the multiplicity of controversial results registered in the literature, it became increasingly clear the role played by the sector and regional specificities in this field of study. The trend of adopting processes and methods potentially and highly degrading to environment, noticed in important segments of Brazilian agriculture, besides generating domestic effects rather negligible, contributes to place the country on the handle of sight of the international environmental groups. Moreover, it hampers the acceptance of national goods in the international market, increasingly reflecting the global environmental issues. Conclusively, it is necessary to define synergistic environmental policies, capable of providing more sustainable patterns of production to the Brazilian agriculture, without compromising their competitiveness.

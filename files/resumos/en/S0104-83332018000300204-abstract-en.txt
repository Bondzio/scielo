Abstract This article in honor of Mariza CorrÃªa presents a personal account regarding the political environment and discussions in Unicamp in the late 1970s. It also examines the contributions made by this great anthropologist in her early studies, both to the development of qualitative research on gender violence in Brazil and to a critical approach to family studies.

Abstract The life of Luiz Gama has been appropriated, interpreted and fictionalized. The convergence, superposition and overlapping versions of Luiz Gama, the historical subject, inserted in the Second Reign, and a fictional Gama have given rise to fiery disagreements among his critics and commentators. In the letter written to his friend Lúcio de Mendonça, a memorial and autobiographical outline, Luiz Gama sums up his origin and background. Based on this letter, Lúcio de Mendonça rewrote Gama&#8217;s biography and published it in two identical versions. One as a biographical draft in the Almanach literário de São Paulo para o ano de 1881 and another, titled "Folhetim," in the Gazeta da Tarde. We resort to the ideas presented by Rancière (2014), primarily regarding the homonymy of &#8216;História/história&#8217; (History/story), to make a critical reading of that publication and the reception of Luiz Gama&#8217;s letter.

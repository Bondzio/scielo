This paper aims to analyze the research with children and to elaborate a critical approach about subjectivity production between adults and children on contemporaneity. Mikhail Bakhtin's Theory of Language was used as the theoretical basis to discuss the complex subject of dialogism and otherness in the relationship between researcher and child during the field work. Our proposal was to enlarge the discussion about this relationship, taking into account the consumer culture and the informational society, as a way of trying to overcome the educational challenges nowadays.

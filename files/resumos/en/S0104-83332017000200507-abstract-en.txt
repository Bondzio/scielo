Abstract The present article aims to narrate the history about three editions of the Miss Boneca Pop (1974-76), beauty pageant for travestis held in the city of Rio de Janeiro in the years 1974, 1975 and 1976. In the year of 2012, these beauty pageants were remembered with the aim to create some legitimacy and tradition to Miss T Brasil, beauty pageant for travestis and transgender women which then was beginning. Making use of newspaper articles; personal photos and narrative of a candidate of two of this editions; and related literature, I intend to do an archeology of the Miss Boneca Pop in relation with Miss T Brasil (2012-15), specially in the tradition that this one has created based in the first one.

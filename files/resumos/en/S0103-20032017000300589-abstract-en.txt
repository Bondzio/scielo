Abstract: The objective of this work was to analyze the forms of governance on the Local Productive Arrangement (APL) of Brazil nut (Berthollethia excelsa Bonpl.) in the Calha Norte region, state of Par√°, characterizing the specific factors that influence the governance, emphasizing the main underlying theoretical approaches. The data were obtained by means of a structured questionnaire in standard RedeSist, applied to agents of the local productive chain, with emphasis to the Brazil nuts processing companies. The analysis of the results has been developed on the basis respondent&#8217;s perception indices on their structure, governance and the advantages associated with the local environment and based on theories of productive agglomerations, competitiveness and governance. The great competition among companies for processing business transactions locally promotes internalization of knowledge and learning individually, not unfolding a generation of information to APL as a whole, in which the processes of cooperation and learning have basically passed the accumulated experience in the production and consequential incremental innovations in products and processes, thus characterizing an internal capacity of the innovative companies. It was concluded that there are low capacity of management and governance at the systemic form cooperatives and actions, and even in the absence of more specialized governance structures, there is a predominance of market governance in the APL studied.

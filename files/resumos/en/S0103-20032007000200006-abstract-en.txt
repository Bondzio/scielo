This paper presents the families' credit conditions in rural areas in Brazil. We perform the analysis in two steps. First, we follow an indirect approach, where the credit rationing is associated to the wealth importance in the families' decisions, using micro data from Demographic Census of 1991 and 2000. The second stage is based on information about formal credit. The results point out to: (i) strong evidences of credit rationing; (ii) an unequal regional distribution of this credit rationing; e (iii) no direct relationship between the families' credit conditions and the total availability of formal credit.

This article intends to show, through Alfredo Poviña' narrative, the possible atmosphere of the first congresses of the Latin American Sociology Association (ALAS). It is not restricted to a mere reproduction of the authors words; rather, based on them - which are seen as partial and interested - it attempts to show in a very preliminary way a few questions that allow to move on with the interrogation about the genesis of ALAS. To achieve the proposed aim, some texts are summarized, which allow to get to know ALAS' foundation. Data are briefly presented about the six first ALAS congresses. Poviña's idea of sociology is reviewed, closing with a brief systematization of the core points that emerge from his work, which would allow a more adequate interrogation about the origins of ALAS. This essay is very simple and has a provisional and preliminary character. It only seeks to shed some light to explore the past in order for its occlusion not to deform the future, based on the conviction that sociology must be a scientific discipline that makes epistemic vigilance and reflexivity its central activities.

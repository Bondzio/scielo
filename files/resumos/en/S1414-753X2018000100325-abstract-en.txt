Abstract The Model of Excellence in Public Management (MEGP) stands out for the results from the management of protected areas. This study aimed to analyze the applicability of this model to improve the effectiveness in management of the Pernambuco conservation units. As a reference, the Ecological Station chosen was Caet√©s, the first State unit deployed with a management plan and participatory management. Adapting the model to the unit management conditions and, through workshops with managers, the MEGP criteria were analyzed, the existing management practices identified and the results presented. The analysis revealed managerial gaps that interfere with the unit management and the use of the model helps to improve it, also improving outcomes for biodiversity conservation policies.

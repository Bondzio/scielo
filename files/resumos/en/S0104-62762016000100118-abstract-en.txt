Abstract This paper tests the hypothesis that decreasing the age of criminal majority will reduce violence. Methodologically, the research design uses spatial analysis, descriptive and multivariate statistics to examine an original dataset created based on secondary sources. We focus on juvenile judicial system in comparative perspective centering in two variables: (1) age of criminal majority and (2) age of criminal responsibility. The general average of criminal majority tends to 18 years, while the average age of criminal responsibility tends to 11 years. The result shows a negative correlation between the age of criminal majority and homicides rates. That means that countries with lower age of criminal majority have higher rates of violence. With this paper we hope to contribute in the discussion regarding criminal majority reduction in Brazil and in the development of specific public policies to reduce violence.

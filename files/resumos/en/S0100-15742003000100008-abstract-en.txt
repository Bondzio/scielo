To reflect upon social practices, in a context marked by a permanent degradation of the environment and its ecosystem, involves a necessary articulation with the production of meanings on environmental education. The environmental dimension is now increasingly configured as an issue that comprises a team of players from the educational universe, strengthening the involvement of different knowledge systems, professional capacity building and the university community in an interdisciplinary perspective. The challenge posed is to formulate environmental education that is both critical and innovative on both the formal and informal levels. Thus, it must be primarily a political act concerned with social transformation. Its focus should be on searching for a holistic action perspective that correlates mankind, nature and the universe, having as a reference point the fact that natural resources run out and that mankind bears the main responsibility for its degradation.

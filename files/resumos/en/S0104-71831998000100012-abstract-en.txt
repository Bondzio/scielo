Abstract It is a commonplace in discussions of immigrant religion to speak of how religion aids in the adjustment of migrants to a new culture and society; how it serves as a dimension of continuity in the process of integration. This article examines theoretical foundations for reconsidering this perspective in the context of globalization in general and global migration in particular. In a global society, it is far less useful to think of migrants as leaving one society to join another, especially insofar as this optic tends to assume a) that the new &#8220;host&#8221; culture remains comparatively unaffected while the immigrants culture faces the dilemma of assimilation versus ethnic preservation; and b) that the culture of origin simply loses a few members without much effect by the migrants back onto their cultures of origin. By contrast, the article argues that the consequences of migration are to help (re)define religions in all areas where they are represented; and thus to make distinctions between &#8220;core&#8221; and &#8220;diaspora&#8221; far less salient. Instead, different areas where religious traditions are represented are better seen as centres for creating different options for the authentic construction of the same religion; options that are very often in communication with each other.

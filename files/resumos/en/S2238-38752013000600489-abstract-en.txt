Abstract I propose to discuss Siegfried Kracauer's and Walter Benjamin's penchant to deal with marginal objects of investigation or details and to articulate this kind of epistemological procedure as a result of an adaptation to the historical present as well as a positioning concerning sociological discussions contemporary to the authors. The letters between both of them and the reviews that each one wrote on the works of the other are the main material for the discussion. Although not systematically, I mention also some works of the authors to indicate how their social analyze privilege everyday objects and/or fragments of the social life and some implications of this procedure.

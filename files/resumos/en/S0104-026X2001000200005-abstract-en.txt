This article deals with the universe of representations of new reproductive technologies and analyzes the consequences of those procedures for Western notions of personhood and kinship. These techniques affect Western ways of thinking about reproduction and human control over nature. Reports of embryos created outside the maternal body by in vitro fertilization are examined to consider notions of personhood. The understanding of new reproductive technologies informs and is informed by representations of kinship. The analysis of the relation between technologies of procreation, kinship and personhood takes into account Western beliefs on nature as a foundation for reality. The research draws on articles published in the Brazilian press between 1994 and 2000.

ABSTRACT In this paper, I attempt to present and discuss the paths taken in the process of producing the 1st and 2nd versions of the National Curricular Common Core that took place from 2015 to 2016. The National Common Core is foreseen since the Law of National Education (LDB) established in 1986. I present an overview of the process and specifically discuss the area of Natural Sciences and the proposals for each of the Science curricular components, in primary and secondary education. I seek to establish a dialogue, from my point of view, between these proposals and scientific literacy assumptions.

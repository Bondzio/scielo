This study aims to contribute to the formulation of a National Public Policy of control of exotic species, through the characterization of the Brazilian legal-institutional framework. After an extensive reading of the document, we concluded that there are obstacles to the construction of this public policy, and we also recognize the need of an urgent definition and structuring of a coordination of the agents of different sectors, assuring the consistency of the actions and the practical efficiency of this policy.

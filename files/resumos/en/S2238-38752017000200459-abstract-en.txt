Abstract This article aims to contribute to the understanding of the process of integration of immigrants in host-societies. We studied Brazilian immigrants in Oporto in order to understand, through the analysis of the phenomenon's social, political and cultural dimensions, how migrations are associated with the inscriptions of these immigrants in the social space. By taking into account migration systems theory and by resorting to a survey, the research's results validate the existence of a strong relation between the different dimensions analysed and also stress the influence of the social dimension in the integration processes. The cultural dimension was useful in understanding the snowball effect that some social and political variables assume in the comprehension of how cultural space is organised.

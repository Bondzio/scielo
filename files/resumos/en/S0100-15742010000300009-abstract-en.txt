This essay defends the researcher's need to be attentive to the differences between inquiry and conviction. Science and ideology are situated in different domains - those of inquiry (production of knowledge) and those of conviction (political action).

After indicating some questions that result from the transit between ideology and science in educational research, the essay ends by indicating problems that derive from present academic policies

Abstract The article uses ethnographic works to analyze the continuity between different forms of writing - materialized in stone, woven in cloth or basketry or inscribed in bilingual paperbacks - and the language of Indigenous songs and speeches. All form of writing is evidence of the formal capacity of human thought and practice. The concrete forms of writing analysed here would hence express a mathematical capacity which, like the capacity for language, manifests itself among all peoples and cultures in different ways, but always preserves something as invariable: relations rather than content.

This paper reviews Brazilian literature regarding public policy councils on different types of academic productions (articles, master's thesis and doctoral dissertations) published from 2000 to 2011 in order to contribute on shaping new research agendas to the subject. We draw a diagnosis of general profile and trends of this production and compare the debate in and across disciplinary fields that have produced more about the subject: Social Sciences, Health, Social Services and Education. We concluded that there were growth, consolidation and changes on the research agenda in the area of discussion within the period analyzed, suggesting the debate is ripening. These general trends gain, however, different degrees, forms and directions relying of the disciplinary fields.

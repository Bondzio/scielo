The international system for the classification of protected natural areas developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is intended to provide a common language for the management of these areas. The main objective of this study is to examine the institutional compatibility between different countries and the guidelines proposed by the IUCN. The method used consisted of a comparative analysis of the institutional and legal frameworks in South Africa, Australia, Brazil, China, the United States and Italy. The findings indicate that few countries have adopted the IUCN proposals in their entirety. Some have adapted their laws to the international guidelines, although with various changes, such as differences in the nomenclature used for management categories, while in other countries the legislation diverges substantially from these guidelines. In conclusion, these divergences and incompatibilities make it difficult to exchange experiences at an international level and adopt common strategies for the conservation of natural heritage.

In this article, we present a genealogical analysis about the shaping of movements which propose to think about cyberculture as a political tool to find spaces for non-misogynists and non-heteronormative ways of living; we call this context gender / sexuality technopolitics. Focusing mainly on digital gaming, and seeking to understand the conditions that made possible the emergence of a LGBT pride parade in one of those, we discuss the Cyberpunk, Cyberfeminist, Girl Games and Cyberqueer movements, reflecting about the contingent power of cybercultural environments, and its differential statute in the gender / sexuality construction and experience.

Abstract This article discusses the challenges of feminization in a specific sector: housing construction. Recent research has brought evidence of the imbrication between work and bullying and gender harassment practices in the construction of the professional identity of construction engineers. Undergoing peculiar organization and working conditions, since early, engineers face the rude and disrespectful treatment received from colleagues and bosses as an integral part of their practical training. In general, these standards of conduct are accepted as normal, not as bullying. For women engineers, there is also gender harassment, which is characterized by explicit situations of discrimination and violence, which tend to negatively influence their greater inclusion in construction sites.

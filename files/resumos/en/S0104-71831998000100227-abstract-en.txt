Abstract This essay points out to what and how has changed, or should change, within ethnic studies in Brazil in the light of a number of new grand theories in the field of ethnic studies in the context of globalization. The process of globalization creates new conditions for the iternationalization of black cultures. It also broadens the reservoir of symbols from which blackness, and the new forms that it is taking, can draw inspiration. Analizing these dynamics exclusively through the perspective of race relations in the Anglo-Saxon world can end up empoverishing our gaze.

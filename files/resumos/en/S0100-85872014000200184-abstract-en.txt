The paper investigates the emergence of a Pentecostal market of preaching and                testimonies, in which individuals engage themselves in the careers of                "itinerant-preachers", "giving their testimony" in churches and events. Through the                narratives of dramatic episodes of their past, these individuals struggle to be                included at the margins of religious market, converting their shattered biographies                into symbolic commodities. In this Pentecostal industry of suffering, subjects                considered "subproducts" of modernization are assimilated due to their character of                "rest", due to the ambivalence their strange identities provide. Therefore, it is                analyzed the construction of a sufferings market, perhaps one of the most surprising                inventions of the &#8216;Brazilian way&#8217; form of religious capitalism, in which the                "abnormal" is transmuted in a lever for accumulation.

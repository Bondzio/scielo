Abstract: In this paper, from an interdisciplinary point of view, which is based on the theoretical framework of French Discourse Analysis and based on Social Psychology, we analyze the ethos of a self-help book about relationships addressed to women. The analysis reveals that, anchored in the traditional stereotype of women, the self-help discourse adopts a melodramatic tone and especially a didactic tone, proposing to women that they need to be more rational and less emotionalÂ¸ collaborating, in a non-obvious way, to maintain the system of inequalities between the genres.

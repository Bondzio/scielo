Aiming at the development of the study of non-anglophone authors in the Political Science literature in Brazil, this text seeks to approach the issues of both Democracy and Regionalism in Jean-Louis Quermonne's bibliography. It has three parts. The first situates the author in the French political science scenario through a brief biography. The second part promotes a critical and comparative analysis of Quemonne's works on Democracy , i.e.: Le Gouvernement de la France sous la Vème République, Les régimes politiques occidentaux and Les politiques institutionnelles. The third part inquires, also critically and comparatively, about Quermonne's thinking on Regionalism: Le système politique de l'Union Européenne, L'Europe et le fédéralisme and L'Europe en quête de légitimité. Finally, this article brings some conclusive considerations, pointing out both the importance of the French, in general, and Quermonne's, in particular, political thought.

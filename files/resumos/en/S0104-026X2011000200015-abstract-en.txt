People and machines are increasingly connected, by an intensely symbiotic process. Youth are especially affected by this procedure, developing a cyborg subjectivity. This article analyses the cyborging process in the interface between the school curriculum and the Orkut curriculum. The research that subsidizes this article investigated the interface between the public high school curriculum, and the communities and profiles of students from this school in Orkut. The theoretical basis is constituted by gender and curriculum studies, and the perspective is post-critical. The argument developed is that the strategies used in one curriculum can be translated into the other by the interface between them, resulting both in the transgression and the strengthening of gender borders.

This article describes advances in feminist epistemology that began with the perception of science as binary and androcentric, which revealed the mutually-constituting relationship between the subjects of science and the knowledge they produce. This understanding, establishing the possibility of combating deterministic and binary science through the analysis of the production of knowledge as a social and historical process, also revealed the ideological nature of the social world. The authors discussed construct a critical, dialectical and relational perspective which aims to illuminate how 'differences' are articulated in systemic relations of domination, and to transform this 'problematic' world.

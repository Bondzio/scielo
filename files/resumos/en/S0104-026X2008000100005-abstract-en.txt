This work investigates the social representations of the body in the Trip For Woman magazine, considering the body and gender theories systematically elaborated by the existing feminisms. It is assumed that the beliefs, the representation and the meanings of what it is to be a man or a woman in a certain society and moment are crystallized in the bodies. Thus, it is possible to infer the gender representations that are mediated and inscribed in the body.

The national debate around the educators' professional training system, the legal provisions and the curricular guidelines remains open. The recent homologation of the Resolution of the National Council of Education CNE about the national curricular guidelines for the Pedagogy courses brought about more problems than solutions.

This article discusses these theoretical and practical elements which must function as assumptions for the issuance of laws, rules and guidelines that are meant to regulate educational issues, specifically, curricular organization issues of educators' training courses. Besides that, it puts the recent CNE resolution under criticism in view of the elements pointed out.

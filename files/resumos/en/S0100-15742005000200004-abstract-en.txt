On its first part, this article proposes a reflection based on the difficulties found within University Institutes for Teacher Qualification - IUFMs - ,in France, to efficiently articulate the results of education and qualification research with the practices of teacher qualification. Our assumption is that these difficulties refer to an opposition between what we call an "epistemology of knowledge" and "an epistemology of action", which is concretized in the conception, organization, and administration of IUFMs. These two epistemologies are then compared in order to illustrate some of the recurrent aporias of the professional exercise and in the qualification and its relationship with research and its results. On its second part, aimed at presenting an approach called ergonomics/qualification, this article demonstrates that the symmetric difficulties observed by these two epistemologies could be partially repositioned by means of an analysis of the work, and especially of the development of work on the issues of qualification and research. Following, this ergonomics/qualification program is presented from a complex that articulates options in the ethical, ontological, and epistemological spheres, and which is believed to contribute to reconcile the academic and professional components of education and satisfy the demands concerning both practice and scientific rigor.

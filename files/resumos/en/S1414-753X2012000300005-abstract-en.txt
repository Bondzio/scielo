This research paper has investigated the socio-enviromental conflicts in the extractivism of aroeira (Schinus terebebinthifolius Raddi) in the lower SÃ£o Francisco river, the states of Sergipe and Alagoas. In order to carry out this research, which spanned ten years starting in 2001 and ending in 2011, we resorted to interviews with the actors involved in the extractivism of aroeira as well as documental research. Data were analysed on the basis of conduct towards extractivism and classification of conflict. The lack of standard procedures in the management of the species is a key factor in bringing about conflicts arising in the appropriation of and access to aroeira. The fishermen who are also engaged in extractivism collect it for its economic value, whereas the processing/exporting companies focus on its role as merchandise. The different spheres of government tend to disagree on which one is entitled to regulate licencing and supervising of extractivism. The need has been found to design a sustainable forest management for the species in which both dialogue and cooperation among all actors involved have a place.

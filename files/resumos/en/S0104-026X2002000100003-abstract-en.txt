The global circulation of Neo-Zapatistas and non-Indigenous solidarity activists as symbols of resistance in cyberspace between 1994 and 2001 suggests the need for new ways to read social movements in the digital age. A feminist reading of the dual local/global characteristics of the discursive space surrounding the Maya rebellion in Chiapas both affirms and contests prevalent postmodern theories about the relationship between the human body and cybernetic technologies. This hybrid space both transgresses and affirms borders between actor and audience, writer and reader, human and machine. The relationship between the theater of material resistance in the physical Conflict Zone and the growth of virtual resistance in Cyber-Chiapas illustrates the 'cyborg' material/technological nature of the Chiapas rebellion.

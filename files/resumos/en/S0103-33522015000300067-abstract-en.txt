Bank workspaces are understood as micro fields, with structures and dispositions conditioning practices - social transactions - of employees and customers. Daily, these agents transactionally reconstitute appropriate choices and attitudes at every situation experienced by participating in political struggles that continually remake correlations of forces, hierarchies, leadership and power systems in micro fields. Concrete situations are analyzed at Bank of Brazil, based on data generated by document analysis, semi-structured interviews, and direct observation. By discussing forms of exercising power and strategies of struggle and resistance in micro fields, results reveal features, changes and socio-political complexities, under Bank of Brazil's Stability and Employability regimes.

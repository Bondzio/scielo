Abstract: Casual agricultural workers in Andalusia and Extremadura have a special treatment in unemployment benefits compared to other Spanish territories. They perceive the agrarian unemployment subsidy and the agricultural income. The main aim is to know the demographic changes experienced by this collective along 30 years since of its creation and its distribution to regional and local levels. Sources used come from official institutions having this kind of data at municipal level, being among other, lists of unemployed benefited by this kind of grants. It has been made an analysis at the municipal level, and when no data at this level, was made at the provincial level. It is concluded that the beneficiaries of the agricultural unemployment subsidy are decreasing in number and at the same time getting more in aging, feminized and largely unlinked from the agrarian labor market. On the other hand, the collective benefited by agricultural income is younger and similarly feminized, although appears, since 2009, the young and very young male as a result of the economic crisis. Territorial differences are important, and the olive cultivation system explains the distribution of the beneficiaries of this kind of grant; thus the increasing importance of this collective in the midlands and mountains of the provinces of Jaén, Granada and Córdoba.

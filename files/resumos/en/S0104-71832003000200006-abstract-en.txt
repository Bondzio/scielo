The tourist system forces us to consider as much the local society as the visitors, that is the reason for which all the studies must go directed to look for the well-being of both, trying to diminish the negative impacts, either they are social, cultural, physical or economic. As far as the anthropological patrimony, it can affirm that the only way to include/understand its reality is approaching him to observe it like product of the society in permanent state of change, at the same time that deciphers the interrelation of all its components. It is necessary to interpret to the human being in the means in which it has been developed and it continues doing it. Only of this form we will be in capacity to plan a series of tie actions to the use of the patrimony with tourist aims, without harming the normal development of the community that has originated it.

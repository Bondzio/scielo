Abstract The social sciences on social inequality in Brazil emphasize the role that the residential of social groups in urban space plays in the production and/or reproduction of asymmetries of social positioning, with the acceleration of economic globalization as of the 1990s. But what happens in urban spaces that, like the Praça da Sé, in the city of São Paulo, are highly open to social diversity during workdays? The ethnographic data based on the observation of 39 Monday and Friday afternoons in 2013 is submitted to a Lefebvrean and Goffmanian dialectical and phenomenological perspective. I aim to answer how and why the bodily use pedestrians made of this place may interfere in the (re)production of social inequality in São Paulo in this second decade of the 21st century. Hence secular body-behavioural and moral inequalities will come to the fore.

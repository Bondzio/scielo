Abstract After the Unesco research about racial relations in Brazil, Florestan Fernandes headed a new team of young Brazilian sociologists, composed by Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Roberto Jardim Moreira and Oct치vio Ianni, to deal with the same theme in Southern Brazil. The region was omitted from the first Unesco research. The states of Paran치 and Santa Catarina were put in charge of Oct치vio Ianni, the last one shared with Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Even the main goal of the research was to prove prejudice among Black and White in Southern Brazil Ianni was astonished to find out that there was also prejudice against immigrant poles and their descendants in the city of Curitiba, capital of the state of Paran치. Ianni began to investigate the theme and published later few articles about that where He tried to explain the unexpected prejudice. To investigate further the phenomenon, He prepared a project plan and published it. Unhappily, this new research was never accomplished.

Brazil and the United States are considered the main participants in the world market of orange juice. United States subsidies affect Brazilian exports of concentrate and frozen orange juice (SLCC, in Portuguese) and the Brazilian participationin theglobal market for the product. Therefore, the objective isto analyze the influence of the American agricultural subsidies on the Brazilian exports of orange juice, in the period between 1991 and 2006. The theoretical model to study the international trade was proposed by Brander and Spencer (1985), Brander (1995) and Brander and Spencer(2007), focusing on imperfect competition incorporating the government intervention. In the empiric approach, a junction of models of temporary series and of theory of the games was elaborated, as instruments to evaluate the effect of the subsidies on the orange juice exports. The conclusion is that the American protection harmed the exporter capacity of Brazil in the analyzed period. One important concluding aspect is the Brazilian participation on the defense of the liberalization of the agricultural trade, for its access to the protected section and for the conquest of new trading partners.

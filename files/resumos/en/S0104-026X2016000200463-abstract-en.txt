Abstract: Inventions, technologies, experiments, books and tools are elements that are part of the plots of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs I and II. This article aims to analyze gender relations in such animated films that present the background and scientific inventions and technological truths permeated by gendered demands. Thus, I argue that, in the films analyzed, different subject positions for men and women are produced through the scientific-technological discourse. In the cultural artifacts analyzed, some subjects are part of the scientific doings, of the rational, of the technological inventiveness; others have secondary, supporting and assisting role. This contributes to the production of gendered subjects in science. Therefore, in the midst of hamburgers, cheese and sauces, many discourses and demands pour for the ones who watch them.

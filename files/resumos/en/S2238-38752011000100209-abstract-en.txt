Abstract: The article is a brief overview on the field of anthropology in Brazil. Originally made for foreign readers, it seemed best to leave it as it was to update it, in the hope that it will be useful for young beginners in this field, since the text mentions some important institutions for their instruction in recent years - as programs of post-graduation and Brazilian Anthropological Association (ABA), and their research topics. It is proposed here also that not only interdisciplinarity, widely practiced today, but also link-ups to their own field of anthropology are desirable - that is, that "urban" anthropologists take into account what ethnologists say, that the latter discuss with gender studies, etc. Anyway, the bibliography included still is, and will remain so for a long time, required reading for researchers who are interested in the history of anthropology.

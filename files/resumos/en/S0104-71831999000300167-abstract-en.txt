The article examines the narrative in an interview with Anita Xavier da Costa, the daughter of Francisco Xavier da Costa (1871-1934), a pioneer in the dissemination of socialist ideas in Rio Grande do Sul. Three aspects are underscored: the way the deponent seeks to build a consistent retrospect of her father&#8217;s life, the gender conditioning of her memories and the process which has made her to take the role of &#8220;guardian of Francisco&#8217;s memory&#8221;.

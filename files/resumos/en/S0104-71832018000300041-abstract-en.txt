Abstract In recent decades, and especially marked in recent years, the issue of secularism has re-emerged with impetus in Uruguay. The controversies and the main actors are not new (Catholic Church, Masonry), but the episodes that force to problematize the concept of secularity happen one after another, serving as pieces of a tense board of moralities, values and practices in dispute. The arrival of Tabaré Vázquez to the national government in 2005, his succession by José Mujica in 2010, and his return to the presidency in 2015 are the thread of the various episodes described in this text, including disputes over the installation of religious symbols in the public space and the account of the last alliances between religion and politics in Uruguay.

Inquire on how we categorize and differentiate refugee immigrants within the framework of international protection policies that focused on the Palestinians who had to organize his escape from Palestinian cities since 1948.Explicit the ways in which immigration control technologies have been designed by social scientists from examining its uses and transformations before border situations and watch the transformation of the legal status of people on the move. The focus of this reflection lies in showing how many devices interact: laws, administrative documents and procedures through the bureaucracy agents who embody the state. To this end, it examines how immigration governmentality technologies interfere in Palestinian choices at the time experienced the exodus. These aspects are intertwined with the emergence of an international protection system and the emergence of humanitarian agencies with regional mandates, such as the United Nations Relif and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), before the High Commissioner United Nations (UNHCR) appearance after the 1951 Convention on the recognition and protection of refugees.

AbstractIn the past and present Cape Verdean context, there is a Strong connection between family and mobility. This fact suggests that the local practices and conceptions about kinship do not exhaust themselves neither in the blood ties, nor in the sharing of substances in situations of co-presence. Based on my ethnographic experience with Cape Verdean women who live in the Italian city of Naples, this paper aims to analyze the way how mobility and kinship interact in practice, as well as the impact that the Cape Verdean case can have on the anthropological studies about kinship.

Abstract The article analyzes the meanings and social uses of money in popular and middle classes of the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, from the perspective of economic social studies. It is the result of the dialogue between two empirical researches conducted between 2009 and 2014. First, we identify ways of labeling money to show how common sense typifications used by different actors organize their budgets. Second, we analyze the moral evaluations that participants in both studies performed on the origins of money, showing how different appreciations and moral judgments affect their uses. In a final section, we conclude on the existence of different schemes of perception and appreciation as well as plural uses of money in popular and middle classes of Buenos Aires. We also reflect on the potentiality of interdisciplinary integration of methodologies and data in social research.

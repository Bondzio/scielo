Abstract In this article we set out to explore the mutual constitution of post-soviet identity and geopolitical referents serving as the discursive ground for Putin&#8217;s foreign policy. We further explore the role of the geo-identitarian discourse in justifying the recomposition of the post-Soviet space after 2000 and the promotion of a new international order. Methodologically, we resort to a dialectics of sorts between &#8220;high&#8221; and &#8220;low&#8221; geopolitics in order to uncover the interdependence of national narratives produced by political power (top-down) and society (bottom-up). We come to the conclusion that the plasticity and hybridity of the Russian symbolic grammar has allowed Putin to define a pragmatic and assertive foreign policy intent both on regaining international status for Russia and consolidating the domestic coalition of interests led by him.

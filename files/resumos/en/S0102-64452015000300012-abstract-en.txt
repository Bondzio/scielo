Abstract The Brazilian transition to democracy occurred without notable ruptures. Under the strong legacy of the civil-military dictatorship, the historical recollection of the period includes two fundamental events: the publication of the project Brasil Nunca Mais and the opening of the graveyard of Perus. From these foundational events the main goal of this study is to offer a reflexive panorama of the first memorial sites of the period, preserved or built in the city of SÃ£o Paulo. In spite of the limits imposed by the negotiated political transition, these memorial sites benefited the birth of the collective consciousness about the dictatorship repression and the social status of the victims and the survivors. This research is based on interviews with people directly involved in these events, rare documents and a review of the existing bibliography on the matter.

Therefore, we analyze the legal prohibition for direct and indirect discrimination to women that executes the same function occupied by a man, systematization that reveals socio-occupational diversities and a still insufficient legal compensation by the positive discrimination. We observe that despites the progress achieved with the inclusion of women in the labor market, the socioeconomic, political and cultural determinations that affects gender relations interferes in the applicability of the legal instruments, connecting this legal issue with other diversities in the contemporary capitalism; consequently equal pay remains as an urgent and challenging demand of citizenship.

This article explores the relationship between collective action and the construction of female citizenship through the appropriation of the public space. For this, recent theoretical contributions were collected and interviews were conducted with a group of women who managed the regularization of land tenure in the community. Although the participants achieved new social spaces, they considered their experience as an extension of their traditional domestic roles. These results are part of an ongoing investigation, which seeks to deepen civic practices configured in the regularization of the land.

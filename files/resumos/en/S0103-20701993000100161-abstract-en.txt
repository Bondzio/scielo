New forms of collective action spring up in the realm of urban life and feature as main actors the young dwellers of the outskirts of cities like S&#227;o Paulo (Brazil). Brought about from the sociability in the world of the streets, these forms of action structure the young actors around various trends which may result in the formation of gangs, mobs and racist groups - the skinheads - or groups which gather round activities of self expression like music. As from the mid 80s one has seen the springing up and spreading of RAP music groups (Rhythm and Poetry). By means of dance and music, which is carried out in the streets, RAP gathers mostly the poor young black people and points out cultural exclusion, police violence and discrimination at work and school.

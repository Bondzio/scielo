Abstract The &#8220;sociology of critical capacity&#8221; of Luc Boltanski is becoming a major paradigm in social theory. Against the understanding of reflexivity in Pierre Bourdieu critical sociology, Boltanski believes that social actors must be treated as reflexive beings, fully capable to judge and criticize the world. However, this so called &#8220;critical capacity&#8221; works in his sociology most as a theoretical premise, then as concrete object of inquiry. This text argues that a sociology interested in subjects&#8217; critical capacity cannot simply presuppose it. Most important is to constitute critical capacity as an object of sociological investigation. Redefining the human critical capacity as a reflexive competence, in Margaret Archer terms, is a useful way to do so. Archer&#8217;s concepts help us to identify the limits of the Boltanski&#8217;s sociology, but also, to amplify its scope.

Abstract The present article aims to analyse a phenomenon, which is increasing visible in contemporary Brazilian politics: LGBT political candidacies. The article is organised in three sections. In the first section, I explore the academic debate on the institutional political field, with a special emphasis on political parties and electoral recruitment in Post-redemocratisation Brazil. In the second section, I analyse the relationships (and the tensions) between homosexual activists and leftist political parties (specially the Worker&#8217;s Party) since the emergence of the homosexual political movement in late 1970&#8217;s until Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva&#8217;s administration (2003-2011). In the third section, I investigate pro-LGBT rights candidates profiles. In order to do so, I used information about openly-LGBT and allied candidates who committed to LGBT rights, according to ABGLT in the last elections (2002, 2004, 2008 e 2012). Data was collected at the TSE website and it was organised in a SPSS database.

Abstract This article analyzes the media controversies about the infringements of the &#8220;Mensal√£o&#8221; scandal. The assumption that guides the analysis is that, with its own brand of rhetoric in its operative way of narrating the political world, the press used the framework of moral panic as an interpretative package to approach the case. The work draws on 150 texts published by the main Brazilian daily newspapers and weekly magazines in the period from the 12th-19th of September, 2013, the week of the final judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice on the embargoes. The results show that the press acted as a moral actor in defense of the fight against political corruption, questioning the right to appeal the penalties of the "mensaleiros". In order to do so, it used arguments from authorities and experts, aligned with the risk framework for society and weakening democracy, linking embargoes to impunity and contempt for the public interest.

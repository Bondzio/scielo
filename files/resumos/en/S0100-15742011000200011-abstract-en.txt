This is both a research project and an empirical study that analyzes the question of literacy amongst youngsters. The experience occurred within the context of a strong concern for developing a feminist methodology; for this reason, the two aspects are linked together. The experience has evoluted to a practice and the study prompts reflection on the development of the feminist methodology for teaching young people. The project's participants were students from the public education system in Goi√¢nia (GO) and the central themes were gender relations and sexuality. The project was developed in a feminist NGO. Activities included regular workshops and the publication and distribution of a pamphlet. The results showed that boys were less interested in the proposal, but that both girls and boys actively participated in the study: most of those who started the workshops remained until the end.

Despite solid evidence, the contributions of Behavioral Analysis for planning of teaching conditions have been underutilized. This article aims to share some of these contributions to the field of education. Based on work concerning the applications of Behavioral Analysis to education, the article offers some guidance on relevant aspects that teachers should be aware of in teaching-learning processes. The contributions are separated into three categories: radical behaviorist contributions; description and application of behavioral principles to the educational context; systematized teaching proposals with a behavioral basis. New studies could deepen the behavioral contributions to education and highlight them by areas.

This study deals with the way people from an urban locality with many social and environmental problems manifest their commitments towards the environment. The results showed three types of commitment named here as "active passivity"; "withstand passivity" and "controlled passivity", that express the ethos present in this population, which emerged from their individual and collective experiences.

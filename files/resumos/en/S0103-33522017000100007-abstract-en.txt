Abstract Journalism and politics have their ties often examined from a prestige press perspective. Little or nothing is discussed about the political dimension of popular journalism in Brazil. To make this debate more consistent, this paper aims to develop: a) a theoretical investment on the adequacy of the category &#8220;tabloid&#8221; and in the process of &#8220;tabloidization&#8221; before the Brazilian media scene; b) an analysis of economic and competitive issues inherent to popular journalism in Brazil; c) a proposal of a research agenda for the development of a methodological and epistemological model to identify and distinguish tabloid and quality papers; and finally d) a brief discussion on space occupied by the political section before others in Brazilian popular news coverage.

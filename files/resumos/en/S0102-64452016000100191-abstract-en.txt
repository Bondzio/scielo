Various efforts aimed at recovering the memory of dictatorial period have been undertaken in Brazil nowadays. Drawing from the debates related to the memory of the Holocaust, this article calls attention to the need to discuss the potential risks and benefits that the understanding of the memory of the dictatorial period as a means of promoting the promotion of national reconciliation presents. Aware of the potential for liberation/restoration of remembrance, this article discusses, besides the difficulty of communicating traumatic memory, the risks related to its use. When discussing these issues, we hope to contribute to the meanings attributed to the memories of thousands of victims allowing the construction of projects that change the present and the future, and avoid further human rights violations.

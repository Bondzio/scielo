This work attempts to articulate a feminist and holist account of our desires and their relation to nature. I consider desires in relation to our bodies, the environment around them and how they respond to the forces within our subjectivities, to society around us and to the evolutionary history of our species. I start out considering the separation of the personal and the political and then move on to make some remarks about nature and the three intertwined ecologies described by Guattari. I suggest that we understand the body as a meeting point for those ecologies and, at the same time, as constituting itself a political platform. I then offer a model of how nature constrains and shape our desire so that no specific message is drawn by our desires from nature. It follows that our desires can be changed as they are not in any sense more natural than the rest of our subjectivity. This change, I claim, is to be thought of in terms of an ecological politics.

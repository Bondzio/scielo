Abstract In this short chronicle, a somewhat allegorical narrative intertwining sporadic writings with basic readings, the author follows the vicissitudes of the Alto Tietê metropolitan area and its water resources management up to the water crisis of 2014-2015. The narrative begins with the founding of the city and its first settlers. Later, in the 20th century, it attempts to capture certain features and decisive moments of urbanization and industrial growth, with special focus on hydroelectricity and the symbol of the Henry Borden power plant; a panoramic view of the city, outlined by Aziz Ab'Saber in the 1950s; and the rapid growth of the metropolis until the 1990s and its environmental degradation. In this last decade, he records participatory initiatives in management of the water. In the first decades of the new century, contrary to expectations, it was as if a curse had befallen São Paulo, and the drought of 2014-2015 made it clear that if a government exists, there is no water governance. Reinstating proposals from the 1990s, the author challenges to government and technical experts to restore the hydraulic conditions of the Tietê river, adapting it to the current strategic requirements: water supply and environmental sanitation.

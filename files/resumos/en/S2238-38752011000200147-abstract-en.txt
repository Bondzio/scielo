Abstract: This article discusses the new paradigm of social policies named post-Washington Consensus, citizen-consumer or social investment and the forms it assumes in the Brazilian context. The empirical reference is the Women for Peace Program in Rio de Janeiro which aims at empowering women in poor communities to "rescue" young people at risk of joining organized crime and to act as local leaders. The article analyzes the tense coexistence of different discourses that mobilize maternalist assumptions associated with femininity placing them at the service of development goals and the new concepts of "active citizenship", which are based on the idea of investing in the subjects as individuals and promoting autonomy and self-development, the so-called empowerment.

In this work we propose to discuss the relationship among imaginationy, work and sexuality, from the activities of crab pickers that live in the bragantina region, called Salgado Paraense. The aim is to link such themes to the enchanted figure that inhabits the mangroves where the people pick the crustaceans called Ata√≠de, as well as to discuss the sexual acts between people of the same sex, in this case, involving the masculine universe.

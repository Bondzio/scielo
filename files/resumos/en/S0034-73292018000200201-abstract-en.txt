Abstract The article analyzes the domestic debate regarding the Brazil-West Germany nuclear agreement of 1975. A number of scientists and opposition politicians sought to use the apparent failings of the agreement to critique the military&#8217;s claims regarding the deal&#8217;s contribution to Brazilian economic development and nuclear status. While limited in its immediate impact, the opposition outlined major themes that would come to the fore later in the decade as Brazilian society began to question the wisdom of the agreement. Concerned with asserting Brazil&#8217;s nuclear autonomy, the opposition&#8217;s efforts also add a new dimension to global narratives of nuclear protest.

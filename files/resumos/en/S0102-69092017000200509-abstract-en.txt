This article is the result of research conducted in the state of Minas Gerais in the biennium 2014/2015. Its aim was to calculate the recidivism rate of the state prison system. Furthermore, we tried to analyze if the profile of recidivists is different from non-recidivists, and also to demonstrate possible explanatory individual factors of recurrence, such as socio-demographic attributes and criminal profile. From data relating to prisoners released in 2008, we identified the likelihood of recidivism within five years after release. The results showed that the chance of reoffend was higher among younger males with extensive criminal reporting, who began this career at an earlier age and who committed crimes against property, especially thefts.

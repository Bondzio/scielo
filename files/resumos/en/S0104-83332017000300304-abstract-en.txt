Abstract In this article, I argue that gender is a central technology by which prison is administered. Considering penitentiaries entrances as borders, as checkpoints, I make a connection between the act of crossing a prison entrance with the historiographies of national borders produced by &#8220;postcolonial&#8221; and transnational feminist literature. From this connection, the article follows an anecdotal tenor, wherewith I aim to demonstrate how feminist critiques focused on the notion of "trafficking of women", may contribute to the analysis of the security and gender devices articulation in the production of power-knowledge discourse on women's prisons.

Abstract: Alfred Schutz tends to be falsely considered as an illustrious representative of social ontological individualism. In this paper, I seek to correct this flawed interpretation of his work by means of a revisitation of his criticism of what I - taking up a Marxian term - call the &#8220;robinsonades&#8221; intrinsic to Husserl's 5th Cartesian Meditation. It is my contention that the systematic reconstruction of this classical criticism makes it possible to lay bare Schutz's actual ontological account, namely: social ontological intersubjectivism.

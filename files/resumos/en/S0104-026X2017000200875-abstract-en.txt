Abstract: In this paper, I seek to confront what I perceive as certain positivist frames of interpretation that are naturalized in contemporary queer theory, in which classical dispositions of the formal, affective and methodological subject/object relation are reproduced and in the process I hope to problematize what we may describe as the mechanisms of epistemic and political objectification present in some recent queer theory. In contrast, through readings of feminist theoretical contributions (especially those of the last few decades of the 20th century), I attempt to trace a theoretical counter-narrative, another epistemic trajectory, which values precisely the mutual implication between subjectivity and objectivity, enabling another way of conceptualizing possible queer critical practices, ones which are embodied and made possible through the signifying, subjective body.

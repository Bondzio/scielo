Introduction </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most studies in agricultural economics explain    the pattern of coordination from the point of view of the markets. Prices and    quantities are the only variables required to perform the analysis, while the    role of institutions is largely ignored. Recent literature has shown that this    approach does not match the reality. Contracts instead of prices are the prevailing    mechanisms of coordination between farming, food processing and consumers (MacDonald,    2006). Moreover, the institutional environment plays a fundamental role in the    formulation of private strategies and of public policies. Contracts prevail    among farmers that form marketing cooperatives, farmers that sell genetically    modified free commodities to traders, and farmers that supply organic food to    supermarkets, just to name few examples. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Contracts perform as sophisticated coordination    devices to handle complex arrangements for horizontal and vertical coordination.    Contracts are common between farmers and processing industries or trading companies,    especially when production of quality attributes depend on the cooperation among    independent agents in the vertical production chain. Horizontal and vertical    coordination devices are built – in to guarantee the regular supply of    products as well as the standards demanded by consumers. In fact, complex network    relations involving simultaneously vertical and horizontal contract relations    represent how agriculture and industry relate to each other. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Coordination mechanisms of quality assurance    have been studied by; Sauv&eacute;e (2000), Farina and Reardon (2000), Raynaud    E. Sauv&eacute;e, L. and Valceschini, E. (2002), and complex vertical contract    mechanisms have also been studied by Menard (1996, 2000), Maze(2005) pointing    to the relevance of specific investments to explain the observed governance    mechanism. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Technological variables cannot by themselves    provide a meaningful explanation for the strategies of firms. Other explanatory    tools are necessary to understand the complex mechanisms that rule modern agro-industrial    relations (Menard, 2002). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since contracts are such an important coordination    device, it is expected that one will need both formal and informal institutional    mechanisms to deal with contract coordination, among them the court mechanism.    Production involving farmers and agro-industries are exposed to considerable    variability demanding sophisticated coordination tools, including exclusion    and dispute solving mechanisms. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The processing industry expects suppliers to    offer quality and quantity in the produce needed. Usually mixed governance forms    are found including markets, contracts and some degree of vertical integration.    When an industry moves geographically, whatever the motivations for this decision    may be, a number of specialized farmers will probably have to adapt, either    by following the industry or by changing their product. This adaptation might    be costly to farmers, to the industry and also to the government, since it usually    requires governmental support for the conversion of farmers. The level of asset    - specific investments determines the cost of adaptation, including human capital.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The location for a processing plant is usually    decided based upon logistic and technological variables. The amount of product    potentially available, the production and distribution costs are all relevant    questions. The literature based on the transaction costs perspective, relates    the choice of governance mechanisms to the transactions characteristics, allowing    for the analysis of complex contractual arrangements. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">From the 1970s to the 1980s, in the Northeast    of Brazil, small farmers supplied tomatoes to a processing industry under pre-specified    contractual conditions. In face of large number of ex-post contract breaches    and in the absence of protection of property rights by local courts, managers    decided to move to new areas where a reduced number of large farmers had been    contracted to supply the industry. The processing industry faced high costs    of production and transactions due to technological factors, aggravated by expensive    private enforcement mechanisms and by the recurrent decision of public courts.    It was observed that when market prices for fresh tomatoes steeped up some farmers    behaved opportunistically, selling the product to the market for fresh consumption,    instead of fulfilling the contractual clauses with the industry. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The contract arrangement was voluntary and the    industry supplied farmers with inputs, including seeds and fertilizers in the    form of ex-ante in – kind payments. In cases of breach of contract and    when private mechanisms did not work, courts have been involved, however they    did not perform as a cost reducing mechanism according to expectations nor did    they provide signals to the players. The companies interviewed, on the contrary,    reported that judges preferred to interpret the breach of contract as the outcome    of the industry’s opportunistic behavior and of the exercise of market    power.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The study presents a qualitative analysis of    the evolution of contractual architecture, complementing this analysis with    a quantitative evaluation of variables based on transaction cost theory related    to the likelihood of breaches of contract. It addresses effects of the differences    in the scale, origin of credit<a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><sup>3</sup></a>,    distance between the farm and the processing plant, and farmers reputation.    The relevant theory is presented in part two, based upon the concept of self-enforcing    range presented by Klein (1992). Part three presents the historic evolution    of the contract relationship. In part four, the panel data study is conducted    with 1,523 observations of contracts between farmers and UNILEVER. Limited dependent    variable and ordinary regression models were formulated to test the hypothesis    based upon the transaction cost theory. Part five presents conclusions together    with subjects suggested for additional research.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This study contributes to the literature of contract    coordination in agro-industrial systems under three aspects: <B>First,</B> it    explores effects of performance by the courts to guarantee the stability of    private contractual arrangements. <B>Second</B>, and distinct from the predominant    research, this study focuses on the analysis of arrangements which have been    discontinued, thereby collecting important information from unsatisfactory performance    while avoiding survivor bias. <B>Third</B>, it gathers historical analysis of    contract design, of evolution and of quantitative analysis of contractual arrangements.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>2. Theoretical Model </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This paper studies the incentives to coordinate    of short-term contracts between farmers and industry. Institutional environment    and characteristics of transactions are the key determinants for efficient contract    arrangement.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Usually farmers are geographically dispersed    and this tends to increase the horizontal coordination costs. <a href="#fig01">Figure    1</a> shows two typical models of agro-industrial relations, where the architecture    in 1a shows the farmers’ collective organization to transact with the    industry and case 1b represents absence of horizontal organization.</font></p>     <p><a name="fig01"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n4/a05fig01.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Two typical structures have been studied in the    literature of networks, as reported in Sauv&eacute;e (op. cit) and Zylbersztajn    and Farina (2003). The choice among the design options depends upon the costs    of horizontal organization and upon the value to be added as a result of specific    investments. Both industry and farmers make specific investments affecting product    characteristics. The value of the final product rests upon investment incentives    and the distribution of rights over residuals.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Problems of observation and measurement costs    may occur in different degrees. First, at the farm level, it might be difficult    to measure a specific quality attribute. Second, prices are defined ex-post    and asymmetries of information might also take place. If transaction costs are    sufficiently high, incentives for total or partial vertical integration are    expected, replacing the price coordination mechanism.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Further elaboration of hybrid forms is offered    by Menard (op. cit.) when studying the alternative arrangements that explain    and support complex coordination mechanisms. The author discusses four basic    mechanisms to deal with the coordination problem, namely: adaptation mechanisms    to deal with price and other non – anticipated changes, risk sharing mechanisms,    information mechanisms and mechanisms for arbitrage. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>2.1. Quasi-Rents and Hold Up</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Considering that transactions correspond to a    transfer of property rights and contract clauses are dependent upon future performance,    the investment of one party will depend upon the other party’s behavior    (Alchian and Woodward, 1988). The joint effort of production involves the risk    of future contract hazards. In the presence of incomplete contracts, parties    might behave opportunistically, benefiting from contract incompleteness. The    existence of specific assets generates transferable quasi-rents that must be    in accordance with safeguards in order to control opportunistic behavior (Klein,    Crawford and Alchian, 1978). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A variety of mechanisms are designed as safeguards,    including the reputation effect and contract clauses against rupture. The efficiency    of these mechanisms relies upon the reliability of the court mechanism and on    the existence of recurrent transactions. In the presence of an efficient court    system, if the parties of the transaction are identifiable and if the transaction    is likely to be repeated in the future, incentives might emerge to comply with    the contract clauses. North (1990) discusses enforcement mechanisms of contracts.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The concept of self-enforcing range is presented    by Klein (1992), and it states that there are both costs and benefits in breaking    the contract. Each party in the transaction will evaluate both these aspects    and the probability of a contract hold-up, stems from this rationale.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The self-enforcing range is defined by the limits    wherein the gains are smaller than the sanctions imposed privately or by the    court system. So, the contract clauses sustained by law (legal coercion), in    addition to the unwritten clauses, act to signal the sanctions imposed to the    agents. In a world of uncertainty, unanticipated events can displace the transaction    out of the self-enforcing range. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The case of tomatoes portrays a situation where    neither private nor public mechanisms have been provided in order to economize    transaction costs for the agents. On one hand, farmers lacked the incentives    to organize horizontally for collective transactions with the industry. No attempts    to add value through specific investments were reported. The industry had contracted    the farmers to supply a given quantity of product, taking into account incentives    for quality. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The relations between farmers and industry did    not evolve on a relational basis. No evidence of trust and an absence of the    reputation effect suggest that the farmers’ perception of the relationship    with the industry was short term oriented. Therefore private enforcement mechanisms    performed poorly, restricting the self-enforcing range of contractual obligations.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">On the other hand, as reported by the industry,    the courts failed to enforce contractual obligations because judges considered    this to be an inequitable relationship, one of a large multinational trading    with small farmers, even under contract. Therefore the contract clauses were    note deemed by the courts as enforceable, thereby further reducing the self-enforcing    range of the contractual obligations. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The resulting increase in the transaction costs    is anticipated by the theory. The benefits to hold-up are greater than the costs    related to court enforcement or to private sanctions related to reputation.    In conclusion farmers have lost and so has the industry.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>2.2. Transaction Cost Analysis</i></b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Transaction Characteristics:</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">From the point of view of the quasi-rents branch    of transaction costs analysis, relevant variables are asset specificity, the    degree of uncertainty that affects the transaction and its frequency. Time specificity    takes place because the quality of the product deteriorates rapidly after harvest.    Post contractual hazards arise, since at peak harvest trucks may have to wait    in line for a long time, which is a common cause of tension between farmers    and industry. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Site specificity is related to transportation:    it affects logistics, monitoring costs and exposes the product to uncontrolled    conditions. In turn, site specificity is affected by the existence of options    to direct the production, which may include competing plants operating in the    same region, or by the existence of alternative crops. Land ownership represents    a higher level of asset specificity than rented land. Moreover the scale of    operations related to a lower monitoring cost is generally preferred by the    industry.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a choice of varieties either for multi-purpose    or specific industrial use. The choice is determined by the available technology.    The farmers favor flexibility while the industry prefers a reduced flexibility.    Most contracts set forth the variety to be grown by the farmers.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Technological specificity is reported, since    farmers have alternative crop options. The level of specialization is expected    to constrain the portfolio of choices as well as the existing technologies for    alternative crops. The same is true for the industry; once equipment is installed    a shortage of supply causes losses due to idle capacity.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Brand specificity is important to the industry,    because competition is strong and the industry values reputation to bear costs    of supply shortages or of sub-standard quality. Uncertainty is present at the    farm level, since uncontrolled weather conditions might affect both quality    and quantity of produce. After processing, uncertainty is mostly related to    market conditions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Opportunism is potentially present in incomplete    contracts, for many dimensions cannot be decoupled or anticipated. Prices were    contracted ex-ante, positive monitoring costs precluded the adoption of technical    controls, and quality standards are usually measured at the industry gate and    are affected by transportation conditions. Contracts have been renewed yearly    so no history of long-term contracts is reported. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The next section presents the analysis of the    evolution of the surveyed arrangements.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>3. Historical Development of Contractual Relations:</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>3.1. Case of Tomato Suppliers:</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Due to specific quality standards, farmers grow    tomatoes to supply the industry according to pre-specified technology. There    are two processing stages after which the product is ready to be marketed as    pulp, ketchup and dressings. Transactions are performed through the system showing    different governance features, from spot markets to vertical integration. Horizontal    coordination has evolved at the farm level because farmers tend to act collectively    to negotiate downstream. The industry has the option of importing concentrated    pulp and farmers have the alternative of supplying the industry or redirecting    production to the market as a fresh product or to further change to another    activity in lieu of tomato production.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Relevant characteristics of agro-industry relations    are: First comes farming mobility. Production of agricultural supplies changes    its location over time for reasons related to technology and transaction costs.    In search of lower production costs, farmers move to regions with better conditions    for production. The economy of transaction costs is another reason to explain    the choices, with this approach largely ignored in the literature.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A second characteristic is that produce can be    consumed either fresh or processed. Different degrees of specific technological    developments, especially in genetics, are made in order to adapt the products    to each target. Third, consumer preferences are important determinants for the    makeup of the final product. Usually, the more rigorous the consumer, the more    specialized is the processing industry and the less flexible the outcome. Brand    emerges as an important asset.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A fourth characteristic is that as a consequence    of government regulatory controls for food safety and consumers’ awareness    of quality attributes at different levels of observance, the coordination mechanism    takes on greater complexity. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B><i>3.2. Evolution of Hybrid Forms</i></B></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Historical evolution of contracts.</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Italian immigrants organized the production of    tomatoes in Brazil around 1920. In the beginning spot markets were sufficient    to supply the small processing plants or, instead, integrated stages of production    were in the hands of families. As production grew in the state of S&atilde;o    Paulo, industrial investments in equipment as well as in brand development took    place and the market structure became more concentrated. Nowadays large multinational    companies supply about 85% of the market. At the beginning of the seventies    public investments in irrigation opened new agricultural frontiers in the semi-arid    areas of the Northeast, especially in the states of Pernambuco and Bahia. As    part of the agrarian reform program many small farmers were settled in the San    Francisco river basin and were offered a new opportunity to produce tomatoes    at low cost, with irrigation. The industry initially located in the State of    S&atilde;o Paulo moved towards this new region. In the nineties the production    area shifted towards the Midwest, followed by the processing plants, especially    to the state of Goi&aacute;s. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The strategy was motivated by technological as    well as by transaction cost reasons. From the seventies through the nineties    new options were made available to the farmers in the Northeast, especially    the option of tropical fruits. The industry blamed farmers for holding-up contracts    when market prices rose, selling the pre-contracted production for fresh consumption    in the market, idling industrial capacity and bringing about coordination costs    along the chain. Slowly the industry decided to contract with fewer farmers    in the new areas, farmers who were farther from the consumption centers and    therefore with less incentive to hold-up. Reputation mechanisms lost coordination    efficiency as more options appeared and the courts failed to exhibit a balanced    record of decisions. This historical perspective shows that mutual trust did    not evolve, horizontal coordination mechanisms were weak and that both production    and transaction costs evolved.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The historical evolution of contracts shows the    adaptation of their design for purposes of the economy of the transaction costs.    The coordination originally based on spot transactions has been replaced by    hybrid mechanisms aiming to reduce uncertainty, to guarantee the delivery of    quantity and quality at the lowest possible logistic and transaction costs.    Complete vertical integration is not the solution due to high risks to locate    the production in large areas and due to the high costs of land. Farmers have    limited choices of technology (including alternative crops) and of different    markets for fresh and industrial products. Industry choices are centered on    the supply of its needs through the smallest number of contracts from farmers    that are as close as possible to the processing plant.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first contract reported in the literature    was found in 1971 in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo. Contracts are also reported    between the industry and traders who were truck owners. They acted as middlemen    by buying production straight from the farm offering future payments.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>First Contract Design</b>: As reported by    Graziano Neto (1977) the original contracts in the State of S&atilde;o Paulo    defined the expected amount to be traded and the price target for payment 90    to 120 days after delivery. Prices were defined ex-ante, before cultivation    by a bureau formed by government and industry without farmer representation.    No R&amp;D investments took place and production risk was borne entirely by    the farmers. Until the eighties, abundant farm credit allowed the industry to    enjoy indirect benefits. Farmers lacked previous experience with the crop in    question, and the activity generated just part of their income. While farmers    became increasingly specialized a market for rent of land developed allowing    for further specialization.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Disputes: Trust did not evolve between farmers    and industry and relational contracts are not reported. Measurement costs were    high due to the lack of standards. Graziano Neto (op. cit.) reports that contracts    were not enforced. In high yield years farmers reported that industry acted    in bad faith by delaying trucks in line for a long time adversely affecting    quality and causing price penalties. Farmers also reported the need to redirect    part of the product to the fresh market in order to guarantee higher average    prices. Industries did not enforce the contracts in an effort to preserve the    relation with the farmers. Whenever they elected enforcement the courts failed    to perform. Bi lateral opportunism reigned.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Second Contract Design</b>: In 1977 a new    committee was organized, including farmers, the food industry and government    agencies. A standard contract was defined and quality standards improved with    the implementation of six levels of quality attributes, with price incentives    applied to each level. It represents a clear move from design type a to type    b, as represented in <a href="#fig01">figure 1</a>.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Clauses protected farmer’ rights by limiting    the waiting time of trucks. Penalties for breach of contract were made explicit    and transportation and package ownership were defined. Nevertheless, weak performance    of contracts persisted and post-contractual costs continued. Property rights    concerning production incurred in high enforcement costs. Some new contract    clauses set a 10% limit on the maximum amount of product to be marketed as fresh.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This standard contract survived with little change    through 1984/1985, as reported by Farina and Cyrillo (1986, op. cit.). It defined    price, area, expected productivity, including premiums/discounts with payment    to be made through commercial paper. Subsidized credit for farmers persisted    and the industry received an indirect benefit. Banks considered the formal contract    collateral for the supply the credit. Farmers contracted the transportation    of the product to the industry and technical assistance was predominantly public.    Frequently the negotiations to define prices overlapped with the planting season.    High transaction costs persisted and distrust remained, as reported by Hoffman    (1985. p.80). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Third Contract Design</b>: In the eighties    governmental budget restrictions cut the level of rural credit, affecting the    contracts between industry and farmers. The industry had to supply credit to    farmers in order to guarantee regularity of supplies, this arrangement still    being the rule. Inputs, including seeds and fertilizers, were supplied by the    industry with costs discounted from the product. At the same time the public    agricultural extension system collapsed and was also assumed by the industry.    This introduced a new feature in the contract, namely the definition of property    rights over the product. Farmers committed formally to deliver 100% of production    to the industry. As reported by Hoffman (op.cit. p.83-85), "…farmers    tend to be the good trustees of the production being responsible for it through    delivery to the industry gate." Farmers could have all the production taken    over by the industry in case of hold - up, enhancing contract enforcement power.    In the nineties, several cases of court enforcement supported by this clause    have been reported in Northeast.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In relation to quality characteristics the industry    restricts flexibility with the growing advances in processing technology. The    industry adopted farmers’ selection based on technological capabilities    as well as strict limits of scale and distance from the processing plant. The    industry increased monitoring efforts.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Fourth Contractual Design</b>: Growers have    been subjected to limited supply of credit and at the same time had to face    a real constraint imposed by the planting season, resulting in tense relations    with industries. Industries moved out from the Northeast in search for less    risk, better product quality, and lower transaction costs. The industry idle    capacity reached 70% in 1995, as reported by Oliveira (1996). Once settled in    Goi&aacute;s, payment for quality attributes was maintained, and the industry    offered technical assistance, seeds and fertilizers to farmers. In the forth    contractual design technology was strictly controlled including farm practices    as choice of varieties and harvesting time. Farmers' rights over the product    were contractually restricted, being responsible for any deviation in the product.    In case of mismanagement of technology by the farmer, the industry was no longer    liable for any contractual clause.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The industry bears bore a larger share of production    risk. There were productivity premiums as well as cumulative price premiums    for continuity, introducing an important reputation effect. Anecdotal evidences    showed a lower level of contract breaches in the Midwest contrariwise to earlier    experience. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some contractual dimensions changed with time.    The trend was toward the definition of specific property rights and the resulting    expected impact was to reduce the enforcement costs of contractual clauses.    Private mechanisms were upgraded in response to the absence of reports on any    evolution of public court enforcement. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A study by Thame and Amaro (1987) reported that    neither farmers nor the processing industry went to court to resolve contract    problems. This bears evidence to the fact that both parties expected costs to    outweigh benefits in the short term, where one-year contracts were the rule.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>4. Quantitative Analysis of Contractual Breaches:</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b><i>4.1. The Data</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Contracts between the industry and tomatoes suppliers    in the region of Petrolina/Juazeiro in the Northeast, between 1996 and 1999    were studied. An unbalanced panel model was designed encompassing five years    of observations, generating 1,523 observations of contracts. The study of the    contracts allowed identification of the variables presented in <a href="#tab01">table    1</a>, defined as: Year of the contract, area contracted in hectares, quantity    contracted in tons, distance from production area to processing plant in kilometers,    quantity effectively delivered, quality standard effectively reported, price    contacted, market price for fresh product, source of credit, bank or industry.    </font></p>     <p><a name="tab01"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n4/a05tab01.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>4.2. The Model: <i>A panel model with random    effects has been applied</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Two model specifications have been designed.    Model 1 used qualitative dependent variables Logit and Probit as described by    Greene (1993) and Gujarati (2000), to capture the occurrence of breach of contract.    Contract breach was defined when the production effectively delivered was less    than 50% of the contracted amount. This limit was set considering that the average    for the period was 40.9%, based upon the expected losses of production due to    technological conditions. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Model 2 defined the dependent variable as the    percentage of product delivered with relation to the total stipulated in the    contract, thereby generating a continuous variable allowing for the use of standard    regression models. Therefore the signals of the estimates are expected to be    the opposite from model 1.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Explanatory variables are; log of distance (dist),    quantity under contract (quant), origin of credit (bank or industry), price    difference which captures the difference between the prices defined in the contract    and the price of the product <I>in natura</I> at harvest time. Explanatory variables    are described in <a href="#tab01">table 1</a>. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dummy variables have been used to capture the    effects of scale and of distance from the plant. Four categories have been created;    G1 are small farmers close to the plant, G2 are small farmers distant from the    plant, G3 are large farmers close to the plant, and G4 are large farmers distant    from the plant.<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><sup>4</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>4.3. Hypothesis: <i>Based on the theory    the following hypothesis was formulated</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is expected that the probability of contracts    breaches is: </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">a) Negatively related to the distance between    farmers and the processing plant since in this case the plant is located in    the urban area, therefore close to the market to which the production can be    channeled. If on one hand monitoring is more intense for farmers close to the    processing plant, on the other hand incentives to channel the production to    the market are stronger, reducing the self enforcing range.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">b) Negatively related with the scale because    the larger the area, monitoring by the industry s expected to be more intense    with greater losses should the farmer breach the contract. Farmers also have    incentives to maintain the relationship with the industry since a large proportion    of their income depends upon the specific channel. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">c) The impact of credit source in the transaction    is twofold. First a negative relation results from reputation losses and sanctions    expected from the bank. It is expected that farmers having access to credit    face additional reputation incentives for their performance. At the same time    it can be argued that farmers have incentives to breach the contract with the    industry, sell the product in the market and repay the loan, thereby upholding    their reputation with the bank. As such, the positive relation with the variable    source of credit is expected in the model of limited dependent variable, meaning    that the reputation effect with the bank is expected to prevail. d) A positive    relation between the differences in prices is to be expected, since it narrows    the contractual self-enforcing range. The larger the price difference the more    incentive farmers have to hold up.<a name="tx05"></a><a href="#nt05"><sup>5</sup></a></font></p>     ]]></body>

Results</i></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="#tab02">Table 2</a> presents the results    from qualitative dependent variable models (model1)<a name="tx06"></a><a href="#nt06"><sup>6</sup></a>,    using polled data, showing equivalent results. Significant coefficients of distance,    origin of credit, quantity contracted and price differences have been found    as well as the dummy variables showing the effects of the different groups.    <a href="#tab03">Table 3</a> presents both expected and observed results.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab02"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n4/a05tab02.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><a name="tab03"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n4/a05tab03.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In both models the scale shows a significant    negative effect on the frequency level of contract breach as expected. Distance    from the processing plant has presented a negative coefficient showing that    the effect of the proximity to the market prevails over the monitoring effect.    Considering that the period under study is characterized by high idle capacity,    farmers close to the market tended to behave opportunistically. The positive    effect of source of credit from the bank in the probability of hold -up indicates    that farmers tend to repay the bank even if sales to the industry have not taken    place as contracted. Therefore the reputation value is greater with the bank    than with the industry.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Positive and significant effect is shown related    to the price difference, confirming the existence of incentives for opportunism    when market prices rise above the prices defined ex-ante. The results of the    dummies allow the analysis of the relation of different groups with the observation    of contractual breaches. The results show that G1 presents smaller probability    of breach than G2, G3 and G4. This might indicate that small farmers are more    dependent on the industry, inviting further consideration of this information.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Model 2 presents the continuous dependent variable    in both models, polled data and panel, and the results are shown in <a href="#tab04">table    4</a>.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab04"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v45n4/a05tab04.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The scale effect is positively related to contract    fulfillment. The positive coefficient between distance and contract fulfillment    indicates that the more distant the farmer, the lesser opportunities he has    to hold-up. The negative signal of the coefficient related to the source of    credit contradicts the previous finding, indicating that farmers prefer to breach    contract with the industry and repay the loan to the bank. This particular point    deserves further analysis.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The dummy variables to capture the effect of    groups also reinforce the results from the limited dependent variable model.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="verdana"><b>5. Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The study of the historical evolution and the    quantitative analysis of contract relations in the Brazilian tomato processing    industry permit to conclude that:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">– Conflicts are present and no relational      contracts evolved. Private enforcement mechanisms are more important than      public mechanisms. Qualitative analysis has shown the weak reputation of court      performance in lowering transaction costs.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">– The geographical relocation of the      processing industry has been motivated both by technical reasons and by economy      in transaction costs.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">– The probability of contract breaches      is greater when the distance between farmers and industry decreases. This      because the particular industrial plant under study was located in town, therefore      close to the market for fresh product.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">– The probability of contract breaches      with industry is greater when the farmer gets credit at the bank. This might      be explained by the stronger enforcement power of banks where farmers have      other contracts.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">– The probability of contract breaches      is higher and increases with the difference between the contract (ex-ante)      prices and the market (ex-post) prices.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">– The probability of contract breaches      declines with scale, indicating that larger farmers tend to be more specialized,      and/or monitoring costs are lower.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Relocation of industries usually is related to    large coordination costs. Especially in the case of the food industry, since    a large number of farmers have made specific investments to enter into a contractual    relationship. The findings of this paper disclose that contractual architecture    changes remarkably over time. Transaction costs motives seem to explain the    observed adaptations. Furthermore, the paper also raised anedoctical evidences    of inefficient public enforcement mechanisms as an instrument to reduce transaction    costs. Costs related to the improvement of the judiciary system must be weighed    against gains in transaction costs however this is a subject for further research.</font></p>     ]]></body>

The contrasts between G1 and G3 and G2 and    G3 are unclear, since the larger scale offers incentives for good performance    but also is more subject to incentives to sell in the market.

Abstract The topic of this article is the generation of women who experienced the introduction of female sterilization as a current practice in Brazil. In interviews on their use of contraceptives, fifteen women from different social backgrounds spoke about their reproductive histories prior to performing the surgery. The interviewees all voluntarily submitted to sterilization between the 1970s and 1980s. The accounts were collected in 2011 and 2012 in the city of Rio de Janeiro and form the material referred to here as 'memories of sterilization.' Two themes emerge from the narratives: the relational dimension influencing the women's decision to undergo sterilization, and the production of the memories of the women concerning reproduction and contraception.

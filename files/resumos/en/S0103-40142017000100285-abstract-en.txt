Abstract Public policies for energy efficiency have been deployed in several countries to reduce energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases. This work aims to analyze Brazilian public policies promoting energy efficiency, as well as related challenges and opportunities. It has been shown that governments must develop strategic energy planning, with measures to promote energy management and generate awareness both to the demand and supply sides of the economy and to reduce the risk of another energy crisis in Brazil, as happened in recent past.

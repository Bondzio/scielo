Advertising in Brazil, both as business and as profession, expanded tremendously in the 40s, 50s and 60s. The arrival of American agencies bringing a more sophisticated standard of work, the rapid and vigorous entrance of radio and TV and the subordination of printed and electronic media to advertising revenue are factors that defined a phase of remarkable optimism and hope for advertising professionals. The article compares the concepts and aspirations that guided the creation, in 1951, of the first advertising school in SÃ£o Paulo,today's Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing - ESPM - [Graduate School of Advertising and Marketing], with the complaints and indetermination concerning what should guide currently pasteurized publicity teaching. It points out economical and symbolical interests that help to understand why advertising agencies seem far distant from schools.

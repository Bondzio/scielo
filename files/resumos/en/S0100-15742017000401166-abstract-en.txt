ABSTRACT The article presents results of a study that aimed to analyze the current state of the teaching of didactics in teaching certification programs, and its contribution to the process of preparing the teaching professional. The theoretical framework is developed based on Rold√£o, Shulman, Gauthier, Cochran-Smith and Lytle. The methodology used involved: a curricular analysis developed for the programs investigated; a questionnaire applied to the students that had completed approximately 70% of the curriculum; and, the creation of four discussion groups. The results indicate greater political, rather than methodological, emphasis in the teaching of didactics, expressed in the topics covered, in the course given and in the relationship with the teacher-trainer. The need for teaching focused on the public schools, on basic education and on the teaching profession is evident.

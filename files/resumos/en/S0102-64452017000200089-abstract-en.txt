Abstract In this essay, we support the thesis of the importance and currentness of Leandro Konder&#8217;s thoughts, aiming its conception of dialectic. Here, it is mainly understood as dialogue, self-criticism and transformation. We draw the conclusion that the &#8216;konderiana&#8217; dialectic should inspire us to think and transform the current context of the overall right wing political party advance, mainly in Latin America and Brazil. Since there is undeniably, at the same time, a kind of return of the dialectic, in terms of recrudescence of Marx&#8217;s theory and social movements, two and half decades just after the abrupt and presumptuous decree of the &#8220;end of the history&#8221;.

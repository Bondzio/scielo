This article aims at investigating how the idea of democracy is differently signified by participants of the 2013 Brazilian June Journeys. Methodologically, the article is grounded on 50 interviews conducted in the cities of SÃ£o Paulo and Belo Horizonte. The participants were selected from an initial map of groups centrally involved in these street protests, which was further developed through snowball sampling. The analysis is based on seven key dimensions: (1) popular authorization for the exercise of political power; (2) participation and self-government; (3) monitoring of political power by demonstrators; (4) promotion of equality and defense of oppressed groups; (5) political competition and pluralism; (6) discussion of opinions; (7) advocacy of the common good. The qualitative analysis of discursive content seeks to evince the ways in which such dimensions are understood, debated, criticized and/or advocated by the interviewees.

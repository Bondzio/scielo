This work discusses the Brazilian feminist press. Based on field research, it shows that the feminist press after-1974 can be divided in two different moments: first and second generations. The first is mainly worried with social class questions and social differences, and the second is mainly focused on genre questions. Two historical events mark the division between the first and the second generation of feminist periodicals: the II and the III SÃ£o Paulo State Woman Congress, that happened, respectively, in 1980 and 1981.

Abstract: The complexity and expansion of environmental issues have caused the state to lose its decision-making exclusivity in this area. Currently multiple actors and agencies contribute to environmental governance, especially in the realm of local governance thanks to their paradiplomacy. In this article, paradiplomacy is understood as a tool that allows operationalizing environmental governance. Governments often face technical, scientific and financial difficulties but at the same time have opportunities due to their proximity to their citizens and better territorial knowledge. As an example, two experiences are presented that serve to prove how paradiplomacy has contributed to environmental governance and management, as much as in cities nets related to integration processes' (the Unidad Tem√°tica Ambiental y Desarrollo Sostenible of the Mercociudades Network and the Covenant of Mayors against the Climate Change of the European Union) as well as through the cross border cooperation.

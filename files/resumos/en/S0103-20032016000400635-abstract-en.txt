Abstract: The exodus or the permanence of young people in rural areas is a highly debated topic in Latin America. This work aims to contribute to this discussion based on an empirical research with a survey of 400 young people in Argentina. This study shows how different variables influence in keeping young people in rural areas engaging in agriculture activities. The hypothesis that arises and that is finally validated is that belonging to farming families and studies related to agricultural activity are the key factors that allow young people to settle in rural areas and engage in agriculture. The statistical techniques used for descriptive analysis are contingency tables and comparison of means, while the multiple binary logistic regressions are used to perform dependency analysis and validate the hypothesis.

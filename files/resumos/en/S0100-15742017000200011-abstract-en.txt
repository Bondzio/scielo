ABSTRACT This article aims to investigate the reflexive use of mixed methods, i.e., those that combine quantitative and qualitative approaches in the same research in order to conduct the empirical stage of the study. After describing the general characteristics and main criticisms, we present the least number of elements that we believe should be made explicit in the use of mixed methods to ensure rigor in research and epistemological coherence. Later, we present an illustration of the operationalization and application of mixed methodologies in educational research that addresses professional difficulties that arise in the daily work of specialized agriculture teachers.

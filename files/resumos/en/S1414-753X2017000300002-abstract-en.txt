Abstract Models based on a multidimensional structure of environmental attitudes are more appropriate than one-dimensional or dichotomic approaches when assessing the complex relationships people have with the natural environment. This work explores a model of environmental concern composed of four attitudinal dimensions (apathy, anthropocentrism, connectivity and emotional affinity), analyzing their relationships with pro-environmental behaviors. The sample consisted of 250 students from a university that represents the most popular strata of the population, being people more susceptible to financial problems and more easily affected by adverse economic situations. The results obtained with Partial Least Square (PLS) show the validity and reliability of the proposed model, and reveal that this group believes it is possible to reconcile economic growth with environmental preservation. The results show, in addition, which strategies can be worked to increase environmental awareness related to energy saving, waste management and green consumption.

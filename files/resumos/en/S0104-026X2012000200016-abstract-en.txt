The aim of this paper is to discuss the category of "monster" and its close relation with the pathologization and criminalization of people seen as "sexual deviants", especially transvestites, transsexuals and intersex. At the beginning of the XXI century, with the questioning of medical authority, the politicization of the social movements of transvestites and transsexuals and their battle for despathologization, where to direct the "disorders" of sex or gender, "paraphilias'" and "perversions" with all the persistent stigma attached to them? Will they be understood again as potentially dangerous by the increasingly widespread culture of security?

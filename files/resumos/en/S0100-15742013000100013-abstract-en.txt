In this paper, we analyze how gender permeates the practices of caring, organizing and controling the home, and how they shape mathematical practices. The empirical material used for this purpose was produced in the warehouse of an association for collectors of recyclable materials. It is constituted of recordings from classrooms, pedagogical workshops, and episodes that we witnessed, as well as interviews. The theoretical basis and methodology used establishes a dialogue between studies of gender and numeracy practices, and Michel Foucault's contributions to the field of discourse. The attention that we dedicate to mathematical practices in this study is motivated by the variety of the situations at home and at school, naturalizing and institutionalizing - under the aegis of the Cartesian matrix - gender differentiations and inequalities.

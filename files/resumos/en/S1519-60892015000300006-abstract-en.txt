Abstract: Abstract: The new migrant identities, the issue of circulation at a time in history that seems to be marked by the flow, the relativization of time-space coordinates, the recycling of patterns, and the construction/deconstruction of cultures in motion or mobility cultures, necessarily result in the emergence of phenomena that constitute themselves in and by interculturality and transmigrations. Asking about the &#8220;gringo&#8221; person&#8217;s speech (discourse) that has been constituted at the pampas in the province of Santa Fe through texts and discourses is what, for some time, we have suggested to study in all its aspects, and, at the same time, the new migrations to and from Italy from our cultural «zone». This text intends to &#8220;listen&#8221; to the silenced voices about the immigration phenomenon from texts&#8217; retrieval that manage prominent glances: the Beck Bernard&#8217;s related to the Pampa Gringa and the Italian writer Laura Pariani&#8217;s, texts about Italian immigration from/to Latin America.

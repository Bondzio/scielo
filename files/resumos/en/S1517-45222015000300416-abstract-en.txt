This book tries to clear why west societies do not get happier while turning richer. The hypothesis is that individualism failed. Its main statement suggests that if we really want happiness we need a concept of common good to contribute: it requires self-care and care of the other. The philosophy of Jeremy Bentham, which states that the best policy is that which produces more happiness, offers the frame for all Layard assessments.

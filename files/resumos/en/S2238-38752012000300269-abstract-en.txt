Abstract: This article is an introduction to "Os estudos sociais e a mudan√ßa social no Brasil", written by Luiz Aguiar da Costa Pinto as the first chapter of a report sent to CAPES about the situation of sociology in Brazil. In order to guide the reader of this document, I reconstructed briefly some aspects of Costa Pinto trajectory in Brazilian sociology. Also, I try to establish some comparative remarks between this report and other accounts about sociology made in the fifties. For instance, in the report of Costa Pinto the experience of Estado Novo, that changed considerably the path of academic life in Rio de Janeiro, figures as a central component of the author's arguments, as we can note through the notion of "structural marginality".

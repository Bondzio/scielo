Abstract This paper analyzes how the issue of drug trafficking is incorporated into the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) agenda. The analysis is based on the theoretical framework presented by the Copenhagen School of security studies, specifically (De)Securitization Theory (BUZAN et al., 1998). Thus, we argue: the UNASUR, through two thematic councils (the South American Defense Council and the South American Council for the Global Drug Problem) initiated the process of desecuritization of drug trafficking at the regional level. The Union of South American Nations, therefore, has advanced in discussing the problem of drug trafficking in the region, seeking to expand the approach to the topic while presenting itself as an alternative to the U.S. militaristic model for combating drug trafficking.

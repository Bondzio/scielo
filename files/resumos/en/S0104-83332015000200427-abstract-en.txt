AbstractThe article unfolds from a doctoral thesis that examined a public policy for the promotion of a Better First Childhood (PIM/RS, Brazil), taking it as a pedagogical instance that pursues to educate and regulate women and men as mothers and fathers of certain types. Specifically, the focus, from the perspective of gender studies and Foucauldian studies, is on the senses articulated to the use of the term knowledge and to its effects on the production of three subject positions (visiting women, voluntary women, community women) promoted by such policy.

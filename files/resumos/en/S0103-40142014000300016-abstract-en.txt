Enrico Fermi was one of the greater physicists of the XX century. In 1934, he gave several lectures in Brazil. Invited by Theodoro Ramos to work in São Paulo, he preferred to stay in Rome and went to the USA in 1938. However, Fermi recommended Gleb Wataghin to come in his place. Wataghin made history in Brazil, becoming one of the first Professors of the future São Paulo University. Besides his relevance to the History of Science, Fermi eventually leaved an indelible mark on the creation and institutionalization of national scientific research due to the indication of Wataghin. Despite this fact, very little is known about Fermi's trip to Brazil. This work tries to reconstruct the fullest possible steps of the famous Italian physicist in our lands.

This paper discusses the experience of Residence in Public Policy - RPP - offered within the public policy graduate program at University of Brasilia. RPP involves relevant methodological innovations applied within the supervised training. The students are taken into government agencies to conduct research. This article shows the results of a descriptive and evaluative effort regarding the methodology used to develop the Residence, and its preliminary results. We have investigated the perception of the students of the first class of RPP and also the perception of the receiving organizations. With regard to students, there was full achievement of the objectives of RPP; with regard to the receiving organizations, satisfactory engagement was found, even though there were some procedural difficulties.

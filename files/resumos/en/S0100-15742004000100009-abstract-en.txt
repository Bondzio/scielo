This study analyses the dynamics of the municipalization of education after the 80's. Firstly, we sought to draw the lines of educational policies that recommend democratization, by focusing on the conditions to expand educational opportunities in some municipalities in the State of Santa Catarina. Next, we developed a schematic drawing for sociological interpretation, highlighting some underlying logic in these educational policies, such as: the segregationist logic related to excluding pedagogical processes; the integrator logic that refers to the merit principle, which tries to explain the positions of individuals in different social groups; the decentralizing logic aiming at redirecting the dominant decision making power in educational systems; the municipalist logic associated to democratization and to the sharing of responsibilities regarding elementary schooling.

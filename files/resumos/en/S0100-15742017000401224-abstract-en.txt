ABSTRACT The present article is based on a study conducted in 2015. The study dealt with a process of identification and categorization of policies and programs of induction into the teaching profession in Latin America, with particular emphasis on the situation in Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru and The Dominican Republic. The article examines evidence collected in interviews with key sources, as well as in reports and studies. The five cases examined were analyzed in a comparative manner, triangulating them with the international and regional literature that supports the study. It is concluded that the cases examined could be inspirational for other Latin American countries interested in formally supporting the induction of new teachers into the classrooms.

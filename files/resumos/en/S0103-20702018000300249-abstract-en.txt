Abstract In a small city from the state of Pernambuco, local people involved in historical disputes have attracted attention due changes in their characteristic way of socialization before new settings. Conflicts that have profoundly marked the history and biographies of the city, now seem to be implied amid changes by public policy of external origin. Considering the importance of values and practices in face of external and macro-social influences, social actors have challenged analytical readings about their specific modes of dialogue with traditions and modernizations. From this perspective, this research proposes to analyse the complexity of local dynamics, taking into account on in one hand, the familiar modes of action and, on the other, the way how this symbolic local structure responds to external interventions.

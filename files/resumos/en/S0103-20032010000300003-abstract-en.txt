The H5N1 avian influenza virus has been spreading fast over countries and continents in the last years, with a real possibility of reaching Brazil. The scope of this paper is to analyze the impacts of three different scenarios of a possible bird flu outbreak in commercial poultry production in Brazil, with the aid of a Brazilian inter-regional general equilibrium model. Results point to a greater negative impact over the production in the Southern region, with the correspondent negative impact in the broad regional economies. Regions producing substitute goods, on the other hand, would be benefited, due to consumer's substitution towards other meats. Actually, the substitution effect caused by the change in consumer's preferences, both domestically and abroad, is found to be the key driver of the regional income and employment changes.

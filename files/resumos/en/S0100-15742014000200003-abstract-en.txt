The implementation of a training and work program for female domestic workers in a municipality of the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires is analysed with focus on how gender inequity issues are discussed in this context. The program aims to provoke a reflection regarding gender-related employment characteristics, the devaluation of domestic work, and to denaturalize the traditional female roles. The characteristics of the program and the gender perspective it adopts, as well as its functioning, practices and representations will be analyzed here based on a qualitative study.

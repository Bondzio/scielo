Abstract This article focuses on the quilombo as a socio-anthropological concept in order to discuss Us theoretical and political implications, principally those linked to social exclusion in Brazil. It aims at establishing a counterpoint between the present problems involved in the interpretation of article 68 of the Brazilian Constitution, on communities descended from runaway slaves, and the strategies applied to implement this article which include, among others, the folklorization of negro culture and negro identity, it also points out the necessity to develop new points of reference in order to overcome a certain theoretical reductionism regarding the anthropological implications of specific rights especially in face of the pitfalls of folklorization.

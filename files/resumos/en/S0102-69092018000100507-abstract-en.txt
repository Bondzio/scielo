The work aims to discuss effects of the resources of the Bolsa Fam√≠lia Program (BFP) and the Continuous Cash Benefit (CCB) allocated in local social and economic dynamics. In this sense, a case study was conducted in Passa Tempo - MG with two foci: the actions developed by private charitable organizations and the buying habits of the families who receive these benefits. The results show that allocated federal funds in question have provoked adjustments in the performance of charities to contribute towards reducing the volume of their demands. Moreover, being directed to the poor and extremely poor, they foment dynamics associated to the consumption of goods and services of a private nature. It concludes that the existence of non-contributory benefits represents the strengthening of state action in the perspective of social welfare. This generated the re-accommodation of charitable action groups, exemplified, in the case of Passa Tempo, by the Vincentian conferences and by the parish.

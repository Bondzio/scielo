In this article, we discuss how the political and discursive fights develop according to the significance of a curriculum based on post-structural authors and interpretations that we make from these theoretical records in the curriculum field in Brazil. The proposed debate questions the policies of the teacher training curriculum oriented to the perspective of social change. We present the discussion through four interconnected theses: teacher training is an impossible project; yet this teacher training is required; this need can be linked to the project that for many seems abandoned: the project of changing the world; the challenge of change involves our responsibility and commitment, as well as the constant political debate about what is understood as change and meaning in the world.

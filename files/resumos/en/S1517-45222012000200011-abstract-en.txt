This paper analyses the development of public policies on nanotechnology (NT) in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Two main distinctive features were detected, although with different levels of presence in each country. The first feature is the creation of centers of scientific excellence integrated with industry, with the aim of increasing international competitiveness. The second feature is the lack of attention to social issues involved in this technological revolution, such as educating the workforce, protecting consumers and workers from potential risks, and promoting the participation of social organizations into public policy decisions.

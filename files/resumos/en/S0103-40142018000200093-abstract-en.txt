Abstract It is known that literary reading is an object of teaching in schools, whereas literary writing is absent, as has been shown by educational research and training reports. Considering this reality, this paper aims to analyze how the reader&#8217;s dimension may feed the author&#8217;s work, assuming that the introjection of an interlocutor may transform and enhance texts of artistic intent. We have in mind contemporary youth cultural, as well as social reading and writing practices of children and young people that can - and should - be appropriated by the school to transform school practices.

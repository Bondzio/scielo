<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><a name="tx02"></a><b>1. Introduction<a href="#nt02"><sup>2</sup></a></b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Farm Bill of 1996, the Federal Agriculture    Improvement and Reform (Fair) Act, introduced significant changes in U.S. agricultural    policy. This partial reform of agricultural policy was an attempt to reduce    budget expenditures and to meet agreements signed in the Uruguay Round. Traditional    types of assistance, mostly based on current production and market conditions,    were discontinued in favor of decoupled payments (called production flexibility    contracts, PFC) not associated with current production or area. All acreage    restrictions were eliminated. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With the fall in prices after 1997, U.S. government    expenditures with <i>Amber Box</i> support (not excluding de <i>minimis</i>    exemptions) went from US$ 7 billions in 1997, to US$ 14 billion in 1998, to    US$ 23 billion in 1999 and fell slightly to US$ 21 billion in 2000 (Hart and    Babcock, <a href="#tab02">Table 2</a>, p. 10). Support for soybeans under this    category increased from almost zero in 1997 to US$ 1.3 billion in 1998, to US$    2.8 billion in 1999 and 2000.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Payments based on historical programs (the same    as the PFCs), which have replaced the old Loan Deficiency Payments, have been    another major component of U.S. support to agriculture. Expenditures under this    heading went from US$ 5.2 billion in 1996, to US$ 6.3 billion in 1997, to US$    8.4 billion in 1998, to US$ 10.9 billion in 1999 and have fallen slightly to    US$ 10.5 billion in 2000 (OECD).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Soybeans have benefited from the U.S. commodity    loan programs since 1941, but were not subjected to the acreage restrictions    imposed on feed grains, rice, wheat and upland cotton (Westcott and Price, p.15).    In most of the period after 1970 market prices have been above the loan rate    and the main benefit of the program was to provide liquidity to farmers until    production was sold. This was not the case before 1970 and in the middle of    the decade of the 1980s (see Westcott and Price pp. 16 and 17).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The marketing loan program in the U.S. started    in 1986 for rice and upland crop and was extended to soybeans and other oilseeds    in 1991 (Westcott and Price, p.3) and to wheat and feed grains in 1993. The    Fair Act continued the market loan program for these crops.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The PFC payments, introduced by the Fair Act,    were an attempt to move towards income support rather than price support. Producers    of commodities previously eligible for deficiency payments were entitled to    payments based the area planted with such crops during the 5-year period previous    to 1996. Soybeans were not eligible for PFC payments.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The PFC payments have been considered by U.S.    policy makers and by the WTO official decoupled with no or small effect on current    production and on trade. However, time has shown that what seemed true in principle    was not so in practice. With the elimination of acreage controls the PFC payments    provided extra operating capital that allowed farmers to expand area. This took    place for products that had higher returns per hectare. The increase in the    loan rate for soybeans US$ 5.26 per bushel in the 1997/98 marketing year triggered    a substantial expansion of soybean acreage at the expenses of other crops, mainly    wheat. But the production and trade distortions became even more evident with    the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA) of 2002 that allowed changes    in base acreage and yield and, as such, introduced an expectation element in    the farmers decision process. In other words, farmers that grow soybeans (and    other products included in the policy) now will be eligible to receive the subsidies    of the 2008 Farm Bill. That is, tomorrows subsidies induce more production,    more exports and lower world prices today. This is clearly a non-decoupled form    of domestic support.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After 1999 the U.S. government introduced direct    payments to soybean producers (the Oilseed Program). These payments were introduced    after marketing loss assistance was granted to other crops and they are based    on past areas and yields. Nevertheless, these payments have effects that are    similar to the PFCs and are likely to raise current production in the U.S.,    raise U.S. exports and further reduce world prices of soybeans.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act (FSRIA)    of 2002 did not change principles embedded in the earlier policy and introduced    counter cyclical payments that provide a guarantee against low prices. Again    these payments are based on past acreage and yield, but through expectations    they will increase U.S. production and exports and will depress world prices    in the present.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this paper we assess the effects of the U.S.    domestic support to soybeans and its consequences to world prices and to Brazilian    production and exports. To achieve this we first built an econometric model    of the world soybean market. The counter factual analysis consisted of the elimination    of the U.S. domestic support to soybeans and to track the impacts on the variables    of interest.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The paper is organized as follows: section 2    presents stylized facts about the production of soybeans in the U.S. and Brazil;    section 3 describes the U.S. Marketing Assistance Loan Program and other policies    that have distorting effects on production, trade and world prices; section    4 lays down the principal characteristics of the econometric model used to estimate    the impact of domestic support in the U.S. on world prices and Brazilian production    and exports; section 5 contains the principal results and section 6 concludes    the paper.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>2. Stylized facts</B></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">U.S. acreage for products where area was tied    to deficiency payments before the Fair Act decreased substantially after 1996.    Between 1996 and 2000 area reductions were as follows: corn 1.9 million hectares;    wheat 5.0 million hectares; sorghum 1.6 million hectares; and barley 506 thousand    hectares. During the same period the increase in soybeans area was 4.2 million    hectares<a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><sup>3</sup></a>, which shows that    the change in legislation had a major impact on the area planted with this crop.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Production of soybeans increased mostly because    of area, since yields did not change during this period<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><sup>4</sup></a>.    This is seen in <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a> that displays area, production    and yield for the period 1979/2001. Production increased 17 percent between    1996 and 2001, area increased 19 percent and yield, declined 1 percent over    the same period<a name="tx05"></a><a href="#nt05"><sup>5</sup></a>. Figure 1,    which is based on indices of three-year averages, shows the same data.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The corresponding data for Brazil are shown in    <a href="#tab02">Table 2</a> and Figure 2, where it can be seen the strong expansion    of both area and yield during the same period. But the key difference is that    domestic support has not changed at all during this period in Brazil, while    this was not the case in the U.S.. A significant policy change that took place    recently in Brazil was the elimination of the value added tax (ICMS) on exports    of agricultural and semi processed goods in 1996. In other words, market forces    have driven the strong performance displayed by the sector in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Figure 3 shows the volume of U.S. soybeans exports    since 1990. After the loan rate was raised to US$ 5.26 per bushel in the 1997/1998-crop    year exports have jumped, increasing 11 percent between 1997 and 1999 and 21    percent between 1998 and 1999. U.S. exports have been expanding since 1990,    as figure 3 shows; however, from 1998 to 2001 they have shown additional vigor.    This is particularly disturbing in light of the fact that the U.S. dollar has    become stronger over this period, that world prices have been declining and    that yields have not increased (Figure 4 shows export volumes and yield indices).    </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These elements show clearly that marketing assistance    loan program have played a major role to explain the evolution of production    and exports. In other words, while in Brazil the market has been the driving    force behind the expansion of the soybean sector, in the U.S. the recent expansion    is induced by government expenditures to support the sector.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>3. The U.S. Marketing Loan Assistance,    Fixed Payments and Counter Cyclical Payments</B></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The US <u>Marketing Loan Assistance Program</u>    operates through two instruments:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Loan Rates; and    <br>    Marketing Loans.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Loan Rates.</b> The Marketing Loans for soybeans    started in 1991. Before their introduction only Loan Rates were available. These    allow soybean farmers to borrow from the government with production pledged    as loan collateral. The loan value is determined by a crop specific loan rate    per unit of production. Farmers can borrow anytime after harvest through May    31. Most of the operations occur shortly after harvest when prices are seasonally    low.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Loan repayment can be made in either of the forms    below:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> payment of the principal plus interest; or    <br>    forfeiting ownership of the loan collateral and keeping the proceeds of the    loan.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Marketing Loans.</b> Marketing loans changed    significantly the operation of the program. Farmers are allowed to repay the    loans at prices below the original loan rate plus interest. This is likely to    occur when market prices are below the loan rates.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With marketing loans the government accumulation    of stocks is reduced, since farmers retain ownership of production and sell    directly on the market. In consequence the policy has removed the price support    mechanism embedded in the Loan Program before.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The benefits of the program to farmers are granted    through two different channels:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Loan Program. In this case production is pledged    as collateral for the loan in the same form described before. But farmers can    repay the loan, at anytime during the loan period, at market prices. For soybeans    the repayment prices are posted county prices that are calculated daily. The    difference between the Loan Rate and the county prices represents a benefit    of the program for producers. Notice also that no interest accrues on the loan    when the loan repayment rate is below the loan rate plus interest.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Loan Deficiency Payment (LDP). In this case    farmers do not take any loans and the benefit of the program is the difference    between the loan rate and the county prices. If an LDP is paid on portion of    a crop it is no longer eligible for a loan.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The benefits of the Marketing Loan feature of    the program have been, on average, higher than described above. This is due    to the fact that farmers retain ownership of production and to the fact that    the Loan Rate no longer provides price support. Thus the decision to take the    benefit of the Marketing Loan is independent of the decision to sell production.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Typically a farmer will take the benefit of the    program at the time market prices are seasonally at the lowest point and sell    the crop later when prices are high again. Westcott and Price conclude the following    from this:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>Raising the realized per-unit revenue above      the loan rate also increases the economic incentive to plant crops. This further      encourages producers to plant more land to supported crops than they otherwise      would and, as discussed earlier, may also influence the mix of crops planted.</i>      (p. 7)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Based on 1999 information, Westcott and Price    (p.8) show the following for soybeans:</font></p> <table width="580" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">   <tr>      <td width="300" valign="top">     ]]></body>

In 2000, however,      relatively large marketing loan benefits for corn pull away land from soybeans."      (p. 17)    <br>     "Exports of soybeans are increased through 2004, except in 2000 when      corn program benefits lead to lower soybean plantings. Exports of soybean      meal and soybean oil rise as well when soybean acreage increases as higher      domestic crush of soybeans leads to higher production and lower prices in      soybean product market." (p. 17)    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<br>     "...when marketing loan benefits shift land into soybeans (2001 through      2004) prices for soybeans are reduced, with the largest impact of 49 cents      occurring in 2001 when acreage gains for the crop are highest."

The impact of these two subsidies on production and exports depend on expectations    regarding the next farm bill in 2007 and, as such, their effects may be smaller    than those indicated in the simulations below.

The average increase in world prices increase over the period 1998/2004 in 3.95    percent, with highest values, of the order of 7 percent, in 2000 and in 2001    when the marketing loan payments were at their peak. It is seen that producer    prices in the U.S. are reduced on average 11.48 percent and Brazilian prices    increase by about 3.81 percent, in line with the change in world prices.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It must be noted that the world price changes    estimated by the model are in line with those obtained in other studies, such    as those of Westcott and Price (1999, 2001) and the OECD Agricultural Outlook    (2000). The fact that removing large subsidies to commodities does not cause    large impacts on market prices is well known and documented in the literature,    as noted by Vald&eacute;s and Foster (2002). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The changes in world oil and meal prices are    seen in <a href="#tab05">Table 5</a>. The average impact on oil prices is quite    surprising, since it is even higher than the impact on grain prices. This is    caused by the large reduction on crushing in the U.S. and by the small effect    on domestic consumption. Meal prices, on the other hand, increase less than    soybean world prices.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="#tab06">Table 6</a> shows the impacts    on soybeans production in Argentina, Brazil and the U.S.. There is a reduction    of approximately 30 million tons during the period 1998/2004 in the U.S. production    of soybeans, which correspond to approximately 5.3 percent of the production    estimated in the baseline. This is, in part, compensated by increases in Argentina    and Brazil of the order of 4 percent in each country. The largest impacts on    Brazil take place during the period 2001 and 2003, where production losses between    2 and 2.5 million tons per year.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="#tab07">Tables 7</a>, <a href="#tab08">8</a>    and <a href="#tab09">9</a> show the corresponding impacts on soybean oil production,    soybean meal production and in soybean crushing. These impacts are in line with    the changes observed in world prices and in soybeans production. Notice that    the impact on Brazil is quite significant compared with that of Argentina and    of the European Union.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In summary, the analysis of these tables indicate    that the removal of the marketing loan assistance in the U.S. will have favorable    impacts on soybean production as well as on the domestic crushing industry.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a href="#tab10">Tables 10 to 13</a> show net    exports. The results indicate again that the impact of the removal of this subsidy    on the world market is significant. Exports from the U.S. would be smaller (about    3 million tons in 2002) and those of Brazil and Argentina increased. In Brazil    the highest impact is in 2001, about 2 million tons, and the impact, during    the period 1998/2004, is of the order of 7 million tons. The impact on the value    of exports, as seen in <a href="#tab11">Table 11</a>, is close to US$ 2 billion    dollars, with the largest values (US$ 450 and US$ 382 millions) concentrated    in 2001 and 2002.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By the total value of net exports of the soybean    complex are larger, since Brazilian exports of soybean oil and soybean meal    will increase too. The total effect reaches the value of US$ 751 million in    2001, dropping to US 699 millions in 2002. The total increment of exports of    the soybean complex during the period is US$ 3 billion.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These results illustrate another perverse aspect    of the current concepts used in the WTO regarding export subsidies. The marketing    loan assistance is defined as domestic support (Amber Box). However, its impacts    on U.S. exports are large relative to the change in production, as the following    analysis shows. Total reduction in production in the U.S. over the period 1998/2004    is of the order of 30 million tons. This is turn lead to a reduction of about    14 million tons in crushing and 14 million tons in exports of soybeans. That    is, 50 percent of the effect on production influences directly exports. The    50 percent directed to additional crushing also finds its way to the world markets    through more exports of soybean oil and soybean meal. Thus, this program contains    an important element of export subsidy that is ignored by the current definitions    adopted in the WTO.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Scenario 2.</b> <a href="#tab14">Tables 14    to 23</a> contain results of simulations. The results encountered in this scenario    do not differ qualitatively of those found in Scenario 1. The difference in    the simulation between the two is that we have included fixed payments and counter    cyclical payments as if they were not decoupled. As noted before, there is clearly    an impact on production and trade induced by these policies that works through    an expectation mechanism induced by the fact that the 2007 farm bill is likely    to allow revisions of acreage and yield and only farmers who are now producing    will be eligible for the revisions. To capture this mechanism in an econometric    model is not easy and not feasible since the data is not yet available. In view    of this difficulty, the authors agreed to simulate the effect of the removal    of these policies as if they were not decoupled. This is likely to provide an    upper bound for the actual impacts of the change in policy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is not necessary to analyze <a href="#tab14">Tables    14 to 23</a> in detail since the nature of the results is similar. Nevertheless,    we emphasize the points below.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> World price of soybeans increase by a maximum    of 9 percent in 2000 and the increase remains above 7 percent in 2001 and 2002.    <br>    Producer prices in the U.S. are reduced 16 percent on average, with values    as high as 20 percent towards the end of the period.    <br>    Brazilian losses due to the policy can be summarized as follows: production    of soybeans is reduced by almost 13 million tons during the period 1998/2004;    during the same period net exports of soybeans are reduced by 9 million tons,    equivalent to US$ 2.2 billion; and net exports of the soybean complex are reduced    by US$ 4 billions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><b>6. Summary</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This paper has analyzed the impact of the current    U.S. policy for soybeans on Brazilian production and trade of soybean and soybean    products. The main findings of the study were:</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The elimination of the domestic support to    soybeans will increase world prices of soybeans and of soybean products. The    average increase in soybean prices during the period 1998/2004 varies between    4 and 5 percent according to the liberalization scenario considered. The maximum    increase in prices occurs in 2000 and 2001, when the marketing loan program    provided the highest levels of support.    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<br>    Brazilian production over the entire period is reduced between 10 and 13 million    tons.    <br>    Exports of soybeans are reduced between 7 and 9 million tons, equivalent to    US$ 1.6 to US$ 2.2 billion.    <br>    Exports of the soybean complex are reduced between US$ 3 and US$ 4 billion    dollars.    <br>    This domestic support provided by U.S. policy has a significant impact on    trade, since about 50 percent of the increase in soybean production will be    exported directly. But the total impact is even greater since exports of soybean    meal and soybean oil will take place too.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In conclusion this subsidy is causing damage    to Brazilian producers and exporters. Governmental initiatives leading to the    elimination of this type of support are important not only because of the estimated    impacts but because these policies are likely to continue and cumulative effects    can cause distress in the sector, with reductions in income and employment.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>7.

<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="nt01"></a><a href="#title">1</a> This    paper has been prepared at the request of the Confedera&ccedil;&atilde;o Nacional    da Agricultura e Pecu&aacute;ria do Brasil (CNA) as a partial fulfillment of    agreement nº 21.010.830/2001-12 signed by the CNA and the Minist&eacute;rio    da Agricultura, Pecu&aacute;ria e Abastecimento to assess the effects of U.S.    domestic support to soybeans on the Brazilian soybean sector. The authors want    to express their gratitude to several people and institutions: the participants    of the various meetings and seminars headed by Pedro de Camargo Netto who was    then Secretary of Production and Marketing, Minist&eacute;rio da Agricultura    e do Abastecimento; to ABIOVE staff who shared information and knowledge of    U.S. policy with us; to Guilherme Leite da Silva Dias, S&aacute;vio Pereira,    Get&uacute;lio Pernambuco and F&aacute;bio Trigueirinho who have had extensive    discussions with us and contributed significantly to the conception of the model    and to our understanding of U.S. agricultural policy; to the OECD Agricultural    Directorate who shared their knowledge of agricultural policies in the OECD    countries and their modeling experience with us. We have also benefited enormously    from data and other information contained in AgLink (which was accessible to    us through the agreement of Minist&eacute;rio da Agricultura and the OECD).    None of those mentioned above are responsible for the errors and omissions that    may still remain.    <br>   <a name="nt02"></a><a href="#tx02">2</a> This paper was prepared in 2002 to    support the the WTO panel against the U.S. domestic support policies for soybeans    that was Brazil was then considering. Due to changes in the world soybeans market,    with significant price increases, the WTO panel was not requested. We submitted    for publication the original version of the paper, without updating the data    and model estimation.    <br>   <a name="nt03"></a><a href="#tx03">3</a> Area increases were also observed in    cotton (358 thousand hectares); sunflower (104 thousand hectares) and rice (98    thousand hectares).    <br>   <a name="nt04"></a><a href="#tx04">4</a> Yield is a partial index of productivity.    A more appropriate indicator is the total factor productivity index, whose calculation    goes beyond the scope of this analysis.    <br>   <a name="nt05"></a><a href="#tx05">5</a> These are based on the three-year averages.    <br>   <a name="nt06"></a><a href="#tx06">6</a> The paper does not contain tables.    The percentage mentioned in the text is based on inspection of Figure 34, page    20.    <br>   <a name="nt07"></a><a href="#tx07">7</a> This is equivalent to 2 to 4 million    acres.    <br>   <a name="nt08"></a><a href="#tx08">8</a> The actual value of the marketing loan    assistance in 2000 was US$ 37/ton (calculations based on Hart and Babcock, 2001,    <a href="#tab02">Table 2</a> and the U.S. production of 75,055 million tons).    ]]></body>

Abstract: It is possible to affirm that in the last two years the word "feminism" has acquired a new weight, conquering a significant space in social networks, the media and in the streets. Audiovisual was one of the areas that accompanied this recent rise of feminism, which materialized through a series of initiatives focused on claiming rights and discussing sexism in the labor market. In this article, we intend to present and reflect on eight initiatives that we consider emblematic of this contemporary intersection between feminism and cinema: Mulher no Cinema, Mulheres do Audiovisual Brasil, Mulheres Negras no Audiovisual Brasileiro, Cabíria Prêmio de Roteiro, Eparrêi Filmes, Academia das Musas, Cineclube Delas and FINCAR - Festival Internacional de Cinema de Realizadoras.

Abstract Environmental education needs to be molded as a structuring public policy, in addition to specific projects and programs in order to gain effectiveness in combating the socio-environmental and civilizational crisis. This demands the unveiling of the concept of public policies, which is the purpose of this study. The concept of multi-center public policies, as a result of government and other social players&#8217; action, is used here. The results in the literature establish the need for three dimensions involved in the cycle of public policies presented by Frey: policy, polity and politics and, in this study, the essentiality of a fourth dimension is considered: that of everyday politics, which is related to instituting social forces and their importance in the construction of public policies intended to be participatory.

The Interamerican Conference of Montevideo, that took place in November 1933, is the starting point of a long and consistent cooperation between Bertha Lutz and Brazilian diplomacy. During the same conference, a radical faction of North American feminism - the National Party of Women - obtained a temporary political victory. Lutz opposed the NWP due to her own convictions and personal bounds to other feminist groups. This essay examines the reasons why diplomatic milieu adhered to the defense of women´s rights. The debate of Montevideo also enhances the understanding of Bertha Lutz´s political thought, as well as opens new historiography perspectives to the question of the political cultures of feminisms.

Academic studies on the issue of the Judiciary and judges&#8217; independence, both normatively and descriptively, are reasonably developed. The current academic production is significant and discusses both the dilemmas and difficulties of there being a branch of the government with high doses of autonomy in democratic regimes. From the democratic point of view, the issue is how barely-accountable actors coexist in a system based fundamentally on citizens&#8217; vote. In relation to this debate, less attention is given to the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the prosecutors. This bibliographic essay analyzes, synthesizes and reinterprets part of the academic production on independence and its tensions in democracy in relation to the Judiciary and also presents a proposal of how to study the same subject in the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office.

ABSTRACT This study aims to analyze the academic production developed in Brazilian graduate programs in education, using the database of the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior [Higher Education Personnel Improvement Coordination] - Capes - and the Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations - BDTD as sources. The qualitative approach employed in this study is based on content analysis. Regarding methodology, we carried out a bibliographical survey of dissertations and theses from two describers: school infrastructure and physical space. Our mapping identified 90 abstracts, as follows: 23 dissertations and 67 theses affiliated with 42 higher education institutions in Brazil. In addition to allowing us to construct the state of the art, the analyzed data point out the emerging need of studies involving school infrastructure and physical space, as empirical objects and not only as marginal issues in academic studies.

This article presents the results of research that analyzes the assessment systems implemented by five brazilian states (Bahia, Ceara, Minas Gerais, Parana and Sao Paulo), considering their characteristics in 2005-2007. Taking into account their specificity, an attempt is made to explore how the results have been used for formulating and implementing educational policies, as well as their potential for becoming a milestone in educational policy that effectively intervenes in the management of schools systems and schools. It was observed that the systems tend to have similar characteristics, their main point of reference being the Basic Education Assessment System, on national level. As for using the results, their impact is at best tenuous, or even non-existent, even though, in the words of their proponents, it is preceded by powerful rhetoric, as expressed in the literature about its potential. However, from an examination of the systems carried out by the managers themselves, it is possible to identify a concern with making them more effective. So, even in this study initiatives have already been identified that seek to transform the use of the data obtained into a management tool, as the ones that propose offering bonuses to teachers and staff.

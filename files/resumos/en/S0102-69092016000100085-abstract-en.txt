The article seeks to discuss the foundations of ethnography in the cyberspace and the theoretical-methodological possibilities opened by the Actor-Network Theory (ANT). In the socio-technical perspective designed by the ANT, ethnography is no longer view as an eminently interpretative activity, but as a description of the series of connections in which actants (&#8220;human&#8221; and &#8220;non-human&#8221;) are inserted in the course or their action. The question of the &#8220;repopulation&#8221; of the elements made visible by the description (in addition to the &#8220;human&#8221;), the dilemmas of the writing on action and agency, understood as what or who &#8220;make it happen&#8221;, besides the requirements established by the description of networks through the traces left by the actants, all that demand a revision of the ethnographic activity which is subjected to a debate in the article. Accordingly, the notions of producing symmetry and of a description with focus over the action are especially discussed, seeking to systematize the foundations of an ethnography of action.

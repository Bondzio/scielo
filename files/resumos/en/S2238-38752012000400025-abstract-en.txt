Abstract: The author discusses in this article Edward Sapir&#8217;s perspective on culture. He stresses that the fact that Sapir is primarily a linguist plays a central role in order to understand the singularity of such a perspective. The author also stresses the importance of the notion of &#8220;form&#8221; in language as well as in social life. This emphasis on form makes possible a radical criticism of evolutionist, diffusionist, and functionalist concepts of culture. According to the author, the notion of authenticity plays an important role in Sapir&#8217;s concept of culture once for that author culture (authentic cultures) necessarily exists by means of singular individual experiences.

This article focus on the debate of political representation, especial group representation, and the policy of quotas with the purpose of highlighting their main and most contentious arguments, exploring their inconsistencies, problematizing and establishing a dialogue between them. It will be considered to what extent the argument for the inclusion of non-hegemonic group members in the political decision making process, through means such as quotas, may be justified from a normative standpoint. Given the contentious character of the concept of political representation and of the notion of group identity and interest, to what extent could this demand be justified? This discussion will be carried out through a critical analysis on the meaning of political representation, the notion of group rights, interests, identities and perspectives, and the main arguments for and against quotas. The article will be centered on the debate about the political representation of women, establishing thus a close dialogue with and between feminist perspectives.

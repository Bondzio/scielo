The article presents the results of the analysis carried out over the grupal reconstruction of stories read in kindergarten classrooms. 30 story reading situations were analized qualitatively through the Comparative Constant Method, considering the reconstruction of the story after the reading. The results of the analysis allowed to identify different types of reconstructions of the stories through the interaction according to the quantity and quality of teacher and pupils' participation and the quantity and quality of the information recovered from the text: incomplete reconstructions, descriptive reconstructions, question-answer reconstructions, debate-reconstructions, monopolized reconstructions and complete shared reconstructions. Each one of these types described according to the cognitive operations demanded from its participants, shows different ways of scaffolding oral narrative production.

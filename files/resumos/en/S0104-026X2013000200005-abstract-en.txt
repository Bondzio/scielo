Two thousand years of the civilization process have led to a split-up in the female body: saints and whores. It does not seem new, however, to think that this parity responds more to a male need than to the ways women present themselves. Dialoging with a bibliography that discusses suppressed images of "active", erotic and sacred females, this paper aims to reflect on the possible predominance of pombagira cults, an Umbanda spiritual entity. Distant from the sweet and passive, the pombagira emanates power, intelligence and sex, but paradoxically makes herself present in the sacred space and stands out in believers' worship. In this sense, attempts are made to discuss how the cult seems to perform something archaic, resistant to suppression and standardization.

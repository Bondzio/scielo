The WSF emphasises on critic to the neoliberal model and on the construction of alternatives. From both propositions, it is a space with which feminism identifies and to which it contributes with independent experiences and thoughts. At the same time it is vitalized with the challenges to put in a global perspective its thematic,sectoral, local processes, and to expand and recuperate the transforming 'gender' potential. They are challenges that express themselves, among others, in the forms of interacting in the world scene and in the treatment of issues like the economy and diversities.

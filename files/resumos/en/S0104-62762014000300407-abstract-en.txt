This article brings a contribution to the comprehension of the path of recognizing the rights of children and adolescents in Brazil, in which there have been seen symbolic representations that often are created, modified or popularized by the media. Newspapers with the largest circulation in the state of SÃ£o Paulo in a period after almost 20 year of the Statute of the Child and Adolescent (ECA) coming into force were investigated with framing analysis. Results suggest that the ECA faces obstacles to its consolidation, in the form of superficial and fragmented media coverage of events that should be contextualized in relation to public policies and their specific understanding of causes and possible solutions applicable.

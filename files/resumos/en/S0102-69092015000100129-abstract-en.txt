The centrality of the media in the Brazilian society assigns to the means of communication an important role in contemporary social dynamics, whose influence attains several fields of human activity, including the political. The debate on public policies has been dominating most of the agenda of the social sciences. In general, the approaches preserve a tendency of institutional character, with the analyses centered on decisional or evaluative processes. The article observes, however, a gap in the researches developed on the theme, i.e., the lack of an assessment of the media&#8217;s participation on the cycle of the public policies. In this sense, the article seeks to infer the relations between media coverage and public policies processes in contemporary Brazilian society.

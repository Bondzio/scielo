Abstract This article proposes a method to measure the capacity of policy conferences to influence the making of policies, by incorporating the proposal approved in the participatory forums. Once the approved proposals are both suggestions of the organizing department and new guidelines emerged from the conference process, this article assesses the degree of incorporation of both kinds of proposals separately and names the real influence of the policy conferences as the proportion of new proposals incorporated over the total. This analysis is employed for the 1st Conference of Aquaculture and Fisheries, Urban Policies, Environment, Sports, Women's Policies and Policies to Promote Racial Equality and shows the conferences have served as informational forums of new policies.

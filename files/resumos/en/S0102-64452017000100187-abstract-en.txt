Abstract The changes in social security policies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile are examined in this article through the lenses of a double process. One is the insertion of these countries in the global economy, which imposes the adjustment of their economic and social structures to the new era of globalization, following neoliberal hegemony. The other process is the dynamics of political domestic factors that are viewed as filters through which the adjustments required by globalization are processed in each country, resulting in different levels of intensity of pension reforms (more or less radicals) or in policies that express different levels of resistance to financial capital pressures.

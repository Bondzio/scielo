The analysis of the environmental quality and of the associations kept with the economical system has always been of great concern amongst the scientific community and the public and private organizations. The state of Rio Grande do Sul has been presenting a high Index of Human Development (IDH in Portuguese), although, low values of important environmental quality indicators. Thus, the present study had the purpose of providing empirical evidences on how the level of economical activity affect the environmental quality of the municipal districts of Rio Grande do Sul as well as to build a Index of Environmental Quality (IQA) and a index of Human-Environmental Development (IDH-A) for this state as an alternative to represent its level of human development with a environmental dimension. Results revealed that more intense levels of economical activity unleash minor environmental quality. The state medium IQA has been estimated in 0,55 and the IDH-A in 0,25, being quite below the medium IDH of Rio Grande do Sul, which was 0,78. It was still evidenced by the Exploratory Analysis of Space Data (Aede) the existence of distinct space patterns in relation to the per capita income, to the IQA, to the IDH and IDH-A of Rio Grande do Sul, indicating its great space heterogeneity.

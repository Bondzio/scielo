Abstract Carabineros is one of the best evaluated police institutions in Latin America. One of its features is positive citizen assessment with the highest level of trust. However, this element has also limited political intervention on institutional processes and inhibited reforms emanating from social and political actors in areas that need to be reviewed. The article describes the Chilean process marked by low and stable levels of crime, growing fear, concern over high crime and negative evaluation of criminal justice actors. Paradoxically, the police institution seems not to be affected by the panorama of annoyance and public concern. On the contrary, it is rated positively. The text also argues that trust should be analyzed in greater detail and focused on those groups that show more distrust and dissatisfaction in police work: the poor, young people and those who have had contact with police officers.

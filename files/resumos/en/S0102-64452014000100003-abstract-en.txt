The article examines the reasons that motivated Maria Isaura Pereira de Queiroz to become involved with the memory project aimed at the preservation and publication of the complete works of her master and friend Roger Bastide, professor at the University of SÃ£o Paulo from 1938 to 1954, who died in 1974. Maria Isaura's letters to Bastide's widow and daughter written from 1975 to 1989 reveal the efforts undertaken by her as well as the difficulties she faced carrying out a project that remained unfinished.

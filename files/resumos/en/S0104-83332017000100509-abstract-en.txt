Abstract The article discusses, in a gender perspective, the reverberations of religious moral and scientific knowledge in the construction of representations of body and female sexuality in Brazil. The most important question that arises is how the religious and scientific community established the regime of truth and model of reason gave meaning to female sexualized bodies in the course of historical development? The answer to the question was obtained from the analysis and display of a multidisciplinary theoretical framework that highlights the contributions of history, psychology, sociology and philosophy.

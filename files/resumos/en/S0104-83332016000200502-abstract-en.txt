Abstract U.S. feminist scholarship during the 1990s, concerned with the changing nature of the nation-state in relation to global processes addressed not solely economic structures, but also transnational frameworks that attended to the encounters that bring people into intimate contact. These cross-border accounts refused to see globalization as a new formation, but rather argued that it continued and exacerbated colonial inequalities, offering new and recycled vistas for understanding sexuality, love and intimacy. The nation-state, however, has not waned, but merely shifted its role to support capital restructuring and profit motives across borders, while monitoring more severely how bodies move across borders.

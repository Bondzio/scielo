Around 1910, the first papers in natural sciences signed by women were published in the Argentinean scientific review, the women took the doctoral's degrees in these disciplines and several were hired as assistants in laboratories, museums and public distributions. In this article, we analyse the context of emergency of this first generation of women who participated formally in the Argentinean scientific-academic setting. Firstly, we examine the feminine access to the university and the scientific studies; and then, the institutional jobs, scholarships and works of some of the first graduated women in natural sciences.

This article discusses the present situation of water stress in the Macrometropolitan Region of São Paulo focused in a context that affects a system of dams responsible for the supply of nine million inhabitants in Greater São Paulo within a theoretical approach of water governance. The analytical focus is centered in the need of revision of the present policy of water governance. There is a need to confront the insustainable use of water, as climatic changes demand a new dynamic of risk management and the need to promote transparency and accountability in public management. The social, economic, institutional and environmental consequences that water stress generates for the State of São Paulo indicates the need of profound changes in water governance in this complex scenario. This article proposes to show that the lack of an efficient and equitable model of governance demands new responses that integrate the different actors involved through a new water action network.

Abstract In this interview, the Cuban anthropologist Pablo Rodr√≠guez Ruiz discusses various dimensions of the racial question in the Cuban context: race as a social construct; the social representations surrounding this notion; and the historical existence of an ideology of racism in Cuba - one of the expressions of which is what he labels 'racism of the however.' The interview also explores past and current forms of prejudice, discrimination and racial inequalities in Cuban society; and the conquests, fragilities and challenges of public policies aimed at resolving racial issues.

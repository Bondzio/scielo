Abstract Based on his experience working with health education, the author discusses the new health demands that require critical and reflective professionals, able to work in a collaborative and interdisciplinary team. In the paradigmatic rupture context of vocational training, in which the teaching - learning process is assumed as a social construction, the focus is on the role of the student, and the former is structured by the collaborative process of assumptions, interactional and collective. This demands a revision of teachers' roles in view of the new educational functions. These demands include the use of computer technology in virtual teaching - learning environments. Finally, these innovations and demands are considered as potential interfaces regarding training policies of health professionals.

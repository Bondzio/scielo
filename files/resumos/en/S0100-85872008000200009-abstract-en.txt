The aim of this paper is to study the construction's logic of collective identities within neo-pentecostals evangelic groups. In order to do this the author analyze the synthesis between religion, psychoanalysis and self-help therapy expressed in the discourse of "Inner Health" developed by an evangelic Church located in the center of a high income neighborhood in Buenos Aires city, Argentina. The Ernesto LaclauÂ´s theory of hegemony allows him to analyze the function of floating signifiers in the religious task of creating a wide identity that assimilates elements of different symbolic universes when interpelling the subject through the theology of health.

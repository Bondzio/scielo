The paper aims to analyze the generation and use of revenues intended for the Fundo Especial do Meio Ambiente e Desenvolvimento Sustentável, from the certified emission reductions, auctioned in 2007 and 2008, of the Clean Development Mechanism projects established in the Bandeirantes and São João landfills, in the city of São Paulo, considering the stakeholder access to those revenues. The analysis is based on a documental research and interviews, adopting a multi-agent approach, covering agents in the political, economic and social spheres. It was found that the access and preferences posed by the surrounding landfills communities not have been addressed until this moment. Finally, there is an insufficient action to employ the perspective of the local management of the urban solid waste as a guideline for local ownership of the carbon market revenues.

Abstract Trough a brief evaluation of the importance of women anthropologists for our most traditional anthropological scenarios &#8211; the British, the French and the American one &#8211; and reviewing the the contemporary efforts to bring them back to the forefront of the history of our discipline, it is possible to ask what have we been doing with the cultural differences in our analyses of other societies. Knowing what is it that makes women and men anthropologists different and similar in our own tribe maybe help us to know better such differences and similarities in other tribes.

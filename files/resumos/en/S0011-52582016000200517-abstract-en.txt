ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to examine the processes of rationalization of companies and labor in the automotive reparation industry and their repudiation based of practices of resistance carried out by this professional category. Taking into account a study case in the city of Porto Alegre (Brazil), based on interviews, ethnographies and documental research, the article analyzes the impacts of the productive restructuring of the auto-manufacturing complex on the auto-servicing sector, starting in the 1990s. It was possible to observe the emergence of the principles of entrepreneurship and the competence model in the field of auto repair shops, as well as the forms according to which these precepts are contested through the concrete experience of subjects.

"Non-places", a term first used by Marc Augé in 1992 in his book Non-Lieux, runs through his work as the embodiment of something fundamental to understanding contemporary society. In this article we try to clarify the meaning, or multiple meanings, attributed by the author to this term, examining among other things the discussion on the shopping centre as a "non-place" and looking for similarities and differences between "non-places" and the "space of flows" (Castells). The question that always seems to underpin Marc Augé's thought is whether and how non-places"' can cause us to lose ourselves as a group, a society, such that isolated 'lone' individuals come to prevail.

The present article aims to reflect on aspects regarding the reception to sociologist Gilberto Freyre&#8217;s work in France after the Second World War, when the book The masters and the slaves was translated and figured in reviews of eminent French intellectuals. The aim was to observe how a work about Brazil, written in the beginning of the 1930s, published and reinterpreted twenty years after, interacted with political discussions on race and colonialism between the end of the Second World War and the Algerian War.

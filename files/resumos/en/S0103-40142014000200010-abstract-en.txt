This article addresses the job market in the Industrial Zone of Manaus (PIM), observing the economic nature of the social division of labor, since the beginning of the Free Trade Zone of Manaus (ZFM). Social division of labor, a basic precept of economic prosperity, is an essential part of the study of (under)development of a region or country. In this case specifically we discuss the social division of labor through classics on the theme and with a local data base we make observations on jobs in the PIM. In our results we mention that besides the jobs generated we need to verify in what part of the global value chains determined occupations are necessary or not. Based on these considerations we propose that to qualify the job supply in PIM, it is necessary to take into consideration the quality of the jobs and not only the quantity, which tend to offer low average salaries. Thus, it is necessary to have a strategy to promote the qualification of the local work force, as well as attract and maintain companies that offer better jobs with higher average salaries.

Abstract: The study aimed to assess the impact of incentive policies for the production of milk and dairy products in the Brazilian regions from the simulation of two policies: the first consisted of increases of 10% and 20% in subsidies for the production of milk and dairy products (1A and 1B scenarios), and the second, a reduction of 10% to 20% in taxes on the use of primary factors in the production milk and dairy products (scenarios 2A and 2B). Both simulations were performed based on the o General Equilibrium Analysis Project of the Brazilian Economy (Paeg). The results indicated that the Brazilian regions with higher milk production, respectively Southeast, South and Central-West would be the most benefited, as well as displace the production factors such as capital and labor, from the North and Northeastern regions, whose dairy sector would present losses. These results were shown in greater magnitude when simulated the policy of expansion of subsidies compared to the tax relief policy. From this, the implementation of differentiated regional and sectorial policies is the alternative indicated.

Abstract From museum souvenirs to the focus of re-readings, the universe of art history has been used for different extra-artistic purposes. Constantly, filmmakers, designers and, in particular, professionals in the area of communication refer to it, taking fragments and allusions from this field to publicity campaigns, posters, visual identities, among others. This process can be frequently seen on the covers of Horizontes Antropol√≥gicos. Based on a reflection about the use of artistic images by the communication area and having as scope five specific issues of the magazine, this article investigates the artworks chosen, emphasizing some aspects such as representation and symbology, social function and trajectory. From a synthetic and thematic dialogue between art and anthropology, proposed by the editors of the magazine, an analytical dialogue emerges and justifies the historical value of this patrimony, taking into account its primordial value: the artistic one. From the artworks outline and approach, the construction by the artists of their own images can be emphasized, showing their role as social transformation agents.

This paper examines some recent trends in the world of labor in Brazil. For instance, until the 1980s, the number of outsourced workers was relatively small, whereas the following decades saw a significant increase in their number, resulting from a powerful restructuring of production processes and from changes in the realm of the socio-technical organization of work. We also intend to outline three sectors that play an important role in Brazilian capitalism: the auto industry, agribusiness, and telemarketing and call centers. We thus hope to indicate some constitutive features of the new morphology of labor in Brazil.

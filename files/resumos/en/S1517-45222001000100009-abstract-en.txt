The aim of this work is to present a characterization and analysis of how poor young women relate themselves to social policies. Our goal is to investigate the meaning they give to the participation in an employment program, by recognizing some specific traits that lead them into it, as well as family income strategies. The presentation is organized in two parts. The first one summarizes the employment program of the Labor and Social Security Ministry, which has the most women benefiting from it: Community Services. The second part examines the plans implemented within the Community Service Program in a specific territory, the Partido de Moreno. Data originate, on the one hand, from Labor Ministry and the Moreno Township's documents and, on the other hand, from interviews with the Program's province officials and young women who took part in those Plans.

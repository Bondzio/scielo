ABSTRACT The current context of public policies has generated tensions and insecurities in face of the prescriptions that reach/affect schools and teachers. If, on the one hand, research points to the need for teachers to take on a leading role, on the other hand, the publication of a document such as Brazil&#8217;s National Curricular Common Core (NCCB) - linked to evaluation system - stifles the teachers&#8217; work. Not to mention the actions that have been adopted to implement the NCCB, in a visible return to neo-technicism. In face with these issues, this paper aims to discuss the context of the teaching of Mathematics in the first years of Elementary School, in a historical retrospective of the curricular policies from the last decades. In this trajectory, we analyze how the NCCB interrupts a process of previously-achieved improvements; the text of the document - approved by the CNE - has several gaps and contradictions between the introductory discourse and the specific abilities required to teach Mathematics, and is reductionist with regard to some kinds of knowledge, disregarding the advances of the research in Mathematical education in Brazil.

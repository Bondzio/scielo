This work compares and discusses the legislations of the countries members of Mercosul in relation to their systematic implementation of the Evaluation of Environmental Impacts. The processes of environmental licensing adopted by Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay are very similar; however Argentina does not have a complete legislation of national reach. The Paraguayan legislation stands out for establishing the notification to the Ministry of the External Relations in cases of environmental damages beyond the country's borders. Among all legislations, the Brazilian, in spite of being the pioneer, is the most complete and modern.

The present paper aims to discuss different questions around the theme that refers to asymmetries and how they are treated in Mercosur, as well as its productive issues. With this aim, we performed a historical analysis from the genesis of the bloc until the renewed spirit that emerged after 2003, considering specially the economic paradigms and the developmental models that have exerted influence in the region.

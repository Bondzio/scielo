This paper analyzes two experiences of risk research to world heritage. One of them was held by Federal Technology Institute of Technology in Peru and the other one by the team of Noah's Ark, University of Bologna. The examination of both tests enables different understandings of heritage, different ways of conceiving the incidence of risk to heritage, as well as some reasons that may explain the difficulty in implementing actions to reduce, prevent or avoid the impact of threats.

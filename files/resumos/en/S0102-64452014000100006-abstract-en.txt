The present work consists in an analytical effort in order to reflect on the normativity terrain in political theory from the political ontology presents in Ernesto Laclau's discourse theory. In this sense, our main purpose is to critically discuss the normative possibilities for the political theory in general from a specific post-foundational political theory. We depart from a discussion, which establishes that Laclau's political thought should be seen from a theoretical point of view and not as political philosophy enterprise. This supposes an analytical applicability based on actual political practices that can be useful (with all limitations as we shall explore in this text) to think about normativity in politics. The next steps toward our main purpose are to explore Laclau's notions of ideology and discourse, antagonism and dislocation. Thereafter exploring these concepts we are able to establish the limits to think normativity in political theory according to the author's theory.

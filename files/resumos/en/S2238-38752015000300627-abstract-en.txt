Abstract In this interview, Stephen Hugh-Jones takes stock of his work, in collaboration with Christine Hugh-Jones, among the Eastern Tukanoan speakers of the Uap√©s basin, and of Amazonian ethnology more generally. In dialogue with some of the main Americanist authors, he stresses that anthropological models of Amerindian peoples need to account for the complex variety of social and cosmological forms found in the continent. He highlights the ethnographic specificities of northwestern Amazonia, which he considers to be a veritable civilization, and reaffirms his conviction that Amazonian anthropology is capable of producing renewed and comparative theoretical syntheses which take into account the sociocultural and historical wealth of the region's people, hence contributing to anthropological thought more generally.

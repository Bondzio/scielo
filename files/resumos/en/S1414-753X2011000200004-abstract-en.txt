This essay deals with the apparent tension between the normative standards and expectations of anti-normativity standards involved in environmental education (EE). We discuss the meanings that are being produced on and from the practice of EA and involve the socialization of an environmental citizenship, imbued with a normative character and, at the same time, an emancipatory ideology. We opted for an interpretative route, where environmental education constitutes itself as one of the new ecological moralities.

ABSTRACT This study aims to analyze the use of curriculum-based monitoring as a school system to identify students at risk in reading, in the context of an educational model based on the degree of response to intervention. A quantitative investigation was conducted with all third grade students (82 students) from a group of schools in the north of Portugal. Data processing was done using descriptive and inferential statistics. Among the conclusions, the following stand out: the existence of ten students at risk in reading throughout the school year and the fact that, at the end of the third year of schooling, the mean results of students who were never at risk was more than double the mean results of students who were at risk for the entire year.

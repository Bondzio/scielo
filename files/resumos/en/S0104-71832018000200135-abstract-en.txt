Abstract In this article, we seek to bring some notes about elements that permeate contemporary neoshamanic networks, such as transit and displacement of people and artifacts, tradition and authenticity, patrimony, shamanic technologies, pilgrimage and religious tourism, interchange and alliances among diverse groups, as well as the establishment of disputes, conflicts and &#8220;market&#8221; relationships, and inter-religious conflicts. In order to do so, we observe as a case study the II World Ayahuasca Conference, which brought together an unprecedented number of people and groups involved in the theme of ayahuasca, such as anthropologists, indigenous peoples and religions. We intend to show that contemporary neoshamanic networks are also constituted through relations of power, conflicting interests and a multiplicity of different views on culture and religion, and that there actually is a Brazilian ayahuasca field and many different &#8220;visions&#8221; regarding ayahuasca, where elements such as prestige, social legitimacy, identity and patrimony are in dispute.

The paper argues that debate related to resolution of current economic crisis emphasizes again the conflict between social-democracy, which defends the Welfare State in its functions of economic intervention and material integration, and neoliberalism or neo-conservatism, which defends the self-referentiality of economy, and so the economic crisis is caused by alien mech-anisms (political and normative) that violate its self-referential logic. With this, the paper defends that beginning of 21st century is the great moment of left programmatic, founded in the affirmation of Welfare State, based in a wide social consensus, and undermining important principles of economic laissez-faire.

Abstract: Poverty, highlighted by inequality, is observed as a tendency to unsustainability. This aspect can be seen also in the social structure which runs relationships between men and women worldwide. Based on academic and empirical experiences on ecofeminism, this article aimed to establish analysis about how women and nature have been represented in the human context of the Reserva Extrativista de Canavieiras, Bahia, Brazil. This paper shows that there is a leaning to unsustainability on extractive and economical activities performed where the reserve is located, as well as on treatment to women which can been classified as attempt of silencing them up. However, at the end, this article also presents how women there have been overcoming their situation with some educational help from the university outreach.

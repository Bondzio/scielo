<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since January 2011, popular uprisings overthrew the   long-time dictators of Tunisia and Egypt. They shook rulers in Libya, Bahrain,   Syria, Yemen, Morocco, and Jordan, marking it the greatest wave of political   unrest the world has seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall. This paper will   try to map the US reaction to the unexpected events of the Arab Spring and how   it put together a policy response. It will start with an introduction   presenting a framework for the understanding of the policy approach of the   Obama administration during the first months of the Arab uprisings. Then, it   will map the evolution of the US policy toward the events in the different Arab   Spring countries, especially Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, Yemen, and Syria. The aim   is to appraise namely whether the regime changes brought about a reassessment   of American foreign policy, shifting from decades of support for autocratic regimes   to backing for pro-democracy movements.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Trying to frame a policy approach</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Obama administration's response to the Arab Spring   has been fairly ambivalent and hesitant. Indeed, the apparent inconsistencies   of US policy vis-&agrave;-vis the Arab Spring (for example, calling for Hosni   Mubarak's departure just days after Cairo's street protests took shape, while   refusing to denounce the Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria despite weeks of   protests and repression), combined with a determination to a forceful regime   change in Libya, only highlighted the contrast between the administration's   determined approach toward some of the Arab Spring regimes and much of the rest   of its Middle East policy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Critics have faulted the US for its seemingly embrace   of the concept of "responsibility to protect" in Libya and calling for Col.   Muammar Gadhafi to step down from power and not defending the same in Syria.   The approach toward Syria contrasts markedly with military intervention in   Libya or the US stance toward the brutal crackdown of pro-democracy protesters   in Bahrain - a tiny, but strategic US ally in the Persian Gulf. The   uprising against the minority dictatorship in Bahrain was largely ignored by   Washington, which fears losing the headquarters of its Fifth Fleet in Manama.   When Saudi tanks crossed the bridge to crush the Shia uprising in Bahrain, in   March 2011, Obama kept silent and reluctantly acquiesced not wanting to   alienate Riyadh.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The administration was also criticized for being too   cautious in offering support to protesters in Cairo in the first weeks of the   revolt. Eventually, the administration managed to sharpen the message and to   try to place itself "on the right side of history," but at the cost of dumping   a valuable ally. Still, others - especially Republicans, including   presidential candidates - slammed the Obama administration's support for   the Arab Spring for foolishly opening the door to Islamist takeovers of once   secular governments. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After siding reluctantly with the people's revolutions   in Tunisia and Egypt against pro-American regimes, Obama has reportedly   reverted to Washington's old double standard of shielding friendly   authoritarian regimes in the Muslim world. Obama seems to have adopted the same   strategic calculus as previous administrations: where compelling economic,   energy or security interests are at stake, autocrat regimes are allowed not to   be scrutinized by their democracy and human rights record.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The administration's cautious response to the popular   uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa is the reflection of a   realist policy driven by strategic interests, such as oil security, fighting   terrorism, Iran's rise in the region and, equally important, its realization of   the limits of American power and its capacity to shape events. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Obama administration eventually concluded that it   must shape its response country by country, recognizing a stark reality that   American national security interests in the Middle East weigh as heavily as   idealistic impulses.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>US interests in the Middle East in a historical   perspective</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dominant concern of American foreign policy in the   post-World War II period was finding effective ways to check Soviet   expansionism. When applied to the Middle East, this meant using all means available   to prevent the Russians from filling the power vacuum being created by gradual   withdrawal of old colonial powers. The interrelated objectives of containing   Soviet attempts to gain the upper hand in the area and preserving access to the   region's strategic facilities and oil resources required the development of   effective doctrines and policies to attain the designated goals, namely the   promotion of peace and stability and the recruitment of regional partners to   assist the United States in containing the Soviet Union. The first orientation   consisted in guaranteeing the territorial status quo and keeping the   established political order in place as much as possible. Other major interests   were to assure the survival and security of Israel and termination of the   Arab-Israeli conflict (Lenczowski 1992).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">American steadfastness reflected a definite conception   of the importance of the Middle East itself to the United States. The   protection of the oil resources in the Middle East, and the respective lines of   communication, would remain a vital Western interest and would determine the US   strategy and military deployments throughout the subsequent decades (Lesser   1992, 25). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the 1950s, the emerging Arab nationalist movement   became an additional (and most likely) danger to US hold over the oil resources   of the region (Campbell 1969, 257). Local disputes and radical processes of   change were considered to provide appropriate grounds for   communist/Soviet-sponsored activity. US policy was thus guided by the basic   conviction that radicalizing political tendencies of any sort would challenge   Western-favored access to cheap and reliable supplies of oil, the very key to   the economic growth of the industrialized world. US opposition to the   nationalist movement had an early manifestation in Iran, when in 1953 the   Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) executed a plan to overthrow the nationalist   Prime Minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, in order to thwart the nationalization of   the oil sector. Another tangible display of this concern was US policy to   integrate the region in its global system of alliances and to preempt a   possible shift by a regional state away from the American orbit. The US support   to "moderate," pro-Western regimes in the Middle East (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon),   contemplating also the most important oil producers (Gulf kingdoms, Saudi   Arabia, and Iran), was largely successful.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the wake of the Iranian revolution (1979), the   rising political power of Muslim fundamentalism became a new prominent threat.   It was only after the Iranian Revolution with its follow-up of fiery,   revolutionary Islamist-sponsored turmoil, that political Islam's strength was   properly considered. The Iranian revolution and the wave of Shiite radicalism   that marked the 1980s contributed, in another important way, to the shaping in   the West of a stereotyped image of political Islam: that of an anti-democratic,   anti-Western force. With the demise of communism and the end of the Cold War, a   current of thought emerged saying political Islam is the new threat that   confronts the West. Many saw it as aggressively anti-Semitic and anti-Western   and charged Islamist movements of standing in direct competition to Western   civilization and challenging it for global supremacy (Pinto 1999).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Growing American fears about political Islam are   played into the hands of US allies, such as in the case with Egypt, Saudi   Arabia, Turkey, and Pakistan. The `political Islam menace became a convenient   way for a leader to explain away opposition based on a country's economic,   social, and political inequities. It was also an argument in favor of the   continuation of US support to regimes whose strategic value weakened with the   end of the Cold War.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the 1990s, an additional interest was added to the   three core ones: reducing the threats posed by so-called rogue states,   particularly those aiming to acquire weapons of mass destruction. In response   to the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration adopted three major   policies to advance US national security interests in the region: defeating   terrorism, promoting democracy, and stopping the development of weapons of mass   destruction (Pressman 2009).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The Arab Spring and political change in Tunisia and Egypt</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In response to the events of the Arab Spring, the   Obama administration has assumed different policy approaches. They are situated   along a nuanced line that goes from favoring drastic regime change (whether   peacefully or by force), in some cases, and nudging other regimes towards   gradual democratic transformation. These approaches will be briefly outlined in   the following paragraphs.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Egypt and Tunisia, Obama chose to rebalance the   American stance, gradually backing away from support for Mubarak and Zine El   Abidine Ben Ali and allowing the popular movements to run their course. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Tunisia, the act of despair of one fruit vendor   unleashed a wave of revolution through the Arab world. The protests were   sparked by the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi on December 17, 2010, and   led to the ousting of President Ben Ali, 28 days later, on January 14,   2011, putting an end to 23 years of autocratic rule. The popular rebellion   that started there spread to Egypt, Libya, and then on to the Persian Gulf and   the Near East.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the first months of the uprisings, Obama's cautious   response to the popular uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa drew   frequent criticism. It wasn't until May that Obama firmly put the US on the   side of Arab reform during his speech delivered at the State Department.   However, the first clear instance was Tunisia, where Obama immediately clearly   chose to back away from support for Ben Ali.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obama expressed his support for the Tunisian   pro-democracy movement saying: "the United States of America stands with the   people of Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people"   (CBSNews 2011). However, in the following weeks, the administration voiced its   concern for the transition process in that country: "But there's a long way to   go. But, there's no experience. There's no institutional muscle memory about   how you do this" (US State Department 2011). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Egypt, the willingness of the Obama administration   to break with the existing order and embrace its radical transformation was   only too equivocal. The administration tried to perform a high-wire act between   positioning itself "on the right side of history," as one senior diplomat put   it, and not unceremoniously dumping a leader who has supported American policy   on key regional policies (Miller 2011). The balancing act performed by the   Obama administration regarding the approach to adopt towards the Mubarak regime   became excruciating to watch as the former tried to balance conflicting   orientations. As a result, the message often sounded muddled, as if written on   an improvised playbook. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Procrastinating in Egypt</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Egypt's revolution began on January 25, the "Day of   Revolt," when tens of thousands of marchers occupied Cairo's Tahrir Square to   protest against President Mubarak and his government. Probably, not enough   information was available to high-level policymakers at least by late January   2011 to have moved the Obama administration to seriously examine the   possibility of profound instability for the one-man government in Egypt. To be   true, the administration's concern with the evolving revolt was uttered by   Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, during a speech at the Forum for the   Future conference in Doha, on January 13 (Clinton 2011). The secretary of   state's speech actually marked a pronounced contrast with the tone of the Obama   administration so far. In point of fact, President Obama had been criticized by   democracy activists for not more aggressively pushing leaders in the Arab and   Muslim world to pursue political openness. Secretary Clinton warned Arab   governments that they risked "sinking into the sand" if they did not meet the   needs of their people in terms of democratization and development. That   reaction signaled the US frustration with the lack of political change,   undermining efforts to create stable Arab governments that can effectively   combat terrorism.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In any case, the outbreak of the revolution caught   Washington by surprise and constituted a significant intelligence failure. This   event was similar to a certain extent to Washington's unpreparedness towards   the 1979 revolution in Iran. Back then, not only did the administration fail to   prevent the traumatic collapse of Pahlavi rule, which damaged the power and   credibility of the United States in this critical part of the world, and,   perhaps more importantly, undermined the prospects of constructive US-Iranian   relations up to the present time. The belief that the Shah would remain in   power despite the wave of protest was the prevailing view of the Carter   administration and the possibility that he might be forced out of office as a   result of the crisis was dismissed (Pinto 1999, 52). In December 1977, during a   visit to Tehran, and as the police charged the demonstrations against his   visit, Carter had referred to Iran as "an island of stability in a turbulent   corner of the world" (Bill 1998, 233). Later President Carter would express his   "dissatisfaction with the intelligence community failure to warn the   administration of the political crisis in Iran" (Brzezinski 1983, 367). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the early weeks of the crisis, the majority of   Washington's political establishment believed in Mubarak's resilience, as no   one in the bureaucracy wished to be the first to "make the call" that the <i>Rais</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> was on his way out. Similarly as with the Iranian revolution, as a consequence,   each individual and each organizational element procrastinated, waiting for   incontrovertible evidence before pronouncing such a fateful judgment (Sick   1985, 42). In the aftermath of the "Day of Rage," the first crucial day of the   protests in Egypt, Clinton offered a flimsy reaction of the Mubarak's   government hold on power. She gauged it was "stable" and was responding to "the   legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people" (Sanger 2011). Hours   later, riot police attacked the thousands of demonstrators who had gathered in   Tahrir Square. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Drawing a parallel to the Carter administration   failure regarding the Iranian revolution, Gary Sick explains that Washington's   inactivity and inability to draw the proper conclusions from revolutionary   events has to do with "the paralysis of bureaucratic structures in high-risk   situations" (Sick 1985, 42). He argues that if the revolutionary events had   taken place in an area of the world with less strategic importance, there would   have been "little reluctance to speculate about a range of possible outcomes,   including revolutionary overthrow of the existing power structure" (Sick 1985,   42). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the "Day of Rage" on, the administration   frantically tried to catch up with events, and at last begun to adjust its policy   to the fast changing events. On January 26, Hillary Clinton urged all parties   "to exercise restraint" (Clinton 2011), while also appealing to the Egyptian   authorities to allow peaceful protests and the use of the social media. By the   end of January, Obama sent former US Ambassador to Egypt, Frank Wisner, to   convince Mubarak not to seek another term and to help Egyptian officials plan   elections for autumn. On February 1, in a televised address, Mubarak defied   demonstrators who wanted him to leave immediately, by announcing he would not   seek re-election, but would serve out the rest of his term until September. The   statement forced Obama into a difficult position. The official policy of   support for Mubarak was bent on the assumption that the he was capable of   acting vigorously and decisively and that events would not get out of hand:   that was an expectation that proved to be unfounded and short-lived. Obama's   reaction was that "an orderly transition must be meaningful, it must be   peaceful, and it must begin now<i>"</i> (Dorning and Goldman 2011). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obama's statement entered a new phase with Obama's   carefully nuanced public statements signaling a desire for Mubarak to step   aside. The announcement went a long way to meeting pressures for him to make   clear his support for the protesters and preparing the way for easing Mubarak   out of the way as painlessly as possible while beefing up the position of the   moderate opposition. On behest of the administration, Admiral Michael Mullen,   the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, quietly pressed the newly   designated Egyptian Vice President, Omar Suleiman, to urge Mubarak to step   aside so that he could begin negotiating a transition to a new government with   a coalition of opposition figures, including the Muslim Brotherhood (Miller   2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The White House had clearly decided that the <i>Rais</i>' departure would   enhance the chances   that other figures in the regime, such as Gen. Omar Suleiman, could negotiate a   smooth transition. The administration apparently concluded that stability could   only be restored quickly in Egypt if it entered a smooth transition period. US   officials feared that protests rocking Egypt could change the political   landscape of the entire Arab world and beyond. Possible outcomes could range   all the way from pro-democracy forces taking charge in Cairo to, in a   worst-case scenario, regional war and instability, involving Israel and Iran.   In between, there could be a long period of instability that could breed   economic chaos across the region, prolonging the economic plight in the US and   Europe and concerns about mass migration to Europe (Lizza 2011). Days of   watching the protests spread on the streets of Egyptian cities convinced   administration officials that Mubarak probably would not weather the political   storm and that this was compromising the transition to a new political order   (Miller 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The remaining inherent contradictions of an   Administration trying to simultaneously encourage and contain the forces of   revolution in Egypt broke into the open on February 5, when Wisner called   Mubarak an "old friend" of the United States, and said he "must stay in office   in order to steer those changes through" (News Wires 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Part of the confusion also stemmed from the   government's own conflicting message and to the fact that the State Department   diverged from the White House line. Contrary to the Iranian revolution, when   the State Department had enough information "to seriously examine the   possibility of profound instability for the one-man government in Iran," (David   1993, 64-65), this time around it raised doubts as to the wisdom of Mubarak's   ouster. The Obama administration's awkward reaction reflects all too clearly   the dilemma it faced between balancing its support for the democracy   protesters' aspirations with its desire for an orderly political transition in   a strategic ally. The mixed message reflected a policy seemingly wrong-footed   by the speed with which the revolt mounted, and that, inevitably, was made up   on the fly (Sanger 2011). Obama wanted to position the US on the side of the   protesters. Simultaneously, he feared that the uprising could spin out of   control and unsettle the region. He was also hard pressed to assure other   autocratic allies that the US did not hastily abandon its friends. The Saudis   and other "moderate" pro-US Arab states were dismayed at the manner in which   the Americans had responded to a faithful ally. The US decision to forgo   Mubarak shook the Saudi trust on the American hegemony. They undoubtedly do not   harbor illusions about the reliability of American support under the Obama   administration (Teitelbaum 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The strategic calculations behind the flip-flops of   the administration are obvious: Egypt is a lynchpin of the American security   architecture for the greater Middle East. As the world's largest Arab nation,   Egypt is critically important to US foreign policy and to major goals the Obama   administration pursues in the Middle East: the Israeli-Palestinian peace   process, containment of Iran's influence and nuclear ambitions, and counter-terrorism.   Egypt's role is at the heart of normalizing Arab relations with Israel. Mubarak   has also helped guarantee Israel's interests and the stability of its border   with Gaza. After Washington's rapprochement with Egypt, under Anwar Sadat,   every US administration has invested heavily to maintain the status quo. Fear   that Egypt's uprising would develop into an Islamist revolution along the lines   of that of Iran in 1979 would constitute the worst possible scenario for   Washington and Tel Aviv. American policymakers were initially tied by the fear   that Egypt's move toward democracy might be hijacked by the Muslim Brotherhood   or another group unfriendly to American interests. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But now that a generalized political upheaval swept   throughout the Arab world, sticking to a status quo orientation would have been   unrealistic and, political expediency-wise, negative. Eventually, the   administration managed to sharpen the message and to try to place itself on the   right side of history. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Libya: "realigning American interests and values"</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the revolution caught up Libya, on February 15,   Obama initially resisted intervening militarily until he felt he had no choice.   He preferred at first to use diplomatic means and economic sanctions to signal   that Gadhafi's use of force would not help keep him in power. In the first days   of the revolts, a popular criticism of the Obama administration was that its   response to the Libyan crisis was sluggish, the government perceived as idling   while Col. Gadhafi threatened and committed violence against his own people   (Goodenough 2011). Gadhafi ignored both his own pledge of a ceasefire and the   West's warning of military intervention to launch a combined air and land   assault on the rebel self-declared capital of "Free Libya," Benghazi. The rebel-held   city had been clinging to the hope that the Security Council-backed resolution   authorizing a no-fly zone would halt his advance eastward. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The decision to intervene militarily came when   Gadhafi's forces were closing in on Benghazi. On March 17, the Security Council   approved resolution 1973 demanding an immediate ceasefire in Libya, including   an end to the attacks against civilians, and imposing a no-fly zone - and   tightened sanctions on the Gadhafi regime. Military intervention in Libya began   on March 19, as Obama, who was on an official visit to Brazil, announced the   beginning of the strikes, arguing:     "We cannot stand idly by when a tyrant tells his people there will be no mercy"   (Fox News 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rationale for the military intervention was provided   by his statement to the press: "This is the greatest opportunity to realign our   interests and our values" (Hamid 2011). The president was referring to the   broader change going on in the Middle East and the need to rebalance US foreign   policy in order to accommodate a greater focus on democracy and human rights.   He felt that, had the international community not acted when it did, thousands   of Libyans would have been slaughtered as the world watched idly. As Marc Lynch   noted, not acting would have been a powerful message, which would have haunted   America's standing in the region (Lynch 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other factors concurred to make the intervention   possible. Obama emphasized that his decision on Libya was based on what has   become his foreign-policy doctrine: relying on international consensus and   multilateral action to bring about military intervention with a limited   American role (Cooper 2011). In a short timeframe, Obama and Clinton managed to   accomplish the following policy acts: a resolution of support for the intervention   from the UN Security Council; a statement from the African Union supporting   democracy in Libya; and turning over the leadership of the coalition air   campaign to the NATO command in Europe so as to share the costs and dangers of   the operation with allies (Davis 2011). Equally important, the administration   garnered the support from the Arab League for a no-fly zone. Among Arabs, the   decision enjoyed a broad consensus, among both leaders and the street.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Other flashpoints: Bahrain, Yemen and Syria</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The upheaval in Bahrain, which hosts a major US   military base and borders the world's primary oil producer, Saudi Arabia, is   mostly rooted in discontent among the majority Shia Muslim community towards   the Sunni monarchy, although instigators are also among pro-government Sunnis,   and conservative factions of the ruling family (especially the Royal Court and   Defense Ministers). The country is strategically located across the Persian   Gulf from Iran and hosts the US Navy's Fifth Fleet. Moreover, Manama is a critical   link to the decades-old US effort to protect the Western world's access to Gulf   oil. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Bahrain, where the uprisings turned violent, Obama   did not even utter a word in support of armed intervention, instead pressing   the regime to embrace reform on its own. Washington has moderated its regime   reform pressures in Bahrain also for fears of Iranian meddling in that vital   Gulf country and fear that protracted political turmoil could provide an   opening for additional influence by Tehran in Bahrain's neighbor, Saudi Arabia.   The intensified wrangling across the Persian Gulf between the Sunni and Shia   powers has reinforced Washington's wariness about Iran's regional ambitions,   strained relations between the US and important Arab allies, and tempered the former's   initial support for the democracy movements in the Arab world. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">US officials are wary Bahraini Shia are susceptible to   outside influences, such as attempted subversion from neighboring Iran (Hodge   2011). At the invitation of the Bahraini royal family, Saudi Arabia sent troops   into Bahrain to quell the protests, a move that drove a wedge between Riyadh   and Washington (Hodge 2011). Saudi Arabia fears that, if the protesters   prevail, Iran - Saudi Arabia's regional rival - could expand its influence   and inspire unrest elsewhere. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the Obama administration became ever more   outspoken against repression in Syria and Yemen - not to mention Libya,   where Obama eventually put in practice a policy of regime change -, it   remained remarkably restrained about the escalating crackdown in Bahrain. The   strongest criticism came from Secretary of State Clinton in mid-April at the   US-Islamic World Forum when she appealed for a "political process that advances   the rights and aspirations of all the citizens of Bahrain" and asserted that   "security alone cannot resolve the challenges" facing the government. She also   said the administration had raised its concerns publicly and directly with   Bahraini officials (Clinton 2011).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Apparently, the administration threw its weight behind   attempts of Bahrain's royal family to survive, although protesters say their   demands have not been met (Reuters 2012). It believes Bahrain is "an important   force for political stability and economic progress in the Middle East." That   is why the Defense Department announced it intends to sell   US$ 53 million worth of military equipment and support to the Gulf   state, including armored vehicles (DSCA 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In Syria and Yemen, the Obama administration took a   cautious, incremental approach refraining initially from calling for a regime   change. In the case of Damascus, the administration vainly held out hope for a   "managed transition" before coming out and declaring Assad's rule illegitimate.   Initially, Washington was skeptical that the uprising would overthrow the   regime. It also believed it lacked the leverage to affect the situation in the   country. There were other strategic calculi, as well, affecting the   administration's appraisal: for one, Syria is critical to Obama's attempt to   end Iran's nuclear program and to promote Arab-Israeli peace. Ever since it   took office, Obama had been trying to engage Syria - Tehran's greatest   ally in the region - to persuade Iran's leaders to end its nuclear   programme and its support of anti-Israeli terrorism, if not even end its   alliance with the Ayatollah's regime (Landis 2009). Finally, there was little   support in the US for another military adventure in the Middle East. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for Yemen, President Ali Abdullah Saleh's ouster   posed questions about stability in a nation seen by the Obama administration as   a key ally in its fight against al-Qaeda militants. As with the uprisings in   Egypt and Syria, Obama initially failed to side with pro-democracy forces,   wishfully choosing instead to hope for reformers among the very forces of the   regime. Only much later did the tone change in regard to Yemen. The Obama   administration withdrew its support two months into the uprising, after   concluding that Saleh's government could not survive the revolts, and that US   interests were better served by getting a new government in place that might   pursue the fight against al-Qaeda. That issue became more urgent as al-Qaeda   has been able to exploit the turmoil that has resulted from Saleh's lengthy   demise, taking control of the country's lawless southern region. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Initially, the administration limited White House   critiques of the regime, even after that government opened fire on   demonstrators for months in a row. Tens of thousands of protesters took to the   streets of the Yemeni capital in late January 2011 to demand the end of the   three-decade rule of President Saleh. His departure would likely undermine, at   least temporarily, US counterterrorism efforts. He was an important ally in the   fight against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen-based group   responsible for sending two parcel bombs to US synagogues in October 2010 and   the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day 2009 (CNN   2010). Because of Saleh's cooperation, the Obama administration had been   reluctant to be too critical in its comments, at least officially, or to   consider publicly scenarios for his ouster. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yemen's fragile stability increasingly became a   concern to the United States as pro-democracy protests exploded into violence   in mid-March. The violence, which drew condemnation from Obama and Secretary of   State Clinton, may well have been the tipping point. In May, Hillary Clinton   accused Saleh of turning his back on his commitments after he rejected a deal   to step down (Aljazeera 2011). Clinton urged him to sign the US-backed   agreement in order to prevent further chaos (Aljazeera 2011). The agreement was   brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) under which he would hand over   power within 30 days in exchange for a promise of immunity from   prosecution. Despite strong Western pressure, Saleh repeatedly refused to sign   the plan.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Amid rising violence, the US urged Saleh not to return   home from Saudi Arabia (The Telegraph 2011) where he recovered from injuries   suffered in an assassination attempt during a popular uprising in early June   (ZeeNews.com 2011). Yemen fell deeper into turmoil, since the withdrawal of security   forces from some provinces left a power vacuum that al-Qaeda tried to fill.   Islamic militants took advantage of the chaos to seize control of several   cities and towns in a southern province. On jihadist websites, the region   started being referred to as the "Islamic Emirate of Abyan." That has raised   American fears that the militants may establish a firmer foothold in that   Arabian Peninsula country, which is close to the Saudi oil fields and overlooks   key oil shipping routes (Al Bawaba News 2011). On October 21, the US   co-sponsored UNSC Resolution 2014 calling for end to violence, acceptance of   the Gulf Cooperation Council peace plan, and the orderly transfer of power (The   White House 2011). The United States said the transfer of power in Yemen must begin   "immediately" (Reuters 2010). In November 2011, Saleh signed the GCC agreement,   paving the way for his vice-president to become acting president until new   elections are held.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Obama Administration was also slow to condemn   Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's violent repression of peaceful   demonstrators, muting its criticism of Assad's repression. Strangely enough,   only by mid-August did Obama call on Assad to resign due to the deadly   crackdown on peaceful protesters. Public demonstrations across Syria began on   January 26, 2011, but escalated in March. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The administration's caution with Syria is certainly   due in part to the uncertainty that what follows Assad's demise might be worst.   There are constraints on the US will to intervene. Assad's alliances with Iran,   Hezbollah, and Hamas certainly undermine important US strategic interests in   the zone, but, on the other hand, he has kept the border with Israel quiet.   Another factor is the absence of the strong regional support that crystallized   around Libya. Finally, there is little support in the United States for another   military adventure in the Middle East. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US slapped sanctions on Syria at the very   beginning of its crackdown (The White House 2011b). Pressure to place Assad   under sanctions had been building for weeks as his government continued a   brutal crackdown on protesters. Until then, Obama had adopted a much more   measured and cautious approach in the hope that the Syrian president would   respond to international pressure. However, this approach did not work. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">President Obama imposed sanctions again on May 18   against Assad himself and six top aides in order to "increase pressure on the   government of Syria to end its use of violence and begin transitioning to a   democratic system that ensures the universal rights of the Syrian people"   (Carmichael 2011). In imposing the sanctions, the Obama administration stopped   short of saying Assad had lost his legitimacy to rule, but demanded a stop to   the regime's policies of repression and initiating a political transition.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Publicly calling on Assad to resign momentarily   released pressure from an administration that had ruled out more risky policy   options, like those pursued in Libya. For one thing, the US wanted to make sure   it was acting in coordination with allies: an internationally coordinated   pressure, by many capitals at once would have far more effect than one   emanating from a single nation, even if that nation is the United States (Grier   2011). Obama's call for Bashar al-Assad to   "step down" (Phillips 2011) was a long time coming. The president, who had   spoken in public on Syria only twice, had declined to say that Assad should   leave office. The Obama administration's cautious stance on the Syrian   revolution put the credibility of the United States on the line, especially   when it became clear, five months into the start of the uprising, that Assad's   opportunity to institute real reform was not real. The other reason for   dragging its feet was that Obama and Clinton had been relying on their   counterparts in Turkey for advice and mediation with the Syrian regime. They   expected Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo&#287;an's   personal relationship with Assad might help in convincing him to pursue a   reform program (Badran 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obama's willingness to consider all options, and,   especially, to cling to a "lead from behind" policy (Lizza 2011a) did not   enhance American leadership (WP 2011). Eventually, the Turkish leverage over   Damascus bore no fruit. In May, Turkey called on Assad to enact reforms and   rein in the violent crackdown on the anti-regime protests. Assad reiterated a   commitment to start a national dialogue to review new legislation, including   laws on parliamentary elections, the media, and allowing political parties   other than the Baath Party, as well as possible changes to the constitution   (Solomon 2011). However, he has not delivered on his promises and has not   implemented the reforms. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After months of stepping gingerly around urgings that   Assad declaredly renounce the rule, Obama demanded that Assad step down (Lee   2011). The president's ultimatum marked a significant ratcheting up of   pressure. He was accompanied by the European Union (EU) and the leaders of   Britain, France and Germany also calling on Assad to leave (Lee 2011). It was a   dramatic sharpening of international rhetoric since Obama, as well as other   major states, had urged Assad to reform rather than resign (Oweis 2011).   Relying on sanctions rather than military force, Obama has stacked a variety of   sanctions against the Syrian government.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Obama's "reset" speech: a new approach or same old thing?</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speaking at the US-Islamic World Forum in March,   Hillary Clinton provided some insights to clarify the US approach, stating it   strongly supports democratization in the region, although rejecting a "one-size   fits all approach" (Clinton 2011) to the Arab uprisings. Clinton said the   administration had reoriented US policy in the Middle East to focus more on   people and less on governments, but qualified that the response to the   democracy movements would vary from country to country. Indeed, US policy looks   different in Bahrain and Syria than it does in Libya, because American   interests are very different in each arena (Clinton 2011).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Obama administration seemed to realize the need to   build a coherent policy framework towards the upheavals that dealt   comprehensively with the challenges posed by this rising revolutionary wave in   an area where the United States has vital interests. Obama's most comprehensive   response came on May 19 in a speech at the State Department. According to   analyst Friedman, Obama's speech clearly intended to be the formulation of a   Middle East policy, a blueprint for policymaking, rather than just a showcase   for speech-making, "reflecting a shift in strategy if not the declaration of a new   doctrine" (Friedman 2011). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In that speech, he put the US as squarely standing   behind the struggle for freedom and democracy, specifying that Washington   supports them for all Arab peoples, not only for some (The White House 2011).   Obama based US policy on core principles: opposing violence, universal rights,   and the right of people to choose their own leaders. He asserted: "we can, and   we will, speak out for a set of core principles - principles that have   guided our response to the events over the past six months." However, he also   reckoned the uncertainties the US faces in the process: "there will be times   when our short-term interests don't align perfectly with our long-term vision   for the region" (The White House 2011d).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this context, the content and substance of Obama's   speech were important, for two main reasons. First, he characterized the Arab   revolts as a fight for "self-determination." This was a particularly   significant acknowledgement of the Arab peoples' right to ultimately determine   their outcome, as well as an advance on previous vacillating American responses   to the uprisings. Secondly, he also made it clear that the right to live in   freedom and democracy is a universal right that should be enjoyed by   Bahrainis - who are strategically important to the US -, as well as   by Libyans and Syrians - who are not. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obama said the US has a historic opportunity to   embrace this change and the responsibility to support the rights of people   demanding for freedoms, and he announced for "a new chapter in American   diplomacy." He also disclosed mainly a set of economic incentives aimed at   steering the region towards lasting democratic change.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a general sense, the speech did not really resolve   the tension at the heart of the question: that between Obama's rhetoric of   support for reform and the US clinging to Arab governments that are skirting   reforms. Obama's speech left many observers and people in the region   disappointed. He was attempting to square a difficult circle: he wanted to   reaffirm America's support for democratic aspirations, but at the same time did   not want to worsen a rift with allies, such as Saudi Arabia, about the pace of   democratic development. Obama also said little about political grievances in   Saudi Arabia, a major oil supplier, where Shia protesters have been violently   dispersed. Human rights groups have called the Obama administration's approach   to the so-called "Arab spring" inconsistent, charging that US policy toward   some countries has a double standard (Human Rights First 2011). The speech   tried to combine policy interests which are not easily reconcilable and might   even produce different outcomes, at times inimical to American interests: the   fact that "America's interests are not hostile to people's hopes; they're   essential to them &#91;&hellip;&#93; and &#91;that&#93; we will keep our commitments to friends and   partners" (The White House 2011d). Obama also acknowledged that these interests   will mean that sometimes the US may not always take the most aggressive stand   in favor of democracy and freedom: "There will be times when our short-term   interests don't align perfectly with our long-term visions for the region, but   we can and we will speak out for a set of long-term principles," the president   said. The speech represented an escalation of rhetoric, but failed to   adequately shift policy or even render it more coherent.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">US policy towards the Arab Spring has been a divided   policy marked by sincere but reactive support for democratic advances when it   occurred, but no real proactive support for   democracy where dictatorship remains (Carothers 2012a, 37).     Where political change has occurred, the US has usually backed   democratic change, sometimes actively, as in Libya; sometimes more reluctantly,   as in Egypt. But where autocratic stability continues to reign, the administration   has held fast to the decades-old US policy of support for friendly dictators   who are reliable on matters of security and economics (Carothers 2012b).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It must be pointed out, however, that, in its apparent   inconsistency, the administration has tried to strike the right note of   "cautious optimism and seriousness of purpose" in countries undergoing a   democratic transition (Carothers 2012, 34). First, it has avoided getting   involved in complex internal politics of democratic transitions. The US has   been cautious by avoiding to put itself in the center of internal political   change, for fear of compromising the prestige of democracy advocates, of being   accused of interfering, or ultimately of assuming responsibility for an yet   uncertain process. Secondly, it has accepted the popular will of Arab societies   even if it takes the form of Islamist electoral victories, such as in Tunisia   and Egypt.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Diminished US leverage</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The outcome of the current confused struggle unfolding   in the Arab countries swept by the Arab Spring is of the utmost importance to   American interests. Admittedly, the emergence of Islamist governments would be   the more detrimental scenario to US influence, since they have anti-US   platforms. Even if one assumes that democratic regimes would emerge, there is   no reason to believe they will become close allies of the US. A new regional   order may be emerging, one in which the leverage enjoyed by the US is shrinking   and more autonomy is granted to regional actors. As Aliboni points out, "regional   powers are already protagonists of a regional balance in which the West is   unusually absent" (Aliboni 2011, 9). Some new regimes, notably Egypt, may   become less pro-Western than in the past and might want to reassert its role as   regional leading player. The new regime might combine Islam, democracy and   allegiance to Arabism, making it a more palatable model than that of its Arab   pro-Western neighbors.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The central problem, as Friedman has put it, is that   the widespread unrest of the Arab Spring might not turn out to be popular   revolutions or that the revolutionaries necessarily want to create liberal   democracies (Freedman 2011b). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The events reflect a fading Western influence in   general, especially US influence. With popular uprisings sweeping through the   area, US policymakers are looking at other ways Washington can stay relevant in   the region. The West, not least the Obama administration, has been slow to   realize the limits of their influence. They are reacting to events, not driving   them. The United States is no longer able to systematically influence the   choices made in the Middle East. Aliboni asserts: "the Arab spring is a   transition away from the long alliance between the West and the moderate Arab   states, as well as a transition of these states from being more or less passive   clients of the US and the West to more or less vibrant democracies with an   assertive agenda in the region" (Aliboni 2011, 9). The administration realized   that Washington's ability to steer political change in the region appears largely   reduced. In Yemen and Bahrain, the leaders systematically ignored Obama   administration calls to respect human rights and negotiate with the protesters.   Saudi Arabia has signaled its intent to pursue foreign policy goals that, at   times, might differ from US interests in the region (Gause 2011, 22). Defying   US warnings, Palestinian Authority President, Mahmoud Abbas, decided to pursue   a United Nations vote in September 2011 to recognize a Palestinian state.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is clear that Obama decided not to take a single,   blanket approach in order to avoid that rapidly-moving events drove   administration policies. Events in the Middle East are part of a long-term   transformation, with important risks, including the potential rise of Islamism   in Egypt and potential civil war in Syria. The process will take decades to   play out and will remain a challenge for the US presidents to come. The   administration's answer to the Arab Spring very much reflects the interest in   not being sidelined by the events and of placing itself on the "right side" of   history. In the process, Obama had to juggle the idealistic and realistic   impulses that have marked his foreign policy. Thus, at the beginning, an   initial cautiousness was removed and the administration was driven by the   emotional reaction of the street. It was only later that a policy was   formulated - a policy that tries to conciliate particular US interests in   the region and universal, pointedly American values.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result, the Obama administration's response to   the Arab Spring has been fairly ambivalent, hesitant and disjointed: grudgingly   supporting the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, unenthusiastically backing   limited military action in Libya, projecting a nuanced attitude to the unrest   in Bahrain, and confounding US traditional allies.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indeed, its apparent inconsistencies (for example,   calling for Hosni Mubarak's departure just days after Cairo's protests mounted,   while refusing to denounce the Syria's regime, combined with a determination to   a forceful regime change in Libya), only highlighted the contrast between the   administration's determined approach toward some of the Arab Spring regimes and   much of the rest of its Middle East policy. As for friendly countries which   have weathered the storm, the Obama administration has settled on a strategy to   help keep allies who are willing to reform in power, even if that means the   democratic demands of their newly emboldened citizens might have to lag behind.   The administration's commitment to democracy and human rights is undercut by   its pursuit of countervailing economic and security interests. Growing US   concern about stability in the Persian Gulf and Iran's regional influence has   prompted the administration to largely put aside democracy priorities for the   sake of good relations with strategic allies (Carothers 2012, 44).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obama is not the only president who, as far as the   democracy agenda is concerned, has demonstrated "a split personality"   (Carothers 2007, 96). For decades, Washington has considered the Middle East a   region of vital US interest, in part because it sits atop the world's largest   reserves of oil and natural gas. To maintain its strategic influence in the   region, Washington has often relied on friendly Arab governments that suppressed   the democratic aspirations of their people. Like his predecessors, until the   outbreak of the Arab Spring, Obama focused on building bridges with Arab   leaders and governments. In improving relations with the Muslim world, there is   a gap between US political ideals and the realpolitik of its strategic national   interests.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Obama administration   eventually concluded that it must shape its response country by country,   recognizing a stark reality that American national security interests in the   Middle East weigh as heavily as idealistic impulses.

Abstract: In this paper I will focus on the work of the Palestinian artist Mona Hatoum, who has been an exile and an emigr√© for many years and who strongly reflects this identitarian condition in her artistic practice. My discussion will be anchored in Said&#8217;s concept of the &#8220;contrapuntal&#8221; and his questioning of the borders between public and private space, the emotional and the political, the fading notions of &#8220;home&#8221; and &#8220;homeland&#8221; in the context of migration and exile. Moreover, I will argue that as a woman artist who is socially and politically engaged Hatoum&#8217;s work helps us reflect on the new challenges transnational Feminism faces today as an emancipatory and a resilient critical movement.

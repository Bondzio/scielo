The paper assesses the interpretations and diagnostics of Anthony Giddens and Zygmunt Bauman on the repercussions of social dynamics in modernity advanced on the motivations of individuals for political action. Examines the cautious optimism of Anthony Giddens and the "privatization of utopias" in elaborations of Zygmunt Bauman, and seeks to establish ways of understanding these problems.

In order to review the main trends in brazilian research on basic education we analyse academic production (master's and doctorate thesis) presented at the Education postgrade programs in the period 1981-1988. The studies were selected through four keywords: school, school knowledge, teachers and students. We have developed a specific protocol with 17 questions to collect and organize the data. The relevant findings concern: a) the regularity of the production in the four thematic fields; b) the great incidence of studies about the fundamental school; c) the high concentration of research in the south-southeast regions and the strong preference for experienced tutors; the lack of information about the empirical scope and features of the investigation process.

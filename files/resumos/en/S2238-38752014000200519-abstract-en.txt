Abstract The article aims to distinguish the "elective affinities" between rock and roll and the atmosphere of dispute of the 1960s. It returns to the intense creative activity of popular music in those years and to the enormous impact rock had on a significant portion of youth in order to examine subtler compatibilities of politics with culture, in addition to the "necessary" connections between these two social spheres. In this sense, it highlights some bands and analyzes some songs as well as significant trajectories, such as John Lennon's, in order to discuss the influence of music on the public sphere, which broadened the scope of opinions and actions.

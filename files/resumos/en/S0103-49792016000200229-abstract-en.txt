This article, based researches in the context of two marine extractive reserves in the state of Pará, Mãe Grande do Curuçá and São João da Ponta, deals with the changes that has been occurring in local power related to the creation of protected areas of Brazilian Amazon. It is observed, therefore, a politicization of the local challenges, manifested as the result of the work done in the deliberative council, in which the communities mobilization and the engagement of its leaders make debates, about the development of their territory according to environmental demands, possible. This is a significant dynamic of territorial development that benefits itself from a general environmentalization emerged with the creation of reserves and with the deliberative value of compromise of council directors with a political instance. This situation constitutes an interesting opportunity for the analysis of the relations as practices of local deliberative democracy and as an orientation of development that inspires the engagement of local agents in new institutions, such as the deliberative councils.

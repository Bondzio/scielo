The study of the oral literature that for a long time attracted the love of the folklorists and historians was left aside of the big anthropological questionings. Nowadays, with the emergence of the studies about memory, there appear, during the practice of the re-memorisation, multiform narratives difficult to be manipulated by the researcher, who, most of the time, neglect them. The reflection here proposed aims to rise problems linked to the theoretic-methodological aspects of the analysis of the narrative forms in an anthropological perspective. We believe that the compared analysis of the texts of the oral tradition and the results of the ethnographic research, allow to describe the strengths of the studied culture.

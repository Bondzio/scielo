This paper analyses the perceptions of Alfenas and Fama populations concerning the lake Furnas. Memoirists, newspapers and residents' testimonies are used. It concludes that the trajectory of these perceptions is related to different forms of appropriation and relationship with the lake, going from a negative image to a positive one. The dam was "naturalized" and incorporated in the regional daily life.

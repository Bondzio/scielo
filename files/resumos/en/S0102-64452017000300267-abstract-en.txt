Abstract This article retrieves Antonio Gramsci&#8217;s newspaper articles published between 1915 and 1917 where the theme of the revolution appears. To do so, it reconstructs the Gramscian analysis in historical perspective, retaking the French Revolution as a paradigm and the changes of emphasis in the context of a new revolution under way, now in Russia. It shows the analytical course through which Gramsci modifies his way of thinking the cultural and political problem of the revolution, in particular the reflection on the use of military force for revolutionary purposes. It concludes that Gramsci, in this period, begins the development of an original thought about culture and politics, opening the way to what would later be his elaboration on the concept of hegemony.

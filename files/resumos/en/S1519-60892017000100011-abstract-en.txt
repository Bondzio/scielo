Abstract: The article discusses changes in the pet food market from the framework of Economic Sociology. Empirical data used are from interviews with veterinarians and pet shop owners, all held in Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina State. In the article we discuss the process of globalization and its consequences in the feed market. The movement of mergers and acquisitions of multinational companies in the pet feed industry in the 1990s builds and is constructed by the modulation of the meaning of the dogs within the households. Initially they were useful goods to protect homes while in recent decades they became part of the household, being useless and consuming part of the family budget.

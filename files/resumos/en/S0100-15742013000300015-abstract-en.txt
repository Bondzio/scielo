In this article we propose an exercise in analyzing how researchers represent the literacy process or illiteracy based on a thematic and bibliographical survey of articles published in Cadernos de Pesquisa, edited by the Carlos Chagas Foundation. The analysis covers a period of 40 years from the first issue of the journal, launched in 1971, to issue CP142, in 2011. With this approach we seek to assess the investment of social work based on a certain time period and on classifying principles of literacy and illiteracy as a social phenomenon.

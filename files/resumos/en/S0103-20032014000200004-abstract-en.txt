In this paper, tariff equivalent of NTMs are estimated considering the beef trade (frozen and fresh beef, bone and boneless) between Brazil and the EU, for the period from 2000 to 2010. The literature review points out a considerable number of requirements that affect beef trade. A model is estimated, assuming homogeneity and heterogeneity of goods, and following the methodology proposed by Yue, Beghin and Jensen (2005). In general, high values for the tariff equivalents are observed, i.e., the European domestic prices and the world prices actually differ, which could indicate that the European beef market has been protected by NTMs.

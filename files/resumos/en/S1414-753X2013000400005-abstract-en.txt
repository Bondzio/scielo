The "participatory forums" of Ilha Grande, having been reactivated and restructured since 2007, have stimulated debates and disputes in which the very concepts about the preservation of nature/culture are at stake. Tourism, the main local economic activity and an important sociocultural phenomenon on the island, has brought about innumerable changes in the region, constituting itself as one of the most debated themes. In its scope, the discussions on heritage have been effective regarding to creation of attractions, products, roadmaps, as well as planning projects. This work aims at reflecting upon the relationship between tourism on Ilha Grande and the ideas of heritage discussed in these forums. It is based on an ethnographic work which was researched and developed between 2007 and 2010, involving the participation and direct observation of the meetings held during the forums as well as interviews with social parties involved.

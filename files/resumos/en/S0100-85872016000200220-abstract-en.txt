It is ritual within the ritual, representing moment of fraternization between families. The article reflects on this ritual in the light of anthropological theory, analyzing it as a sacrifice, whose celebrants are housewives. So, this domestic ritual becomes almost mandatory, the occasion of marking the identity of Pará, invoking the &#8220;Fable of the three races&#8221;, representing the traditional ritual food as the &#8220;pato no tucupi&#8221; (Indian), &#8220;maniçoba&#8221; (African) and codfish (Portuguese).

Abstract This article is based on the thesis proposed in the book "Rio de Janeiro: Transformações na Ordem Urbana" in order to formulate an interpretative synthesis that will clarify the changes evidenced in the metropolis of Rio de Janeiro between 1980-2010's. For this purpose, we retake the historical, theoretical-methodological and analytical elements that were used as contextual references and starting points for the aforementioned work consolidation. One of these elements is the conception of urban order and how it is expressed on the territorial organization of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area. It is shown that patterns of segregation based in the "social distance/territorial proximity, social distance/territorial distance" result from specific relations of social, economic and political power implicated by the maintenance of urban and relative scarcity.

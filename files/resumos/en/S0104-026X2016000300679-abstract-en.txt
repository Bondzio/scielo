Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to map the offensive comments of readers directed to President Dilma Rousseff and analyze the senses related to gender bias in two publications of Folha de S. Paulo newspaper on Facebook. The posts were made on March 16th, 2015 and refer to the first official statement from the president after the pro-impeachment protests on March 15th. Through Discourse Analysis and feminist post-structuralist studies, 1,158 reader's comments were mapped. It was found that 56% of these comments showed sexist offenses. The analysis of these texts resulted in six sense cores, five of them closely related to gender issues: Gaslighting and Manplaining; Mysticism and Religiosity; Hate and Misogyny; Chauvinism and Sexism; and Bropriating.

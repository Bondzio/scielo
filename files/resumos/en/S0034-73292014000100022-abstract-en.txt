We analyze the combined methodology developed by the South-American Defense Council (SDC) for assessing Defense expenditures. We examine its backgrounds, its limitations, its innovations and the profile of Defense budget expenditure. In this region, up to 60% of total Defense budget was allocated to personnel and their social security payroll; on the other hand, research and technology were allocated only 0.5%. From the results, we defend the modernization of both Armed Forces and Defense Ministries in South America, specially a sensible equalization of their expenditure by subject, as a requisite for increasing the sector's budget.

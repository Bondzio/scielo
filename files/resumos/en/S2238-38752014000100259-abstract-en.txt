Abstract In this interview with Andrea Daher at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Nathan Wachtel made a journey &#8203;&#8203;from his vast work experience that allows us to envisage a single work, whose foundation is the joint of the accounts of the living to the letter of the dead, between anthropology and history, in which Indians or Marranos are the agents of the history of "subterranean" America, buried in the achievements of the past, but live in the present traces of memories.

The article aims to emphasize the historicity of the social representations as a basic aspect for the understanding of their processes of generativity and of stabilization of contents. For so, it considers social representations as the consequence, on the one hand, of the appropriation of contents from chronological different periods and, on the other hand, from those contents produced by new contexts. Therefore, the article presents some aspects of the reciprocity between social representations and history of mentalities in order to emphasize that the processes of objectivation and anchorage, which are constitutive of the social representations, are privileged processes for the investigation of this historicity.

AbstractWhile sympathetic to a project of global southern urban theory and its intent, this article is sceptical of the utility of "urban theory from the south". What we need, or lack, is not solely to be addressed by development of a theory from and of the south, for the world is not so simply divided. The article rejects the notion, for instance, that "northern" urban theories are not useful in the south. It suggests instead that theories travel, and in doing so, are richly populated in place, region, networks, and in conversation. Working between Paris, Johannesburg and SÃ£o Paulo, the article calls for thinking in relation, in pathways across conventional terrain of north and south.

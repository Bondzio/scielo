Abstract The effectiveness of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been analyzed through the application of good practice criteria, with emphasis on assessing the quality of studies involved in it. However, such approach is restricted to elements directly linked to the subject of the studies and leaves aside important aspects. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effectiveness of EIA systems through the application of 20 effectiveness criteria to a set of 37 environmental licensing cases in SÃ£o Paulo (SP) and Minas Gerais (MG) states. The results show that the EIA is effective in both states with respect to procedural aspects. On the other hand, the systems were ineffective when it came to substantive effectiveness aspects such as the promotion of public participation, the development of locational alternatives and the assessment of cumulative effects. These aspects increase the proceeding time and limit the EIA influence on decisions, thus being restricted to adjustments in project designs and to the adoption of mitigation/compensation measures.

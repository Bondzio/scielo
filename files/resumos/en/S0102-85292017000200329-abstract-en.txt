Abstract In this article, we analyse one aspect of Brazilian nuclear policy during the tenure of the Workers Party (2003&#8211;2016): the development of a nuclear-propelled submarine. We propose that the project of building a nuclear-propelled submarine has become possible partly because of the mobilisation of a set of arguments for the construction of the South Atlantic as a strategic area, framed in terms of security and development. On the other hand, we contend that the need for a nuclear-propelled submarine is framed through the mobilisation of a specific notion of deterrence. In other words, we claim that the notions of &#8216;strategic area&#8217;, &#8216;general deterrence&#8217;, &#8216;conventional deterrence&#8217;, and &#8216;deterrence by denial&#8217; can help us analyse the fundamental aspects involved in the framing of the South Atlantic as a security concern, justifying the nuclear-propelled submarine project.

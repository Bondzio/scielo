This article's main concern is to define and discuss the concept of democratic education. This discussion is developed based on the concepts and reflections of humanistic pedagogy, especially the social thinking of John Dewey. In this interactive focus, education is understood as a socially circumscribed process, simultaneously capable of modifying structures by forming new types of subjectivity and by articulating with other social struggles. In this sense, the article attempts to show how democratic education points to formative experiences through which children can autonomously structure their subjectivity, without the use of coercion.

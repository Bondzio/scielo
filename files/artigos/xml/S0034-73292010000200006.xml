<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper has    as its main concern the issue of Brazilian military power and its role in the    country's international relations in future years. Specifically speaking, its    goal is to discuss whether a reinforcement of Brazilian military capacity would    be desirable or not, considering the expansion of the country's international    ambitions. Would giving the Brazilian State adequate military devices mean a    growth in national power and in its capacity to influence the world? Or, on    the other hand, would it make Brazil lose its apparently peaceful image and,    therefore, damage the nation's attempts at reaching its goals? These are the    background questions that will be examined in this text.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to achieve    this goal, the article will be divided in several parts. First of all, it will    try to demonstrate one of Brazil's significant characteristics within the countries,    that is, the country's lack of importance in military terms. After that, we    shall ask whether this option for a lack of strategic relevance is something    that is actually conscious or a reaction to historical circumstances and whether    it can (or cannot) be changed in view of the country's new international ambitions.    Finally, starting with an assessment of Brazil's latest military capacities,    the article will attempt to evaluate whether the current initiatives of Luis    In&aacute;cio da Silva's government concerning this issue (the National Defense    Strategy in 2008 and the agreements with France in 2009) represent consistent    steps in a desirable direction or not.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main theme    of this text is, therefore, comprehending the strategic moment is experiencing    and presenting ideas about how the national military machine could be and must    be enhanced in order to fit into the new international scenario and Brazil's    ambitions within it.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Brazil: the    peaceful member of BRIC?</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Talking about the    countries and their role in 21<sup>st</sup> century geopolitics has become almost    a commonplace as Brazil, Russia, India, and China are becoming the protagonists    of international relations during that the beginning of this century. These    four countries constitute the emerging bloc in the area of global decisions    and the can be already seen participating in many multilateral organizations,    in meetings such as the one in Brasilia in 2010 and in several other initiatives.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is certain that    the rise of this bloc (and of other medium-sized countries such as Indonesia,    Mexico and Iran) represents a radical transformation in the global economy and    the distribution of the world power for the foreseeable future. Joint initiatives    from Moscow, Brasilia, New Delhi and Beijing have also had repercussions particularly    in forums like the G20 and others.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is questionable,    however, if there would be a chance for this block to create a common political    philosophy, especially in strategic terms, as the interests of the four of them    are very diverse, with an exception being made in relation to specific issues    such as the search for more space in to confront the traditional power of the    United States and Europe. The BRIC acronym, in fact, indicates a homogeneity    that does not exist.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is more than    that. The use of the BRIC acronym hides an obvious fact, that is, the power    elements available to each of the four nations are too different from each other    and because of that their individual abilities to influence great global decisions    are not exactly the same.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Russia, for instance,    is a military power of the first magnitude with a diplomatic tradition and capacity    to project power, at least in its immediate surroundings. Yet, its economic    recovery is not certain due to it being very much based on oil, its population    declining and with the attractions of its culture to other nations now in decline    (BERTONHA, 2009 and 2009a). India can also boast a reasonable military apparatus    and a growing economy, but its neighbor Pakistan is relatively hostile and its    internal stability can be questioned.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">China has a strong    growing economy, a military apparatus in the process of modernization and a    clearly increasing capacity in terms of international performance. The reasonable    capacity Chinese culture to be exported and its moderate profile within international    relations are also elements in its favor. Nevertheless no-one can be sure if    the Chinese Communist Party will be able to sustain the monumental task of modernizing    that society without tearing the social fabric apart, and the lack of raw materials    and energy could be revealed as problematic in the future as well.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil is starting    from a different baseline. Its economy is more modern and mature than that of    China, India and even Russia and due to that fact, it cannot grow as fast as    its Asian counterparts. The country also faces problems, especially in the educational    field, in order to become a knowledge society and economy. Nonetheless, in the    past years Brazil has presented consistent growth and if it continues along    this path the country will finally join the leading economies in the world.    Resources such as energy, food, and raw materials are also abundant and factors    in favor of sustained national growth.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil's image    in the world is in general a positive one and in a region without great rivals    the country can progress without meeting major problems. Brazilian culture is    much appreciated as well, even with the Portuguese language tending to isolate    it (GRATIUS, 2007: 9), this is also the case concerning its diplomatic tradition,    indicating that at least in terms of 'soft power' the situation is in the very    least potentially positive.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, in relation    to the other countries, the Brazilian situation could be considered quiet. We    have a mature economy and the country has accomplished most of its modernization    process and changed from an agriculture-based country to a modern one. Our culture    is peaceful and appreciated; we are well-regarded by the rest of the world and    our capacity for diplomatic performance, negotiation and acting on the world    stage is positively looked on.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The remaining question    is: are all of these factors enough? Among the four BRIC countries, Brazil is    the only nation that does not have nuclear weapons. Russia, China, as well as    India have the capacity to impose themselves militarily at least on their nearest    neighbors (Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Far East and Indian Ocean Basin),    while the Brazilian capacity to do the same in its surroundings (South America)    is doubtful. The ability to project military resources beyond their immediate    surroundings is limited in all four cases, but the Brazilian capacity is the    smallest of all. Among the countries, not to mention other great global powers,    Brazil is, for the better or for the worse, the least heavily armed. This cannot    be of great importance in a peaceful neighborhood like South America (GRATIUS,    2007: 9), but it limits the international intervention capacity of the country    and poses the as to whether this lack of power is a positive point or not for    the country, and if it is intentional or a simple effect of the country's own    unawareness of the security issue.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Brazil: a peaceful    country by nature?</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There has for a    long time been a myth concerning the Brazilian identity, that is, the myth that    says Brazilians are peaceful people in their beliefs, incapable of wasting time    on civil wars or external conflicts in order to solve disputes or troubles.    Conciliation and negotiation are always preferable and form a positive element    of our society and culture.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is the case    that certain societies, such as some of those in Spanish America, have a cultural    tradition especially in the political field that is much more confrontational    and less willing to negotiate and to adopt a tranquil posture. In spite of that,    we may note that the Brazilian tradition is a myth, especially if we think of    the many accounts of conflicts, slavery, social problems, and urban violence    among other issues that have marked Brazilian history. As a corollary of that    myth there is the idea that Brazil, in its international relations, is a peaceful    country that has abdicated the use of force as a tool for its external politics.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may find some    proof in our history of that so-called Brazilian peaceful character: the two    major military actions of the country outside its boundaries (the Paraguayan    War and the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, during the Second World War) are    almost a century apart from one another and, since then, Brazil has only acted    in peaceful international missions, such as that of the Dominican Republic in    1965, in Africa and in the Middle East and, more recently, in Haiti.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With our neighbors,    we have always had tension that has sometimes reached high levels. There have    actually been some moments, such as that during the military dictatorship, that    Brazilian diplomacy and the armed forces were about to intervene in Chile, Uruguay,    and Bolivia, but those were exceptional periods and Brazil has not been in a    war against its neighbors for more than 140 years, which is undoubtedly an exceptional    long time (Miyamoto, 2009: 24-26).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly, in spite    of our neighbors' continuous memories of Luso-Brazilian expansionism over the    centuries and the occasional concerns that still appear, there is no about the    fact that Brazil's frontiers have been consolidated for a long time and there    was no need of a war to make that happen, but rather negotiation and diplomacy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other contentious    issues are trade questions or the role of Brazil and Argentina in the UN Security    Council. Such problems, however, are not uncommon in the routine of nations    and no-one has ever gone to war because of that. The Brazilian State makes a    great effort not to take regional questions into the defense field and to show    caution in the intentions of its leadership. Mercosur may be understood in the    context of this non-confrontational logic.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerning the    world outside South America, Brazil's intentions have never been based on any    military power, but on mediation, the righteousness of its cause, and the performance    in the many international organizations the country belongs to (Miyamoto, 2009:    24-26).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of this indicates    how the international projection plan so long ago by the Brazilian elite does    not mean taking an aggressive posture toward our neighbors, much less any attempt    to modify the global order by the use of force. Brazil is, to all intents and    purposes, a peaceful country which does not relate its external politics to    the capacity of military projection, choosing instead to opt for dialog and    continuous concessions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, there    is the question of whether this is the posture assumed by the Brazilian elite    or simply an option that has arisen out of circumstances, derived from the cold    evaluation of Brazil's strategic possibilities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alsina Jr. makes    a very closely-argued evaluation of this topic and, in a nutshell, his conclusion    is that, regarding the existence of a national tradition for the resolution    of conflicts throughout negotiation, non-confrontational politics is also a    reflection of a weakness in national military power that will last through the    21<sup>st</sup> century. Hence, the preponderance of diplomacy over armed force    comes from a conciliatory national identity together with the awareness of the    lack of an effective capacity for the use of force.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the idea    that the country rationally chose to maintain its strength at a low base and    to favor negotiation loses strength. It would only be possible if there were    a great capacity for the construction of public policies and their coordination,    subordinating the military to the diplomats, what has never occurred (Alsina    Jr., 2009: 183). The Brazilian problem is that for many reasons (including the    country's relative safety due to its geographic isolation and having few great    rivals in the region) security and defense issues have never received proper    attention and the armed forces have never had significant capacity for the projection    of power in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, which has inevitably meant that the    international issues have been left to the diplomats.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comparing the Brazilian    military actions in the Southern Cone during the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup>    centuries can shed some light on the matter. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century,    despite the modesty of the Brazilian military forces, they had a great deal    of significance in the regional context. The Navy had a reasonable ability to    act in the River Plate Basin and the Empire used force several times in the    region, the climax of this process being the war against Paraguay. Brazilian    diplomats did not hesitate to use force whenever it was necessary and even Baron    Rio Branco during the Republic knew that both aspects of state action complemented    each other.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today, moving the    reflection beyond Brazil and thinking about the regional context, the question    remains whether the region is relatively peaceful and, due to that fact, spends    few resources on the armed forces or whether, on the other hand, its low military    investment implies in few conflicts because of the lack of means.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the data gathered    indicate the low relevance of the continent in strategic terms (Fraga, 2007).    It is evident that objective factors, such as the hegemonic presence of the    United States, the effective action of the countries in the region in the search    for quick solutions to crises (Scardamaglia, 2008) or the lack of much more    serious outbreaks of conflict - be they cultural or economic- (like those in    the Middle East and Asia) help explain the relative peace in the region. The    shortages and problems (drug dealing, crime rates, underdevelopment, and so    on) of the continent's countries and societies also explain why the military    forces have ended up focusing more on police tasks or even politics, in other    times, and have abandoned their central function of preserving the sovereignty    and defense of national interests in terms of other states, which implies contemplating    war against other armed forces.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, the    lack of effective power to deal with any interstate conflict is also an important    element to make the armed forces concentrate more on other tasks (including    UN peace missions and social assistance) than those that have historically defined    them.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In any case, since    the abdication to force or the maintenance of the armed forces as auxiliary    units of the police is and option and not a destiny, we are left with the question    as to whether it is a correct one or not. As the economic conditions of Brazil    improve, would the recovery of a military capacity imply progress or a regression    in terms of the goals of achieving more influence concerning global decisions    and regional peace?</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Military Re-equipment:    a factor of strength or weakness?</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The conciliatory    Brazilian foreign policy could be classified as a typical case of successful    use of 'soft power' to achieve its national objectives. One of its results is    the almost peaceful acceptance of Brazilian leadership in the region. Even if    it is debatable that this leadership is relative because it is considered more    rhetorical than real, it asserts itself and has not been causing excessive apprehension    in the area. Brazil's geopolitical rise does not seem to be creating any alarm    among the great powers either. Thus, we could say that the country's non-use    of force is, in essence, positive.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the main    problem is that the abdication of force does not solve all problems and dilemmas,    especially when there is a relationship with a very powerful state such as the    USA. The hypothesis of a war between Brazil and the USA is remote, but American    power dominates the South Atlantic and it is strongly based in Colombia and    in other countries (Bertonha, 2005; Scardamaglia, 2009), and Brazilian pacifism    will not convince Washington to back away and give Brasilia a strategic monopoly    to the south of Panama. As has been well indicated by Derghougassian (2009),    the renunciation of force may be ethically defendable and may bring advantages,    but it also brings, compared to stronger protagonists, an asymmetry that impairs    relationships and does not always provide good results.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the same way,    a policy excessively based on negotiation may show signs of weakness and may    generate more damage than benefits. This is seen the example of the Bolivian    gas crisis in 2006. Even considering that, essentially, the Brazilian answer    to the Bolivian gas nationalization was a proper one (Bertonha, 2006), there    is some legitimacy in saying that Itamaraty acted in a very complacent way at    the beginning, whereas, if negotiation had been the only way of dealing with    the matter, it does not seem proper to have started them in a subservient position,    accepting everything the other side wanted. Also, some terms and statements    from the Bolivian government took on an anti-Brazilian connotation and deserved    an immediate answer. After some time, under public pressure, the government    reacted, but it was rather late in doing it.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other words,    the answer of president Luis In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's government to this    issue was essentially correct, but if it had had an active decision and pressure    from the very beginning, it would have been more suitable. At the start, Petrobras    seemed to be without any governmental support to react to the <i>fait accompli</i>    and, as has been previously mentioned, hesitation and full acceptance of everything    are not the best way to start any negotiation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps the same    might be said about Mercosur. The trade bloc cannot advance towards a larger    integration and the smaller countries, as Uruguay and Paraguay seem to be less    satisfied day by day. On the other hand, Argentina is more concerned about protecting    its commercial flow with Brazil by means of some maneuvers (totally against    the main proposal of a trade bloc) than deepen the association between them.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outside Mercosur,    the South-American Union seems to be a myth. Venezuela, despite its current    crisis, has consolidated itself, although there is a great mythology involving    it as an alternative leader in the region, while Colombia has gone towards a    closer relationship with the United States. Mexico and the Central America are    practically a part of US territory. Thus, union seems to exist only on paper.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Brazil and its    foreign policy cannot be responsible for everything. However, as the biggest    and most powerful country on the continent, Brazil should take some responsibility    for the Latin-American integration problems. The entire South-American union    project - essential to the region's progress, its competitive integration within    the globalized market and its international projection - can only be done with    Brazil at the center and then only the Brazilian leadership can deal with this    project successfully. Nevertheless, Brazil seems to hesitate when it has to    use its power and influence to accelerate and keep this process running.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The position assumed    by Brazil seems to be correct in order not to impose a hegemonic position or    back away in front of the requests from its poorer or discontented neighbors.    But this wish to show goodwill may be seen as a weakness and no leadership can    be seen in this light.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The renunciation    of military hegemony in the South-American continent may not be an adequate    response, being more self-defeating than valid. After all, a real capacity for    intervention in the region when the Bolivian crisis appeared, for instance,    could have given not just more options to the President of the Republic, but    also led the Bolivian government to moderate its actions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper does    not suggest bombing Montevideo city to prevent Uruguay from leaving Mercosur,    obtaining Bolivian gas with a large army, or blocking Buenos Aires harbor in    order to bring Argentina back into the Mercosur project. But a stronger position    (even if the definition of 'strength' might be difficult) may be necessary to    advance the integration project.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this way, the    conclusion offered by this paper is that the conciliatory position of Brazil    in regard to its neighbors and the world, taking into account its effort to    negotiate and arbitrate between opposing sides, is a merit, a tradition of the    country that must be protected and supported. However, the acquisition by the    country of a reliable military capability would not be the renunciation of this    policy; it would actually support that policy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As was previously    mentioned by Myamoto (2009: 29), the possibility of Brazil making demands in    the international scenario has always been blocked by two variables: less power    (economic, political and military) and no chances given to it by the great powers.    A stronger army would decrease these disadvantages and give more credibility    to Brazilian foreign policy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actually, the discourse,    the rhetoric and good intentions are not enough to bring equality to the powerless,    which is the main problem. Bras&iacute;lia can try to impose itself as a good    actor that deserves a role in the Middle East scenario, for instance, but, due    to the lack of power (not just military) of the country to make interventions    and mediate, the effort may not be worthwhile.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When the recent    earthquake occurred in Haiti this situation became visible. When the USA decided    to help the victims of that disaster, it used a huge amount of recourses, including    an aircraft carrier, a hospital ship, helicopters and all the necessary tools    to send help. Before this demonstration of military power, even if it was used    for humanitarian purposes, the Brazilian government had to accept, at least    at first, a secondary position in the control of the international help to those    victims. Facing a huge material power, even in humanitarian missions, goodwill    and kindness are not enough.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The present writer    strongly subscribes to Alsina Jr's (2009: 187-189) conclusions that without    the military power, the country is constrained in its relations and autonomy    relation to the great powers and even its own national 'soft power' and diplomacy    decrease in credibility. I also agree with his conclusion that the ownership    of a limited, but real capacity of conventional dissuasion would be useful to    the foreign policy interests of Brazil and its development.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we consider    the question, it is understandable how military power is effective when it is    used. Making use of Nye (2004: 31) and Alsina Jr's (2009: 175) reflections,    it is possible to realize that military power has a direct side and also a symbolic    one, demonstrating its limits to others. In this way, the military power does    not need to be used but it needs to be reliable, in other words, it must not    exist symbolically, without a material base. Then, to discuss which military    system we need to achieve our new political and symbolical goals is consequently    the main point at the moment.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Brazil's strategic    goals and its required military capacity</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rosendo Fraga (2009)    presents the current Brazilian defense policy linked to three dimensions. The    first, local or national, would represent the State reaffirming its role as    holder of the monopoly of violence inside national territory and in the absolute    occupation of it. The second, regional or South-American, would imply stability    and peace in the continent, while the third, global, would indicate an aspiration    for global affirmation as a power worthy of respect.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the first level,    internal problems as the fight against the drug trade would be present. On the    second, there would be the conflicts with the USA due to matters like the reactivation    of the 4th Fleet or the Colombian bases and the effort to moderate Hugo Ch&aacute;vez    and create regional defense structures. On the third level, there would be the    explanation of Brazil's effort to obtain a nuclear submarine, which would show    the world that the country has reached a further technological and strategic    stage.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It can be doubted    whether the national defense policy is as articulated and pondered as that author    affirms, but he is able to summarize in a very good way the problems and the    main questions to be taken into consideration in any defense strategy in the    future.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we think about    the current situation, the chances of inter-state conflict are low. The world    has a superpower (the United States) and other middle-level powers and it maintains    its stability. Since the end of the Cold War there have hardly been any wars    among the great powers and there seems to be little chance of there being others    in the foreseeable future.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this scenario,    since the only military power which is able to beat Brazil is the USA and it    has not shown interests in doing so (since our differences are few and negotiable),    the immediate necessity of military equipment - possibly nuclear - to confront    Washington is small.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we take into    account that Brazil does not even have in its region any enemy that can threaten    it as a sovereign nation, and that risks to national security due to the drug    trade or gangs are moderate, we make say that we do not have any immediate challenge    or a real risk to the national territory. Potentially, there are always risks,    even more so in a context of decrease of mineral, food and energy resources    that the country has in large quantity, but those risks are only potential ones.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering the    second main goal, the maintenance of peace and order in South America, the situation    is also comfortable. South America, as has been previously mentioned, is very    peaceful and its security problems are almost irrelevant in the world scenario.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, this does    not mean that there have not been conflicts or that there is no risk of violence    in the region (Scardamaglia, 2008; Alsina Jr., 2009). So it is essential that    Brazil has military tools to act beyond its frontiers both in the case of peaceful    missions and in the protection of national interests, showing, even symbolically,    its leadership in the continent.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, in order    to achieve credibility as an actor able to act effectively in global decisions,    Brazil needs to acquire suitable instruments of power. Nuclear instruments are    not under discussion, but some capacity of action - by air, water or by land    - to take part in collective actions outside the continent probably would be    necessary, with modern equipment compatible to that used by the great powers.    One or more nuclear submarines seem to be especially suitable to this purpose.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, that would    be the military capacity that Brazil might try to acquire in the years to come,    that is, a medium-level one. It implies having suitable power to protect the    territory and the national airspace against unequal intimidation and some dissuasion    against the strongest sates; a capacity for complete action in case of bringing    about stabilization in South America and some global action in association with    other states. This would be a level of power that would be suitable to Brazil's    local and global intentions and that would be enough to achieve those intentions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the moment,    it is necessary to verify if the Brazilian army is close to the minimum level    suggested and if the recent steps taken by the Brazilian government - through    the release of the National Defense Strategy document in 2008 and the agreement    signed with France in 2009 - may indicate progress in this direction.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Current Brazilian    military power and its immediate future</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 2007-2008, Brazilian    military capacity seemed to be at its lowest level. An article written by the    present writer (Bertonha, 2008), indicated how dramatic the situation was. Even    with 300,000 soldiers the Brazilian military machine was almost static due to    the lack of modern equipment, maintenance and training. The Army only had second-hand    German and American tanks and armored fighting vehicles from the 1970s, of which    just 30% were operational. Its antiaircraft artillery had to be aimed and fired    manually and its artillery was obsolete.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Air Force only    had light aircraft or some, such as F-5s, therefore out of commission although    it was receiving some supersonic Mirage-2000. From its 719 military aircraft,    just 267 were operational; the rest were in the repair parks or grounded due    to lack of parts. The FAB did not have modern aircraft, attack helicopters or    medium range air-to-air missile and its pilots only trained 80 hours per year.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Navy, less    than half of the ships and submarines were operational and few ships were new.    The nuclear submarine project was making a slow progress and the few expected    acquisitions would not compensate for the units that would become obsolete.    The morale of officers and men in the three forces was not good due to the low    salaries and low prestige.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to international    analysts (Calle, 2007) Chile had the most modern and well trained military force    in the continent, even though numerically smaller compared to the other nations.    In the annual report <i>Military Power Review</i> (Calle, 2007: 34-35) of that    year, it was considered that Chile had already reached the third position in    the rank of military forces in Latin America behind Brazil and Peru, almost    overcoming the latter. Venezuela had gone from seventh to fifth place in the    ranking and Argentina had reached fourth place. The prediction was that if Brazil    did not react, despite its large number of soldiers, it would lose its position    as the leading military power in the region.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This realization    caused a reaction d. After 2007, Parliament and the Executive increased the    resources to conclude old projects, such as the nuclear submarine and rockets    to launch satellites into outer space and to strengthen the armament industry.    The military budget also increased by 50% in 2008 and many equipment programs    for the military forces were approved. The government also increased spending    on defense from 1.5% to 2.7% of GDP and released a National Defense Strategy,    which will be discussed below.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Army prioritized    the acquisition of a new fleet of wheeled armored fighting vehicles, the operation    of the new Special Forces brigades, its antiaircraft and communication capacity    and bridges and boats for operations in the Amazon basin. The Navy wants a nuclear    submarine, modernization and the construction of conventional submarines, new    torpedoes, helicopters and command and control systems, while the Air Force    has reopened the negotiations to get new fighters, has modernized the AMX and    obtained around one hundred Super <i>Tucanos</i> for training and counter insurgency    operations. In addition, with the arrival of great innovative weapons, such    as some MI-35 Russian attack helicopters (a casual acquisition, based on commercial    negotiations with the Russians), the Air Force has reached a new technological    and operational level.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the present    writer's view, it is not clear yet what led Luis In&aacute;cio da Silva's government    to provide privileges to an area that had almost forgotten in his first mandate.    Calle (2007 and 2009) mentions that, since the end of the dictatorship period,    there had been a kind of tactical agreement between civilians and the military:    the latter would not be punished for the crimes committed in the dictatorship    period and the military cast would have more autonomy in return for accepting    low budgets. Moreover, due to the military collapse in Argentina and the economic    crisis in the 1980s and 90s, there would be no reason for providing resources    for armaments.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nowadays, according    to the same author, the economic and fiscal situation of the country has improved    and many concerns have appeared such as: the growth of organized crime, the    consolidation of Ch&aacute;vez' position in Venezuela, signs of international    increasing interest in Brazilian oil and raw materials, the rise of native nationalism    in Bolivia and the reinforcement of the American presence in Colombia and other    countries, all of which have required increasing Brazil's military capacity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other authors,    such as Noro (2009) and Oliveira (2008: 142) describe the great crisis of the    FAB in 2007, giving increasing rearmament and tension in the Amazon and Andean    regions as reasons for the new government's attention to the issue. Nevertheless,    although all those issues - together with the presence of such a dynamic and    active personality as Jobim at the Defense Ministry - had been important, the    chain of events that led Luis In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's Government to this    reversal of its position in the defense area is not yet clear.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is remarkable    is that President Lula, an ex-trade union leader and victim of the military    dictatorship, is the president who has led the recovery of the nation's military    power, in a situation that is almost the opposite of that in Argentina. There,    the military lost their political power and subsequent democratic governments    have tended to assume a confrontation posture in relation to the Armed Forces,    which almost explains how they arrived at the critical operative, logistic and    moral situation in which they find themselves (Bertonha, 2007; Hang, 2007; Calle,    2007 and Corbacho, 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, in spite    of the recent acquisitions of arms, Brazilian military force is limited and    far short of the desired minimum. To bring this situation in line with what    is hoped for, there would need to be new investments and special care taken    in planning them, which would imply an emphasis on quality instead of quantity    and a review of some points of the National Defense Strategy that was approved    in 2008.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Brazilian National    Defense Strategy in 2008</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The evaluation    that this paper makes of the Brazilian armed forces at present is essentially    correct: precarious, old-fashioned and technologically obsolete equipment, troop    concentration in less sensitive areas, little coordination among the forces,    purchases based on opportunity instead of on real needs, a defective mobilization    system, an almost nonexistent industrial-military complex and dependence on    foreign equipment and technology.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the solutions    discussed are difficult to disagree with: emphasis on defending the Amazonian    region, which would result in a subsequent removal of armed forces from S&atilde;o    Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other central states; better coordination between    the forces, including common purchase policies and, wherever possible, harmonization    of equipment and emphasis on flexibility and agility, with a massive use of    technology.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The National Defense    Strategy also correctly states that it is impossible for a country like Brazil,    with its economic limitations, to be strong in all sectors, which leads to the    establishment of priorities for each armed force. Such priorities are the right    ones for the moment: that is, the denial of access to and use of Brazilian seas    by hostile powers, vigilance and control of air space and the creation of mobile    and flexible Army brigades for immediate action in all national territory, but    mainly in Northern Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are the strong    points of the paper. It advocates collaboration between military personnel and    civilians and points out the need for updating technology. It also clearly defines    the problems of the Armed Forces, indicates priorities and establishes lines    of action to solve problems and to meet all the country's needs. Even so, it    has some structural weaknesses that slightly decrease its worth.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first is that,    although the paper establishes priorities, some existing proposals divert resources    and effort from the aforesaid priorities. One of them is that the Navy must    keep some capacity for power projection. This is not an absurd goal: it is even    desirable, in the light of Brazil's international goals for the near future.    The problem is, projecting power is a very complex, expensive task for any Navy,    because it means having not only a full-time Marine Corps ready for action but    also huge ships and some kind of aircraft carrier. Would there be resources    enough for a Navy which projects power at a sufficient level to discourage attack?    This is hardly likely, which points to the need for further thinking on this    point.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the same time,    there is move to reverse the trend of the professionalization in the Armed Forces    in favor of compulsory service even strengthening the <i>Tiros de Guerra</i>    (military reservists). Such a proposal is understandable from the point of view    that military, especially the Army, has a role as builder of nationality and    citizenship, but hardly stands up to scrutiny when we take into account the    need to form mobile, highly trained units, equipped with advanced technologies.    Even though the draft provides soldiers at a low cost, their efficiency is arguable    and might compromise resources that would be better employed in other projects.    In a context of limited resources, the wisdom of such a policy remains doubtful.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is important    to prioritize and reduce investments in retirement funds, salaries and numbers    in order to reinforce technology, mobility and adequate instruments with clear    goals in mind. Brazil, like other Latin American countries, spends too much    on salaries, pensions and other expenses (Donadio, 2007; Comparative, 2008,    p. 48-49 and Bertonha, 2008) and, without reducing those, there is no way to    support the improvement of quality in the Armed Forces. The National Defense    Strategy does not seem to do me concerned about this point.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The basic premise    of the document is that Brazil will grow to become one of the world's main powers    but "without hegemony or domination. Brazil does not want to rule over other    nations. It shall grow without ruling." Such a premise is, at least, arguable.    As already indicated in this paper, a state that aims to occupy an important    position in the world's balance of power cannot just refuse to exert power.    Imagining that the exercise of power is automatically bad and something Brazil    will renounce forever simply compromises the country's credibility in the eyes    of neighboring countries and the international community.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nevertheless, among    the positive and negative points, the simple fact of the document having been    written is an immense step forward for the defense sector, simply because now    there is a good, solid starting point to be discussed: what are Brazil's military    needs for the coming years and decades? The same feeling of moving in the right    direction comes when the 2009 strategic treaties with France are examined.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The treaties    signed with France in 2009</b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The strategic partnership    between Brazil and France has been in existence for some years and its limitations    are obvious. Firstly, its goals are not clear. A desire for symbolic opposition    to the United States of America and to show independence from Washington seems    to one of its motivations, but neither Paris nor Brasilia wishes to take this    opposition into the military and strategic fields, since Washington is a preferred    ally for both countries.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, it is doubtful    whether Paris would abandon its key alliances, such as NATO, the European Union    or with the USA, in order to favor Brazil. How much would Brazil and France    be willing to invest in this alliance? Paris and Brasilia seem ready to accept    some burdens but only to a certain point (Rudzit &amp; Nagami, 2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the treaty    with France meets current Brazilian military and strategic aims perfectly. It    allows, geopolitically and symbolically, a level of distancing from American    power but without giving Washington cause for fear. A strategic partnership    with Russia or China would have been a red flag to the Americans but not one    with France. Thus, Brazilian independence and new confidence are symbolically    asserted without alarming Washington. Another sign of Brasilia's desire to maintain    a good relationship with the USA was the signing of a strategic cooperation    agreement in 2010.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In practical terms,    the purchase of French war materiel in huge quantities is appropriate for the    country's goals. The jet fighters to be acquired will probably be the <i>Rafale    (</i>or, if the political scene changes, equivalents such as the F-18 or <i>Grippen</i>)    and the availability of some dozens of them will guarantee full control of Brazilian    air space and continental supremacy. The fifty <i>Super Cougar</i> helicopters    and other French equipment will ensure mobility for the Army's brigades on short-range    expeditions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But definitely    more crucial are the submarines, specially the nuclear one. Having one or more    of these at its disposal and, moreover, being able to build and maintain one,    will give the country the necessary capacity to deal with other foreign powers    in the foreseeable future. And, most importantly, this will put the country    on a new strategic level, ending the situation of Brazil being the only unarmed    BRIC country and broadening the scope of the country's international performance.    German combat cars, new wheeled combat vehicles, Italian naval materiel or American    electronic war equipment might be useful, but these aircraft, helicopters and    submarines will be the military power basis the country will need in the coming    years.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the new jet    fighters, nuclear submarines and the intended purchase of ships and naval equipment    from Italy, Spain and the USA, Brazil will also have the continent's most powerful    naval force by 2020. That will mean, both symbolically and practically, abandoning    the old idea of continental balance and establishing a new kind of hegemony.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In global terms,    Brazil will become a significant power strategically and will be able to collaborate    with men and arms in international operations related to its interests. Brazil    will leave behind the previously mentioned condition of being the only unarmed    emerging power, which would boost a possible claim for a seat on the UN Security    Council (even though it would not guarantee it) and in other areas of international    discussion.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also relevant is    the task of guaranteeing not only the acquisition of weapons but also technology,    which, at the proper moment, will enable Brazil to build its own nuclear submarines    and, in the medium term, to create a national fifth-generation jet fighter force.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course nothing    is ever perfect. Would Brazil really have the critical mass in intellectual    and enterprise terms to absorb French technology and would that technology be    completely transferred? Would the plans and projects continue after the da Silva    government ends? Acquiring this amount of material from only one source might    bring also future difficulties if, for any reason, the relationship with Paris    deteriorates. Even so, the agreements with France are coherent with current    Brazilian military needs and allow for practical solutions to some of the National    Defense Strategy problems previously pointed out. Moreover, they indicate a    maturity in long-term planning that must be commended.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certain conceptual    confusions are specially damaging in social relationships and among states and    institutions. In the field of education, after years of military regime, many    education experts tend to see any kind of authority as authoritarianism, leading    to questioning the teacher's role and to huge classroom crises. The same could    perhaps be said about parental authority in families.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A confusion to    be avoided in international relations is that between the exercise of power    and imperialism, as if any and all authority was bad and led to an empire which    would treat its subordinates with violence and would dominate other nations.    This is something to be avoided. But to be at the top of the world means to    have power and to exert it; refusing to do so is simply to go down to the lowest    level and even be manipulated by others. Just as authority is not authoritarianism,    exerting power is not automatically imperialism and to forget these distinctions    might be dangerous for the common good.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this sense,    the proposal of this paper is that Brazil should use its resources in 'soft    power' (culture, empathy, language) terms and within its laudable peaceful diplomatic    tradition, but 'hard power' cannot be forgotten, as found in economic and military    power, in the country's quest for a better position on the international scene,    which is necessary even if only for its own development. Without 'hard power',    cultural links or diplomacy become less important or credible and by themselves    they cannot change reality.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, the    demand for a future Brazilian military structure is quite small, considering    the country's privileged national strategic situation. Without adjacent enemies    and not being really threatened by extra-regional enemies, there is no need    for more than a small, but credible, dissuasive capacity (air and naval) to    guarantee national security. Beyond this, the important thing is to guarantee    some capacity for projecting power and symbolic hegemony on the South American    continent - and, on a smaller scale, in the world - in order to better support    Brazil's entry on the international scene and to do away with the idea that    Brazil is the only BRIC country that does not have to be considered on strategic    matters.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian economy    is strong enough to support the necessary expense and the military forces have    the structure and critical mass needed to absorb new weapons and technology.    If the armed forces opt for quality instead of quantity, the cost for society    would decrease, while their suitability for Brazilian international goals would    increase. Such a positive scenario seems to have been created during President    Luis In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva's second term and, hopefully, for the years    to come.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Bibliographical    references</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALSINA JR., Jo&atilde;o    Paulo Soares (2009).

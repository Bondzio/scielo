Abstract This is an epidemiological study on violence against rural women, based on data from public safety in small and medium-sized municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul. The objective was to trace and analyze the geoepidemiological profile of these events from perspectives Sociological The idea is maintained that social inequalities limit or even impede the full exercise of citizenship, forming a factor of vulnerability. Violence becomes a health problem because it affects individual and collective health, demanding the formulation of public policies to deal with it. The results indicated increased rates of violence in cities with the worst socioeconomic indexes. It is considered that the implementation of health, employment, education and income policies can help in the fight against discrimination and victimization based on gender asymmetries.

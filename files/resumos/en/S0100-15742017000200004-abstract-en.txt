ABSTRACT This study attempts to capture the full picture of educational development in an emerging country that is characterized by both high economic development and high socioeconomic inequality. A two-step model is used in this study. The first step uses the variables that are directly related to education to capture the educational efficiency of each municipality; the second step uses a statistical Tobit model to estimate the influence of the non-discretionary variables on the educational efficiency found in the first step. A previous categorization by clusters is also implemented to ensure a fair comparison among homogeneous municipalities. The results show significant discrepancies in the influence of socioeconomic variables on educational outcome, which depends on the welfare of the cluster.

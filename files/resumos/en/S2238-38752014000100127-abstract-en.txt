Abstract The article compares the intellectual trajectories of Gino Germani (1911-1979) and Florestan Fernandes (1920-1995) in order to reveal aspects not previously problematized in the literature. This movement is accomplished by a reconstruction of the institutionalization contexts of sociology in Argentina and Brazil, where the characters led very ambitious and decisive academic projects to the discipline legitimization in both countries.

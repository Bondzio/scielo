AbstractThe term diaspora has been the subject of numerous studies describing the experiences Jewish, Greek and Armenian diasporas. From the 1990s, its use became widespread, making it common in everyday language. In this paper, we seek to focus the ethnographic content of the word among Haitians, exploring the social meanings of the category of diaspora (and the semantic field constitutes). It is shown how this is central category for understanding the social meanings of mobility in the Haitian (trans)national space, describing people, objects, houses, money and practices.

There has been a growing development of scientific works on migratory issues from a feminist or gender perspective in the last decades. This article intends to be included in this tradition as it exposes the specificities that generate this type of studies in Latin American societies. Precisely, the article presents some reflections on how Bolivian women and men immigrants in Argentina (Ushuaia) understand their migratory trajectories. We propose a typology of the migratory trajectories to describe and understand the distinct perceptions of migration for these women and men. This work will also serve as a basis for the discussion of the classic dichotomies existing in migratory studies and policies, as family reunification x labor migration, rational migration x affection migration and associative migration x autonomous migration.

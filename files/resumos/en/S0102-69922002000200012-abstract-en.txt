This article examines at the anthropologist and his/her subjectivity in anthropological fieldwork about body appearence in Rio de Janeiro. This paper considers the many roles that the appearance and the subjectivity plays with the production of anthropological knowledge and texts.This paper tries to demonstrate how the subjectivity and the physical appearance of an anthropologist can constitute a powerful vantage point from which to call into question a number of central anthropological premises, such as the nature of fieldwork, the use of the senses, the constitution of subjectivity in reflexive understanding, and the validity and meaning of the self-other dichotomy. By examining my experiences and relationships while I was doing my fieldwork in Anthropology of the Appearance in Rio de Janeiro, my intention was to show how each fieldwork specificity obliges the anthropologist to challege perspectives and offers him the challenge of rethinking Anthropology itself.

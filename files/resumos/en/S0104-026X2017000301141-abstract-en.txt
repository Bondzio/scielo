Abstract: The present article relates the results of a research conducted between 2013 and 2015, which aimed to understand aspects of the experiences of women who have had illegal abortion. Eight women were interviewed. Unlike most studies on the theme, in the present investigation the majority of the women had high educational level and were involved with the feminist movement. We report the motivations for having an abortion, the details from the decision-making process and the influence of feminist ideas in the process of the womenÂ´s decision.

Abstract: There are several researchers who have dealt with the study of social movements, however, some of them have been, in a certain way, "invisiblized" by the Social Sciences, the Social Movements of Consensus. Under this typology, a great variety of organizations and interests are grouped together, including some feminine movements. In this article, I turn my attention to a non-feminist and consensus feminist movement, the Cancer Social Movement. This analysis was based on the development of the Social Cancer Movement in the English-speaking developed countries, especially the United States, to argue that this movement emerges as a neoliberal device through which there is, in contemporary Western societies, a control over women in general, and particularly, those with breast cancer.

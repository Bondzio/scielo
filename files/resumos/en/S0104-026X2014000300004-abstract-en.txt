This work presents a study about the representations of gender violence &#45; focusing on femicide, &#45; in contemporary Brazilian literature. The article analyses how the gender violence and the femicide &#45; the killing of women &#45; are constructed in the short&#45;story "A língua do P" (1974), by Clarice Lispector, and "Venha ver o pôr do sol" (1970), by Lygia Fagundes Telles. These narratives describe the subtleties of the symbolic violence, the aggressiveness of the sexual violence and the brutality of the calculated murder, respectively. Methodologically the study takes the different approaches of the Social Sciences and Feminist Theories concerning Maria da Penha Law and gender violence proposed by Constância Lima Duarte, Lia Zanotta Machado and Rita Laura Segato.

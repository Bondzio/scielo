This study starts out considering the changes which have occurred in the field of sexualities as a consequence of the feminist movement of the past 50 years, mainly the collapse of frontiers between man-public and woman-private. From this point, it demonstrates how the displacements of the feminine, in the midst of the crisis of the masculine, constitute a new topos to think the difference between the sexes in contemporary culture. The study proceeds with the idea, based on some of the main theories about the issue of difference nowadays, that we are not in a territory which is totally anchored by &#8216;masculine domination&#8217;, neither in one characterized by total &#8216;indifference&#8217;. A new possibility of differentiation arises, and with it, a new sketch of the feminine.

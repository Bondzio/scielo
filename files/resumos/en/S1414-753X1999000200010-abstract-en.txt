This work introduces the debate between environmental issues and education, through an analysis of some educational proposals concerning the environment. It takes as its point of departure the supposition that dominant educational proposals tend to emphasize technical and biological aspects of environmental issues, in detriment to its essential political and ethical dimensions. This tendency reduces the complexity of environmental issues and favours conservative, depoliticized and unsustainable educational conceptions and practices.

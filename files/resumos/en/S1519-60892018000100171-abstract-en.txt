Abstract: This work is based on a research conducted in a 3D virtual world and other digital platforms to discuss new forms of self-experimentation in contemporary digital media. We emphasize the creative uses and appropriations of these platforms in gender and sexuality experimentations and we propose to think of these technologies as agents of new processes of subjectivation.

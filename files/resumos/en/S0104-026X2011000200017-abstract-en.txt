The text focuses on reporting and analyzing school scenes, as a result of ethnography in elementary and middle school classrooms in Porto Alegre, Brazil. In these scenes questions of gender and sexuality are involved. The scenes selected deal with issues involving the school's educational autonomy; scientific learning and socialization processes in the school environment; secular public education; appreciation of diversity; inclusion strategies; policies of gender equity; quality of school learning; role of the teacher as an adult reference; specificities of public education. Preference is given to intersections of gender and sexuality with race, social class, religion, morals and family generation. In the end, we establish some general principles for working with gender and sexuality in school.

As measures to prevent students from failing, learning cycles put an end to the fragmentation arising from grading and. They imply changes to the conception of time, space and school culture itself, with the purpose of assuring that the great number of students who were until not long ago excluded from basic school may continue education and acquire socially relevant knowledge.

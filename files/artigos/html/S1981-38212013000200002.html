Researchers and scientists&nbsp;have had their activities redefined through    new organizational formats that today are well-established. The purpose here    is to verify the impacts that these tendencies have had on the scientific and    technological production of Public Research Institutes. We analyzed the case    of the Technological Research Institute (Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnol&oacute;gicas    - IPT) and found that from the 1990s onwards, research institutions in Brazil    internalized organizational forms that enabled them to place themselves in the    international agenda as reputational agents, and that the IPT internalized an    international agenda, hiring new services and with new budgets. The institutions    of scientific research tended to align their interests with hegemonic devices    and to withdraw the participation of agents not able to make explicit the new    formulas for recognition in the scientific field.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Keywords:</b>    Science and technology policies; public research institutes; Brazil; IPT; researchers</font></p> <hr noshade size="1"/>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper discusses    how technological production has been suffering the effects of international    transformations in terms of the institutional reorganization of research centers    and changes in the development of funding for innovation practices. Technicians    and scientists, who have traditionally been central to technological development,&nbsp;have    had their activities redefined through new organizational formats which today    are well-established.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The globalization    and internationalization of science represent tendencies that have strongly    affected the constitution of social groups that lead technological practice    in a global context. Today it is possible to detect global processes of connection    among companies, laboratories and public research institutions creating science    and technology, which are both localized and asymmetrical (Albert and Laberge,    2007; Gingras, 2002; Vessuri, 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question that    now arises for the peripheral countries is: what impact has the internationalization    of scientific research had on national institutions? How have national scientific    elites been behaving in light of the new parameters of technological research    funding?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this new scenario,    the formation of a new kind of science creates an agreement between the research    community and market interests. The purpose of this text is to verify the impacts    that these tendencies have had on the scientific and technological productivity    of the Public Research Institutes. To elucidate these questions, we analyze    the case of the Technological Research Institute (Instituto de Pesquisas Tecnol&oacute;gicas    - IPT), part of the University of S&atilde;o Paulo (USP) and linked to the Development,    Economy, Science and Technology&nbsp;Department of the state of S&atilde;o Paulo.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With this case    study, we intend to analyze how innovation policies have interfered in the organizational    criteria of the Institute and its scientific production, and where researchers    and technicians stand regarding the new innovation policies. From a discussion    on organizational logics, the transformations taking place in Public Research    Institutions (Institui&ccedil;&otilde;es P&uacute;blicas de Pesquisa - IPPs)    can be observed over time (Salles-Filho et al., 2000).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Firstly, Science    and Technology policy in Brazil will be discussed, as well as its implications    for research activities. Then, the text will discuss the Brazilian IPPs, seeking    to emphasize the historical changes they have been undergoing and how these    imply an adherence to tendencies arising in the international context. Finally,    the case of the IPT - an illustrative example of the internationalization of    new scientific practices in the IPPs - will be briefly discussed.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Globalization,    Science &amp; Technology</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Noble's analysis    (1988) of technological development in the US shows deep connections between    the country's economic system, scientific culture and technological practice.    In Noble's opinion, from the beginning of the 20th century, the US began to    experience the emergence of a great military-industrial-scientific complex,    whose internal coherence gradually solidified. The subsequent spread of this    model to other countries and the globalization of Research &amp; Development    (R&amp;D) led to a major shift in the relationship between science, technology    and innovation practices.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Electrical and    chemical industries formed the cutting edge of this process as they synergistically    interlinked industry and science for the first time in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.    Engineers, especially electrical and chemical ones, became the elite of this    technological development as they began to hold highly significant positions    in diverse strategic institutions such as universities, technical colleges and    scientific organizations, and on the corporate boards of private enterprises.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The holding of    these skilled positions meant that a specific sort of knowledge achieved a privileged    position in major industrial segments and decisively influenced the areas of    corporate governance and planning of university research and undergraduate programs    in technological fields, especially engineering.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">...engineers      with scientific training, taken up by large corporations, merged the demands      of monopoly capitalism and modern technology into a formal system. The modern      management, which in engineering represented a shift in focus from the natural      to the social realm, from the forces of production to social relations, was      a deliberate attempt to alleviate the tension between the two, causing both      to fit within the limits of monopoly capitalism. (Noble, 1988: 27)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This systematization    of activities involving a rational management of business, technical training,    professionalization and participation in scientific organizations allowed some    branches of engineering to control the structuring of a highly hierarchized    and strategic field, reconciling economic, managerial and scientific interests    in favor of monopoly capital. Engineering took on a position of undisputed leadership    and started to disseminate its scientific values and technological design in    different branches of the economy. The behavior of public agencies, enterprises    and universities points to a convergence of interests between previously dispersed    elites.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A similar process    took place in Brazil throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century, except engineering    was extremely dependent - both politically and in terms of resources - on government    departmentalism, which prevented it from getting its values across as fiercely    as in the core countries (Kawamura, 1981).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the late 19<sup>th</sup>    and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, there was an urgent need to organize large    industries according to both administrative and technical skills. For this,    it was essential to ensure space for a privileged group of workers with these    two characteristics. These groups of professionals were responsible for systematizing    and quantifying the operations of important corporate groups, improving accounting    methods, estimating expenditures and processing statistical data for various    purposes. The hierarchization of functions and intersectoral reporting were    also set up by standardizing procedures and by the monopolization of technical    expertise and administrative tools under the control of an elite of skilled    engineers, who held strategic positions in North American corporations, and    who later disseminated their precepts and procedures to corporate and scientific    institutions worldwide.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After World War    II, the radicalization of these trends and the influence of other agents were    noticeable. There was a great increase in the participation by the military    and public sectors in funding science and technological innovation. The US government's    participation in establishing the technological agenda strengthened the elite    group formed within the canons of electrical engineering and led to a connection    of once-dispersed sectors, such as biophysics, biochemistry and other neighboring    areas (Velho, 2011).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Latin America,    North American institutions were vital for the development of strategic scientific    areas. From the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Rockefeller Foundation    enabled staff training in health to take place, interacting intensely with national    institutions and sending professionals for training abroad (Faria, 2007). American    scientific philanthropy, coupled with the modernizing impulse of our elites    in the first decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, is a successful example    of international connections that enabled the development of an innovative project    for health policy in an underdeveloped nation still aligned to a traditional    way of living, institutionally speaking.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Economic globalization,    which began mainly in the 1980s, had a dramatic impact on the reconfiguration    of these ruling groups in terms of science and technology (Humbert, 2005). Companies    that were leaders in certain areas, such as chemical and pharmaceutical industries,    began to invest heavily in technology and establish networks beyond national    boundaries, sharing expertise and ways of working in different continents. These    groups began to articulate in an increasingly synergistic and complementary    fashion, establishing a closer dialogue between technology production centers    and technology consumers. This differentiation was no longer very clear once    producers and consumers began sharing a growing amount of technological expertise    due to the reticular behavior of large corporations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Humbert (2005)    points out that there were great changes in the technological and scientific    policies of large enterprises, which created an increased presence of relevant    activities in companies located in less privileged places.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many authors used    to emphasize that multinational firms were conveying obsolete or outdated technologies    and that it was not a full transference, and that it was generally overpriced.    The globalization of technology was contained within a unique context; multinational    firms are no longer reluctant to conduct Research &amp; Development - R&amp;D    - abroad, not only in industrialized countries but also in underdeveloped nations...    thanks also to the decentralization allowed by the development of Information    Technology - IT. (Humbert, 2005: 275)</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other words,    dominant scientific groups present in the core nations began to establish a    closer dialogue with the ruling groups of peripheral countries through the dissemination    of expertise in technologically integrated laboratories, sharing patents and    inputs. The design of products with potential for global reach, the internal    disputes at large corporations in bidding processes for the exploitation of    technological products, and the growing rates of enrolment in educational institutions    in different parts of the world allowed for opportunities to be shared, privileged    groups to be trained in diverse centers and for decentralized decision-making.    Large transnational firms began to experience what some analysts call technological    diversification, a new way of integrating expertise and project development    opportunities. According to Gomes's (2003) analysis:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Technological diversification    became an important feature in TNCs to the extent that subsidiaries abroad have    played specific roles in the functions of R&amp;D, whether in the continued    emphasis on the local process of innovation, or in developing organizational    capital that allows them to integrate the technological activities of dispersed    units. The increasing geographic dispersion of strategic assets drives the capacity    of foreign subsidiaries, both with regard to horizontal growth - of communication    across national borders - and in a vertical direction - one of systematic use    of the technological expertise of the organization's several bases. Therefore,    the object of research has increasingly moved away from the strategic benefits    of using the emerging resources of a particular foreign subsidiary towards the    advantages associated with continuous integration... IT has enabled subsidiaries    to integrate in the central laboratories of the TNCs, providing them with conditions    to develop and participate in other technological activities besides the traditional    roles of adapting to processes and products" (Gomes, 2003: 268)</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The extensive literature    on the internationalization of R&amp;D, which points to the existence of several    corporate strategies for scientific and technological development in several    regions, shows the existence of a set of shared values across all the different    influence levels of these sectors. Albert and Laberge (2007) indicate that technology    policy makers in Quebec, Canada, follow economy and innovation parameters created    in other centers, forging a situation for the international dissemination of    technological and scientific perspectives. The local sectors that do not share    the assumptions of the Innovation System and do not follow the procedures attached    to this design end up being neglected and do not benefit from decent working    conditions and employability (See also Gingras, 2002).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently,    in Brazil, these trends have meant that it is possible for the State to not    intervene decisively in science and technology and to copy models of international    institutions that prescribe formulas for the organizational arrangements of    scientific practices (Baumgarten, 2008). In other words, these authors indicate    that the innovative elites of the public sector are those who best embody the    established values of technological thinking on an international scale, arising    mainly from the concepts of innovation systems and local production arrangements.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Science and    Technology Policies in Brazil</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1950s, 60s    and 70s, scientific and technological development was formally on the political    agenda for Latin American countries, but this had little real effect in terms    of sustaining and consolidating effective national projects. According to Vessuri    (2008), modernization was a recurring collective aspiration and a key policymaking    idea for several Latin American countries. However, the research community was    unable to ensure a self-sustaining growth process.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the early 1990s,    notes Vessuri (2008), growth prospects for research groups in strategic sectors    were undermined due to a hesitating private sector and increasing foreign debt.    Until the 1970s, the international circulation of researchers had had an impact    specifically upon certain fields of knowledge. However, its scope was restricted    to certain economic sectors and had not yet extended to a more global coordination.    Latin America's academic elites were still very much under the sway of the State    apparatus, and science and technology policies displayed corporate behavior,    rather than a dynamic and effective ability to set an agenda (Vessuri, 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Several authors    have noted that there are still many economic and institutional challenges for    producing technology in Latin America today. Thomas (2006) sees a lack of synergy    between the technology and productive sectors and an inability to formulate    policy agendas for the field, as some aspects prevent the creation of opportunities    for fruitful activities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In recent years,    policymakers in Brazil and other Latin American countries have engaged in aims    such as tightening intellectual property regulations, building research networks    and obtaining public-private sector synergies in the field of technology. In    the case of Brazil, these trends have been consolidated over the last few decades    through recent developments in science and technology policies and local activities    by international groups. Lagging behind the developed economies, Brazil's technology    and innovation policymakers have sought to build a new environment for innovative    activities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The "national-development"    perspective was a key aspect of the trajectory of the State's S&amp;T sector    from the 1950s and throughout the military period, when the dominant paradigm    for a political project was the prospect of Brazil becoming a regional power,    with the State as the crucial agent for all major scientific and technological    projects, since the national bourgeoisie was not seen as an&nbsp;effective partner.    S&amp;T partnerships were primarily intra-state with no significant connection    to the local or international private sector (Baumgarten, 2008). Science and    technology policy has traditionally been headed by the research community, located    in public universities and state research centers. Even today, groups located    in key positions in this community make the main decisions for science and technology    policies in Brazil. According to Dagnino (2007), the control that the research    community exerted over national science and technology policy was very often    related to corporative interests aiming to promote the self-preservation of    certain groups and disciplines. To a certain extent, this strong presence of    the research community in science and technology policymaking inhibited the    participation of agents from the productive sectors. This development model    was not seen as successful in terms of providing favorable conditions for companies    to introduce technological innovation practices, so Brazil's economic and technological    elites sought to address the situation by proposing institutional and cultural    changes.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More recently,    Brazil's scientific output - particularly from its public universities - has    done better in terms of the impact of its publications worldwide. But growing    scientific productivity has not boosted interaction with the productive sector    (Matias-Pereira and Kruglianskas, 2005; Cassiolato and Lastres, 2000).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the State's    fiscal crises from the 1980s onwards and new emerging forms of research funding    and international trends in recent decades, Brazil's technology sector has steadily    become more autonomous compared to the scientific and academic sectors. During    President Lula's first term of office, an Industrial, Technological and Trade    policy (PITCE) was introduced, and the Law of Innovation was passed (Law 10973/04).    These efforts were necessary, but not sufficient in terms of altering innovation    culture in Brazil. Following in the footsteps of developed economies, a broad    range of initiatives was required, with a new social deal for technology to    include companies that historically had not invested in this field, universities    resistant to market practices and the public bureaucracy. A new elite of policymakers    has recently emerged in research institutes and development agencies, aiming    to assess the science and technology sector and create specific arrangements    for its funding and evaluation (Andrade and Moreira Jr., 2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One aspect of these    changes refers to the need to adopt an innovation agenda, which was not an important    part of science and technology policy until the 1990s. Technological innovation    activities started with the formulation of integrated policies covering productive    sectors, government, and technological research centers. In recent decades,    there has been a major redefinition of these institutions in an attempt to internalize    such practices in Brazil (Arbix, 2007).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Plonsky    (2005), since the 1990s, Brazilian society has tried to build a more effective    institutional background for innovation policies. The production of The White    Book (<i>Livro Branco</i>) by the S&amp;T Ministry, the formulation of the Industrial,    Technological and Foreign Trade Policy (PITCE) and the Law of Innovation during    Lula's office were important but insufficient efforts to alter the lack of innovation    culture in Brazil (See also Baumgarten, 2008). The creation of sector-level    research funding (<i>Fundos Setoriais</i>), the formulation of the Law of Innovation    and the growing importance of business incubators with the consolidation of    technology parks, all point to the tendency to integrate technological innovation    experiences and practices (Lemos, 2000). These policies have led to key articulations    and higher productivity, but also significant asymmetries across different research    areas, more specifically between basic research and leading-edge technology.    An analysis by Pacheco (2007) clearly points to this:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the technological      area, setting up sector-level funds was a new way of funding research in different      areas by using non-budgetary funds. Although it involved important benefits      for different areas, this initiative led to a significant division as it prioritized      high-tech sectors and consequently withdrew funding from scientific research      as such (Pacheco, 2007: 213).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the most    salient results of this policy was to make innovation a separate and self-referential    subject in relation to scientific development. Based on Baumgarten's analysis,    the distinction between science and technology interests is particularly clear    when</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(...) around      70% of funds are allocated to technological development, and, given Brazil's      current low capacity to demand technology resources, this creates an imbalance      since supply far exceeds the level justified by demand (...) (Baumgarten,      2008: 217).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This imbalance    points to a situation that is increasingly visible in S&amp;T policies, namely    the trend toward separating these two fields. Several budgetary funds now tend    to be allocated to fields that are clearly performing well in technological    terms, to the detriment of science education and research.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another sign of    modifications to the concept of technological research and development can be    seen in university research funding. Certain universities have recently introduced    incentives for students to develop grant-aided projects that explicitly pursue    technological innovation. This means that funds for science student grants from    Brazil's federal research agency (CNPq) are being overseen by academics using    them to develop projects in companies. The criteria of technological feasibility    and synergy with business are thus becoming increasingly significant when allocating    funds, providing grants or educating qualified staff. Science and technology    do coexist, of course, but parameters for technical feasibility and assessment    are being set by academic elites clearly attuned to leading-edge technology.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the 1990s    onwards, new innovation-fostering experiences started to call for industries    to engage with this agenda. But partnerships must be arranged and experiences    exchanged across a very diverse range of industries. Relations between business    and state-controlled research centers pose complicated systemic problems for    policymakers (Veronese, 2006).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another clear sign    of the increasing internationalization of scientific research can be seen in    the consolidation of innovation legislation in Brazil. The Law of Technological    Innovation (Federal law number 10.973/2004) "provides incentives for innovation    and research in science and technology in industry", and creates an environment    in which business could be more involved in developing projects. The law suggests    more partnerships between business, universities and science and technology    institutes in order to lead innovation processes. This law, based on parameters    taken from the French experience, states a number of specific aims: creating    an environment for partnerships between universities, technological institutes    and companies; incentivizing the involvement of science and technology institutions    in the innovation process; and fostering innovation within companies. It also    enables firms to be more present in the public sphere by sharing public and    private infrastructure and human resources to drive technological research.    More controversially, it also regulates conditions for researchers at public    research institutions to develop technology projects, offering grants for innovation    and additional salaries, as well as allowing start-up technology firms. Funds    can be directly channeled towards firms developing innovative projects if they    can prove reciprocal benefits and results.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These new rules    for technological activity may subject the scientific agenda to business imperatives,    and the sectors responsible for producing scientific knowledge might not obtain    anything in return. All these demands and connections aim to respond to the    commercialization of scientific practice now under way internationally, which    has been affecting the course of the scientific and technological logic and    determining different approaches to these trends (Lamy and Shinn, 2006).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Organizational    Trends in Brazilian Public Research Institutes</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This section briefly    discusses the historical context since Brazil's first Public Research Institutes    (PRIs) were founded in the mid-19th century, showing five main periods or stages.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PRIs were founded    in response to social problems and reflected the utilitarian interests of science    in human health, agriculture and livestock rearing, and natural resources (Dagnino    and Novaes, 2004). In its early period, science had a close alliance with the    rural elites and local bureaucracy, supporting an economic model based on exporting    commodities. Different types of knowledge were produced for exporting commodities    to Europe. PRIs created under this dynamic fostered industrial development but    the enhanced technologies were isolated upgrades, since there was no demand    for linking technology with production. Note that Brazil at the time was still    almost entirely dependent on foreign technology in a colonialist context. This    period lasted from the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century through to    the 1920s, when the agrarian export model was undermined by the crisis, along    with the decline of oligarchic power in Brazil, thus opening a second period    through to the late 1950s, when core-development shifted to industrialization    and research institutes flourished by producing technology for local use. Technological    research institutes were given great importance in this period of growing demand    from civil engineering and construction, and from other entrepreneurs (Gitahy,    2001: 687). At this point, there were no fully developed connections across    scientific institutions; science policies were not connected and subordinated    to international capital (Baumgarten, 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third period,    coinciding with the military government from the 1960s until 1985, was the most    vigorous in terms of the local technological development that was supposed to    take Brazil to a higher level of industrialization (Dagnino and Novaes, 2004).    It was also a time of change (at least in rhetoric), in which Science and Technology    (S&amp;T) policy played a more strategic role. One example was the M&eacute;dici    government's first National Development Plan&nbsp;(locally known as I PND),    spanning 1972 to 1974, which sought to reduce the need to import technology.    Industrial competition came to be seen as not purely a matter of seeking economic    growth, but also of keeping up with the technology led by foreign companies    (Baumgarten, 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Geisel government    (1975-1979) produced the second National Development Plan (II PND), incorporating    guidelines from the previous plan. This time, the rhetoric actually materialized,    and the Geisel government's industrial policy emphasized basic electronics for    national security and defense (Baumgarten, 2008). In this third period, the    PRIs were much more prominent and concatenated, showing a clear relationship    between "bureaucracy and techno-science".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fourth period    was characterized by redemocratization in the 1980s, with economic and political    liberalization. Relations between research institutes and the State unraveled    because the science policies of the 1960s and 70s had been systematically based    on the authoritarian State (Baumgarten, 2008). The main point regarding this    period is that the local market was opened to foreign capital in the 1980s -    the period generally being referred to as the "lost decade". A neoliberal adjustment    of the economy coincided with the state being dismantled and a decline in local    production. Meanwhile, PRIs became "dysfunctional", since a market open to foreign    capital considerably reduced the demands that had traditionally been made of    the PRIs.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fifth and final    period in this historical trajectory of PRIs in Brazil spans from 1990 to the    present. Having previously served the demands of the economic elites, the new    purpose of these institutions was now to serve different actors such as transnational    enterprises, for instance, while recovering their dynamism and ability to redirect    priorities. There was a deep change in the role of the State. Fiscal restrictions    prevented the provision of resources for advanced technological research. In    this context, partnerships and other mechanisms were necessary to support innovation    projects (Salles Filho et al., 2000). The State's fiscal and policymaking capacity    was reduced with the onset of the information economy, which prompted PRIs to    readapt and affected different aspects, such as partnerships and funding from    non-governmental sources. Economic globalization and expanded market opportunities    required greater adaptation from PRIs to cope with new competitive conditions    in a flexible and highly competitive space.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given this new    situation, PRIs were forced to change tack. They had to diversify their sources    for research funding, attract extra-budgetary sources of funds and pursue financial    independence, which created a tendency to rebalance public goals and commercial    interests. All these requirements pointed to an increasing need to improve management    procedures and maximize results. From this point of view, these institutions    clearly had to meet demands and redefine their forms of producing science and    technology.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Materials and    Methods</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We shall now discuss    how this process took place in the case of the Technological Research Institute    (IPT), thus identifying the ways in which these trends influenced staff relations    and career arrangements involved in the production of technology. As we mentioned    in the Introduction, the Technological Research Institute is an illustrative    example of the internationalization of new scientific practices in the IPPs    in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This case study    was conducted according to the following strategies:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a) Searching for    other studies that focused specifically on the IPT. These materials provided    good information on the Institute's history and its working conditions over    time (Gitahy, 2001; Gusm&atilde;o, 1991; Mello, 2000; Salles-Filho et al., 2000).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">b) Collecting internal    publications, such as development plans, books and some press releases. We collected    some of these materials by searching the Institute's website, while others were    found in the local library to which we had access.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">c) Conducting structured    interviews with researchers. In these interviews, we focused mainly on their    perceptions regarding new working conditions that have been routinized in the    Institute over recent years, especially after the Law of Innovation. Interviewing    eight researchers was enough to shed some light on these new trends and their    perceptions of them. We interviewed a group of senior researchers involved in    the IPT's internal union (ASSIPT) who had information on work conditions, and    were able to compare the current situation with established practices.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After collecting    these different materials for our case study, we put together a brief history    of the Institute over the decades. Then, we analyzed the new trends and their    impacts using the perceptions collected in the interviews.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Technological    Research Institute (IPT) in Five Phases</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Technological    Research Institute (IPT/USP) is a public institution pursuing technological    research and innovation. Over recent decades, these organizational trends have    been the object of research, and they provide an interesting example to discuss    the internationalization of scientific knowledge and transformations in technological    work. The institutional trajectory of the IPT and the context of economic and    social transformation over time prompted us to present the four phases in our    research, as described below.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Phase one: laboratory</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the IPT's first    institutional phase - from 1870 through the early 1920s - , it was merely a    laboratory attached to the university; a means of responding to the demands    of urban progress (Gitahy, 2001). It was initially connected to the Material    Resistance Bureau (locally denominated as "GRM") for the sole purpose of quality    assurance in industry. In the 1920s, as the demand for technology increased,    the GRM was replaced by a new body reflecting society's new paradigms: the Material    Testing Laboratory (known as "LEM").</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In terms of the    professional activity of researchers and specialists, this period involved expanding    roles and responsibilities. Full-time research positions were introduced, as    well as partnerships with companies for specific activities. Fees were charged    for services, and the first more systematic initiatives were taken to foster    researcher specialization (Salles-Filho et al., 2000).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Phase two: founding    the IPT</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Phase 2 of the    IPT's institutional history starts with its configuration as an independent    body. In 1934, some months before the University of S&atilde;o Paulo (USP) was    founded, the LEM became the Technological Research Institute (IPT). It took    the legal form of an "autarchy", with its own assets and premises, based in    the city of S&atilde;o Paulo, but retaining ties with the Polytechnic School    (USP). There was much more involvement by private companies, which led to new    areas of technical activity, such as metrology and chemistry (Salles Filho et    al., 2000). In this period, there was major growth in civil engineering and    construction, which leveraged many of the projects developed by the IPT in the    1930s and 40s, and became its benchmark in the following decades.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kawamura (1981)    shows that the IPT in this period became one of the main institutions boosting    the status of professional engineers in Brazil, inasmuch as it routinized technical    activities that had previously been dispersed and under-regulated. The IPT intervened    between technical knowledge that was still poorly regulated by professional    and scientific associations and an industrial system still poorly concatenated    and heavily dependent on public funds. Engineers could work at the IPT without    a highly skilled professional system, as could engineer-entrepreneurs in need    of more consistent academic knowledge.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Phase three:    development ideology and the military regime</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third phase    corresponds to the institutional consolidation of the main activities (in this    case, the construction industry) and the corresponding crisis in emerging fields,    and lasted from the late 1940s until 1970. During this period, there were two    particularly significant processes in Brazil: the 1950s, with an economic boom    anchored by a development ideology; and the second period with the first National    Development Plan (I PND) introduced by the military regime (Baumgarten, 2008).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This historical    context is important because it directly affected the IPT. From the 1940s onwards,    the Institute expanded its technological capabilities to new areas of activity    beyond civil engineering and construction, and responded to the interests of    a more vigorous and ideologically defined national bourgeoisie. Major projects    such as S&atilde;o Paulo's new subway system and the <i>Imigrantes</i> highway    (between the city of S&atilde;o Paulo and the coast) were very important for    the Institute during the military regime, and it was closely involved with these    public construction projects that helped improve its image.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the aftermath    of the 1973 oil crisis, a stagnant economy and increasing inflation posed considerable    problems for public programs. There was a growing demand for alternative technologies,    which gave rise to the 1975 ethanol program. The IPT tried to reorient and assimilate    these new technological demands and incorporate related values, but this aim    failed to materialize in the medium term (Salles Filho et al., 2000).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both private companies    and public institutes were awarded contracts and offered incentives, allowing    them to retain previously consolidated paradigms and reducing the need to pursue    new science and technology. Even today, this is reflected in the Brazilian industry's    scant appetite for agreements involving cooperation and investment in new scientific    and technological trajectories.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Phase four:    Business corporation</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1971, the state    government's Science and Technology Program (PROCET) launched a discussion on    science and technology entrepreneurship. From this perspective, research institutes    would have to upgrade institutional mechanisms used to obtain funds and use    them flexibly and autonomously. This whole discussion culminated in the legal    format of the IPT being altered in 1976, when its name was changed to reflect    its new status as a limited liability business corporation (IPT S.A.), which    meant it could organize its activities independently and concentrate on obtaining    its own funds and resources. Accordingly, the IPT went on to develop relations    with the market in a more organized and efficient manner, free from bureaucratic    procedures that could hinder procurement of services or contracts, thus streamlining    its activity (Salles Filho et al., 2000). Salles Filho (2000) notes that this    paradigm shift was not emulated by other PRIs, which gave the IPT great leeway    in terms of projects attracting investment capital, as it became a public "company"    or "enterprise".</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1980s, like    most Brazilian PRIs, the IPT went through a period of crisis as Brazil opened    its markets to international capital and the simultaneous process of globalization.    Many researchers left the IPT as professional prospects waned and competitive    salaries in the market became more attractive to them. Research teams that had    been consolidating since the 1970s lost several members and their technological    vigor diminished (Gusm&atilde;o, 1991).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the 1990s    onwards, technological knowledge was seen as an important competitive element,    and the IPT's science and technology policies enabled it to arrange new partnerships    with firms that could not afford their own R&amp;D department (Salles Filho    et al., 2000; Castro, 2009).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Phase five (1990s):    new trends</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baumgarten (2008)    notes that in 2000, S&amp;T policy in Brazil was not immune to internationally    prevailing trends towards commoditizing knowledge and privatizing research priorities,    a trend that was also present in research carried out at the IPT. In the last    quarter of the previous century, the IPT managed R&amp;D projects for a number    of private and public enterprises and charted a new pattern of scientific and    technical activity. In this period, the tone was set for the privatization of    all economic activity as part of the trend towards globalization, and there    were a series of cuts in the IPT's budgets.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1995, to name    one example of the IPT's technology partnerships with local firms, agreements    to expand technological capacity and production processes were made with companies    producing basic materials, such as steelmaker National Steel Company (Brazilian)    and Brazilian Metals and Mining Company.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The IPT's first      partnership agreement under FAPESP's Technological Innovation program was      with steelmaker <i>Cia Sider&uacute;rgica Nacional</i>... making medium-efficiency      electric steel used for making electric motors (...). The IPT developed an      alternate process for making ferroniobium for the <i>Cia Brasileira de Metalurgia      e Minera&ccedil;&atilde;o (</i>...) (REVISTA IPT - Research &amp; Technology,      2009: 69).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These initiatives    demonstrated closer connections between the IPT, development agencies and Brazilian    firms, with more effective programs for innovation. During this period, special    attention was given to the Institute's relations with the external environment,    steering activities and priorities for different sectors. In the mid-1990s,    institutional reorganization gave rise to a business-unit structure at the Institute,    and the application of a concept central to business management known as "strategic    support units" (locally referred to by the acronym AES).</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Strategic support      units do not pose a new formal structure, but rather a new way of organizing      research and services, enabling a more flexible departmentalized structure;      incentivizing networked matrix system arrangements, which may consist of researchers      from a single unit or from different units (Salles Filho et al., 2000: 266).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given its concern    with financial dependence on the State, the IPT used this support-unit structure    to introduce a new approach to market interests and the State, thus gaining    more autonomy in terms of funding and financial management (Salles Filho et    al., 2000). As a business corporation, the IPT developed mechanisms to optimize    internal management and ensure its institutional autonomy. Support units were    critical at this point because they enabled the IPT to make strategic alliances    with both public and private companies, thus reducing dependence and legitimizing    its initiatives.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, in the    1990s, the Institute diversified into R&amp;D in new sectors of science beyond    civil engineering and construction, including biomedical research on biodegradable    plastics and quality control checks for gas stations in the state of S&atilde;o    Paulo to ensure compliance with National Petroleum Agency (ANP) requirements.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the second half    of the 1990s, the proportions of budget and non-budget sources of funds were    reversed and prospecting more external business became crucial to sustainability    (Salles Filho&nbsp;et al., 2000). From 1995 through 1998, non-budgetary sources    of funds jumped from 26% to 50%, while the state-government budget's contribution    fell significantly from 74% to 50%.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Outside projects      in the form of contracts and agreements signed by the Institute during the      period accounted for a larger share of revenue, reflecting the IPT's post-1995      policy of encouraging new partnerships and funding arrangements (Salles Filho      et al., 2000: 273).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public and private    companies signed more contracts with the Institute, making it increasingly dependent    on earning revenue on services demanded by external agents. External projects    were therefore increasingly specified and detailed, whereas internal projects    such as training programs were subject to less interference from higher instances.    This aspect matched the important role of external sources of funding in this    new institutional configuration.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within this context    of institutional shifts and reorganization of technological activities that    the Institute underwent throughout the 2000s, the changes in work conditions    became an even more relevant issue. This question will be dealt with in the    next section.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Conditions and    Careers for Technology Researches in the Recent Setting</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the early 2000s,    many authors emphasized that innovation policies could lead to new conditions    in technological development. There was a wide range of perspectives that pointed    to the fact that the coming of the knowledge society would increase science    production across different levels: national, regional and local. Lemos (2000)    stated that globalization, linked to new markets and competitive standards,    would rebuild technological production. For other authors, like Cassiolato and    Lastres (2000), Brazilian policy makers were implementing policies that would    enable our science institutions to redefine their positions on an international    scale. There was an optimistic perception of our capacity to internalize such    tendencies and establish new parameters of technological innovation in the medium-term.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our case study    shows that this picture is not so clear. It is hard to determine whether these    conditions for technological work might lead to an improvement in scientific    institutions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, official    research funding agencies have enabled academic researchers to be involved in    companies and research institutes through specific arrangements or by providing    grants. The emergence of this kind of program demands closer relations between    university research and the demands of business, based on a new scientific-technical    deal that has been made by these different sectors. One of the central issues    in this debate is the emergence of technological entrepreneurship. The introduction    of the Law of Technological Innovation in 2004 and incentives for development    agencies to enable academics to work for companies means that interfacing between    research and production is high on the current agenda.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Sociology of    Science has recently discussed the perspective of "antidifferentialism", in    which scientific research and economic production in the globalized world have    become so intertwined that their frameworks are now inseparable. Lamy and Shinn    (2006) have discussed the response from French scientists and specialists when    research was placed on a commercial basis by a new Technology Innovation Law.    They noted a trend for scientist-entrepreneurs to join scientific practices    with market ones in order to preserve the specific features of both fields.    They describe researcher-entrepreneurs as showing both academic and business    behaviors, so researchers and specialists need to adapt their interests to scientific    and economic terms.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This discussion    is interesting, since it calls into question the "antidifferentialist" thesis,    while emphasizing the contingency of scientific behavior. Scientist-entrepreneurs    often</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(...) alternate      [between] an entrepreneurial system and an academic regime. Pointing to the      existence of this mode of sequential coordination confirms the possibility      of a non-pathological preservation of differences between science and the      market (Lamy and Shinn, 2006: 49).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is not simply    a question of showing that specialists and researchers incorporate commercial    logic, note these authors. Certain fields are open to business investment so    that new practices and interests coexist, taking the form of specific short-term    measures, but this does not mean a total acceptance of market rules.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How do these issues    present themselves to the IPT at present? It is interesting that specialists    and researchers do not have clear positions on the implications of adhering    to new forms of relationship between researchers and business. Despite the growing    agenda of interpenetration between entrepreneurs and specialists, IPT professionals    do not clearly say how they are involved in these forms of technical-scientific    practice.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As part of this    context in which the IPT started to alter its institutional logic and reorganize    technological practices in the 1990s, the issue of researchers' conditions and    careers came to the fore. Many researchers left the IPT in the 1990s and staff    numbers fell from approximately 3,000 in the 1980s to 1,800 (Mello, 2000). From    1994 to 1998, there was a significant drop of around 14% in the number of researchers    and graduate assistants. This major loss in terms of scientific and technological    leadership was not repaired in subsequent years.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 2000 onwards,    this situation became more critical. This diagnosis is clearly shown in the    2002 Master Plan, which notes the situation in which</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IPT units and      coordinating bodies unanimously agree that the institute requires a policy      on renovation and recycling for its workforce. Year after year, the Institute      has been losing skilled technical and administrative personnel due to the      lack of prospects in terms of salaries and careers, and to the State's contradictory      policies. Therefore, the executive board is committed to preserving and renovating      its critical mass, as well as readjusting it to the reality of the market      (Plano Diretor, 2002: 17).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Inability to tackle    market competition is seen as a central aspect of this condition, and the Institute    must find ways of attracting staff for technology work.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One major problem    noted by the institution concerns the training and refresher programs for its    researchers. The 2002 Master Plan emphasized this aspect as a priority to be    addressed:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Firstly, one      item appeared in all unit assessments: <b>human resources</b>. Salaries are      below levels prevailing in the market, so there is a lack of career prospects      within the institution, procedures are slow and it is not hiring, so the IPT      has been struggling to retain technical staff at the level of excellence expected      by its clients. This leads to concern for the future of the institution, which      is heavily dependent on the technical capabilities of its staff. This is perhaps      the most critical aspect the IPT is facing (IPT, 2002: 5, emphasis in the      original).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the new century    begins, there is a need for new initiatives related to hiring and training through    competitive examinations and postgraduate programs to be developed within the    Institute. One way of tackling this issue is through programs with graduate    students and visiting researchers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another problematic    aspect for sustainability is that the absence of a skilled marketing sector    able to boost the visibility of its services diminishes the Institute's presence    for its target segment of small and medium firms (IPT, 2002). According to the    researchers interviewed, there are still no regulatory principles for this activity    within the Institute. As of yet, there is no data showing use of the technological    innovation legislation to bring technology projects into the Institute, and    neither have researchers applied for leave of absence to set up firms (Silva,    2009). One of the specialists interviewed said there is still a great sense    of insecurity regarding technological entrepreneurship at several research institutions:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an interview      with an ITA (Technological Institute of Aeronautics) professor at a technology      park, one of the questions was precisely on the Innovation Law, and he said      that the law made him very insecure... he had been invited to work for a company      and he wanted to do that, but when discussing this within the ITA, he felt      that if he took leave, there might no longer be a place for him when he came      back... so he talked about it, but did not feel secure... (Specialist 1).<a name="top1"></a><a href="#back1"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Law of Technological    Innovation is precisely meant to enable these forms of negotiation between research    institutions, researchers and companies and to provide regulations for these    exchanges. However, a culture has not yet taken root for more agents to be able    to adjust their future commitments and predict their modes of scientific work.    In other countries, these practices are more deeply rooted and routine, but    in Brazil, institutions and researchers do not yet share the same parameters.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(...) This is      because it's a different culture... this support for innovation comes primarily      from capitalist countries, the US and Korea.... Take the case of the US, where      it is a natural part of academic life; Silicon Valley was nothing more than      what they call a spin-off... Researchers automatically go to these companies      and it's no wonder that 96% of patents are generated in the private sector      by incorporating this critical mass... In Brazil this [kind of thing] is not      seen as being so natural... Until a while ago, if a researcher at the IPT      left to do research related to what he was doing here at the IPT, but for      a business, this could constitute grounds for dismissal... (Specialist 2).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the introduction    of the Innovation Law, this is no longer a problem, because there is now a legal    basis for spin-offs between institutes and companies, with clear rules for both    sides. But this issue still has controversial aspects. Researchers still feel    insecure about joining in with such new forms of work. If a researcher leaves    the Institute temporarily to work on a specific project for a company, there    is no alternate assessment within the Institute to recognize this external activity.    According to one of the researchers, there is a need for clearer rules regarding    external and internal activities:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I allow the researcher      to go to such and such a company... but I continue to require things from      their unit... either you create a structure that allows you to do this, or      it all just amounts to babble (Specialist 2).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This type of statement    shows a situation of uncertainty and opposition between the institutional logic    and patterns of knowledge transfer. There are still doubts within the Institute    regarding whether or not it is feasible for agents to effectively fulfill professional    requirements on the one hand, and stay updated in relation to the new rules    on innovative activities on the other. These new rules are seen as necessary    but at the same time, they change the reputational rules and forms of recognition    among scientists and specialists. Alliances with business sectors may finally    break down internal accords between researchers, setting new parameters for    scientific competitiveness. In the words of one of the researchers concerned    with these changing rules, they destabilize the beliefs involved in scientific    activity.</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The IPT (a PRI)      uses a&ccedil;a&iacute; fruit to make.... a nano-particle that may be put      into cosmetics... is it right for the IPT to be doing this just for Natura?...And      if it is now right, should I see this as something likely to happen?... hence      this malaise caused by a culture previous to a legal architecture seen as      correct, objective, and now acceptable.... so that's it... These basically      philosophical issues permeate these laws... when a decision is made that's      it... no more. Professional embarrassment in relation to peers... legislation      allows this! (Specialist 3).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The introduction    of these new forms of scientific and technological activity connecting institutes    with the external environment will redefine practices and rules that can no    longer handle more efficient connections. Whitley (2000) notes that scientific    institutions that do not prepare their staff for these new forms of collective    work will not be able to place themselves in a reputational structure that is    more flexible and linked to the hegemonic logic of scientific production. The    IPT must build a more flexible normative framework to handle these situations    enabled by the Law of Technological Innovation. Further adhesion becomes even    more complex in light of the low level of concern among its researchers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to help    manage new investments, in July 2008 the IPT set up its Modernization Process    Management Cell with the mission of defining more precise strategies for decision-making    (<i>REVISTA IPT - Research &amp; Technology,</i> 2009). The proposal is to make    internal processes leaner with more streamlined decision-making.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Researchers show    great concern for these practices and major infrastructure investments. Trends    toward reformulated rules for research are not being matched by a greater involvement    of skilled researchers acting in public institutions. Asked about the direction    of these more recent internal rules, another researcher replied:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What I see is      that this process of purchasing equipment did not arise from a strategic plan      devised by the institution... it was not a plan that involved its staff....      researchers did not contribute their opinions... they just talked about equipment...      we could say that this investment was not based on a strategic plan agreed      with the Institute's management... (Specialist 3).</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">According to Whitley    (2000), the organizational conditions for researchers to become reputational    agents able to set a scientific agenda for the institution have been eroding    in recent times. The institutional environment created in this scenario does    not create good conditions for employees to take part in these strategic plans.    In interviews, researchers point out that new legislation on scientific and    technological research and the large investment of funds in recent years has    not been accompanied by innovative forms of discussing professional needs or    negotiation around shared strategies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some work conditions    still remain, keeping the researchers apart from the Institute's decision-making    process. This organizational expansion of science and technology research and    the Institute's participation in broader inter-sector partnerships is not happening    concurrently with wider rules for internal dialogue and participation by different    actors. Some groups of researchers are still not very aware of these management    rules and cannot understand or keep up with technological production taking    on more bureaucratic forms. According to Moreira et al. (2007), results provided    by this new legal framework regarding innovation are still uncertain. Research    institutes, universities and governments so far have not created a stable environment    in which to implement continuous incentives, especially in the case of the Law    of Innovation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the main    aspects mentioned in the interviews is that the creation of elaborate institutional    management mechanisms has raised the visibility of the more business-like management    initiatives. Whether or not these trends are directly affecting conditions for    technological work is not so clear. For some researchers, there is still concern    about the participation of the different sectors in devising these strategies:</font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you create      a tremendous structure in the IPT, of infrastructure for nanotechnology, with      extremely high capital investment... you're creating what they call an innovation      environment... you create an environment that brings in critical mass via      competitive procedures for the IPT, and through BNDES investment, you are      making...following a predetermined route, so I think that even we, who have      been here at the IPT for longer, need to be better informed on this qualitative      change that has occurred, if only to better understand what is happening and      be able to gauge what we will be doing as a result... this ends up as very      simplistic reasoning..."Ah!&nbsp;look... they're just finding money for equipment      but not for salaries"... okay, that's what it looks like at first sight...but      150 million's worth of equipment has its own logic, which permeates...the      logic of creating an innovation environment, it has a logic... subtract here,      add there...So you have to be careful with this, you have to see what this      investment has actually brought to the table, this law and this innovation      environment, in terms of technology transfer and response to the demands of      society... (Specialist 4)</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The new reality    of internationalized scientific research points to the construction of more    sophisticated and flexible managerial frameworks, but also poses problems for    the technological conditions of work. The internalization of some new procedures    within these organizations still produces tensions that cannot be overcome by    management measures. The reputational positions involved in these struggles    show that such organizations are still unable to stabilize their options.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These groups tend    to redefine their positions, both as professional groups and as reputational    agents aiming to rebuild this field. For Whitley (2000), it is combining new    management patterns with established status conditions that makes these disputes    even harder to coordinate. In this sense, science institutions tend to impose    some international conditions that reorganize ancient work practices and organizations    worldwide.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this case, science    and technology policies may be conceived not just as an institutional investment,    but rather as a specific way of redistributing reputations and skills. such    tendencies are linked to a widespread change in research assessment that has    taken place throughout latin america. the ipt constitutes a good case for observing    these new intellectual regimes emanating from international tendencies that    are taking over in many emergent countries.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>FINAL REMARKS</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Technological internationalization,    the integration of the innovation system, development of technology assessment    methodologies and the strengthening of scientific management in the academies    and scientific research institutions, along with new forms of financing, all    attest to the fact that there is a new social framework for coordinating and    managing the network of innovative activities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The groups that    lead science and technology seek to create conditions for a specific framework    for technical interests, and constitute an elite on a global scale that has    become autonomous in relation to established criteria of legitimacy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Latin American    countries in the 1950s and 60s were not able to keep up with the great scientific    and technological boost in the central countries that had been stimulated by    the tensions of the Cold War and the space race. At that time, the production    of knowledge was more localized and less easily shared, which derailed effective    interactions between research centers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During the globalization    era, there occurred an increased circulation of knowledge, and the possibility    for greater participation of developing countries in the core of science. However,    the neoliberal agenda prevented the allocation of necessary resources, the institutions    of scientific research stagnated, and the agenda of different countries could    not keep up with the direction of new forms of knowledge production on a worldwide    scale.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From the 1990s,    research institutions in Brazil internalized certain organizational forms that    enabled them to place themselves in the international agenda as reputational    agents. The IPT case demonstrates how Brazilian IPPs were encouraged by an international    agenda to modify their operational logic, incorporating new hiring services    and forms of fundraising.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The parameters    of S&amp;T budget and evaluation set by international organizations are giving    rise to new performance patterns for scientific organizations. Institutions    of scientific research have aligned their interests with hegemonic devices and    withdrawn the participation of agents not able to make explicit the new formulas    for recognition of the scientific field.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This paper defends    the need for social scientists to work within the perspective of understanding    scientific change as the result of political connections that are beyond the    traditional spaces of research practice, and that operate complex networks of    institutions and agents that have become increasingly significant and impermeable.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">AG&Ecirc;NCIA BRASILEIRA    DE DESENVOLVIMENTO INDUSTRIAL.

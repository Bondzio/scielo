Abstract: We comparatively analyze Brazilian literature in the 1990s and in the 2010s, stressing the ways we can distinguish their narratives of suffering. We arrange these narratives in two groups: suffering through an excess of unproductive experiences of determination and suffering through a lack of productive experiences of indetermination, thus translating the dialectics between truth and reality from Lacanian psychoanalysis. We propose a model based on transformative series, taking into account the destinies of trauma associated with the military-civil dictatorship and the return of social violence in the 2010s.

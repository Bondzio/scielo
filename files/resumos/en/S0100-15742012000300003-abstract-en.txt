Based on discourse theory I analyze the notion of democracy, starting from its relations with representation within a space of non-fixed identities and post-foundational policies. I advocate that all representation entails mutual constitution between representer and represented, within which pure transparency is impossible. In a democracy, one cannot escape representation, but it is possible to integrate analysis of representation into a radical contingency. I compare this conclusion with current curriculum policies for compulsory education in Brazil. I contend that despite its not being possible to reach a homogeneous conclusion as to democracy in curriculum policies, the contingencies in policies continue to be masked, and policy is oriented by the attempt to reduce contextual translations, thus minimizing democratic possibilities.

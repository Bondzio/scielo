Abstract This article analyzes the discursive strategies of Benedita da Silva and Celso Pitta&#8217;s campaigns in the municipalities of Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo, in both the 1992 and 1996 elections. This paper presents a reflection on the influence that color and/or racial identity of candidates have in defining the discursive strategies of black politicians and their opponents in political campaigns. The research drew on the content analysis and discourse of a comprehensive database consisting of advertisements of the HGPE, news coverage, documents, candidates&#8217; statements and their marketing consultants, as expressed in their biographies, memoirs and interviews. The paper further investigates what kind of marketing strategies are employed to manage the challenges of adjusting black candidate's public image in order to meet the aspirations of the voters in Brazilian society.

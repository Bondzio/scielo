Abstract In this paper, we present research in the social studies of science that use the science, technology and gender (STG) approach. The intersection of social studies of science with feminist theory and gender studies has produced this interdisciplinary field. An important corpus of work in this line has been conducted in Spain. This paper describes some of the studies of our research team in the past ten years in Spain. They have focused on case studies involving various biomedical technologies, and others in which bodies play a central role in establishing alliances, resistances or in questioning the regulatory framework in which bodies and technologies have been embedded.

In this article I approach how were observed and represented Toba women by the Anglican missionaries from the South American Missionary Society (SAMS) during their work at Misi√≥n El toba, on the West-Center Chaco, Formosa province (Argentina). I analyze too some activities promoted by the mission back in the 1930's and 1940's which seemed to generate cultural changes on the roles, identities and on women and man spaces. We'll also see the participation and the resistances of women to these imposed changes by the missionary work.

Abstract: This paper aims to show the results of a qualitative empirical research that addresses the gender relations and the domestic arrangements of households formed bycouples who work outside home from Great Concepci√≥n, Chile. Biographical aspects, professional expectations and labour development are analysed against theoretical-contextual elements throughout the study, in order to characterise the domestic dynamics and routines displayed among family members. From the accounts, it is possible to identify some findings that allow sustaining the persistency of elements ascribed to the traditional-patriarchal model of domestic-role distribution, as well as some changes in the practices, linked to female and male labour trajectories transformations.

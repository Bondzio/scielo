ABSTRACT This article intends to reflect on some relationships that (not) occurred between Florestan Fernandes and Claude Lévi-Strauss. To do this, we start with the well-known aban-donment of Florestan in relation to his studies on ethnology, trying to ask why such a fact would have occurred. One of the hypotheses is that Florestan would have come very close to the theory of the alliance in his A função social da guerra na sociedade Tupinambá , but that for some reasons obliterated in his reading of Lévi-Strauss led to a return to a function-alist theory already worn out to explain the indigenous war.

Abstract This work brings out the metropolitan context of homicides in Bras√≠lia, in 2010, specifically the town of Aguas Lindas de Goias. The paper highlights some features of the Brasilia metropolitan area, that interfaces with the structure and organization of public security, the deficit of health care activities in the municipality and also the dynamics of homicides. The research work was carried out on secondary socioeconomic data and semi-structured interviews with the actors involved with development of public safety and welfare programmes and policies. The results indicate to the socio-spatial segregation and social exclusion as the core features of the process of metropolization of the Brasilia. The high level of economic dependence and social interaction, between Aguas Lindas de Goias and Brasilia, is demonstrated throughout the offering of vacancies within the Brasilia's labor market and basic health services. In this context, and considering the high rate of homicides in the town, the paper indicates the need for cooperative policies between the different level of government involved (federal, state and municipalities) in economic and social sectors and public safety policies.

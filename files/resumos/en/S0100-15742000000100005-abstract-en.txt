This study on the first years of activity of the Society of Homes for Disabled Children bases itself in the exploration of the archives of the institution, recently renamed the Foundation D. Pedro IV. It was oriented by philanthropy, following the tendencies manifested by the hegemonic European classes especially in France and headed by the ex-Emperor of Brazil who had returned to Lisbon after the defeat of the Absolutists. The Homes for Disabled Children had their own physiognomy, different from the salles d'asile. Aiming to set a course consonant with the needs of Portuguese society, the promoters of the initiative started by creating a "school for teaching". Harvesting the first fruits of the experience, the Homes for Disabled Children movement began to spread throughout the country and diversify its interventions. Although intended for children of pre school age from poor or indigent families, these institutions became schools for learning first literacy, they also included manual and artistic educational activities in their curriculum as well as social education aimed at integrating their public. Despite this, the experience of early childhood education did not manage to disengage from the teaching tradition that characterized it.

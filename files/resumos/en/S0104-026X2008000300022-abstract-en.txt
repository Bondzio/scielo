In this article, I analyze the Brazil travel diary written by Belgium writer Mme. van Langendonck. Being of small nobility, she had an excellent education, what can be noticed by reading their texts full of clever observations about the country, the colonies, the emigrants, and the Brazilian government. She was a poet and writer, and published works such as Aubepines, poetry, in 1841, and Heures poétiques, poetry, in 1846. When she became widow, in 1857, decides to renounce to the comfortable life in her country and immigrates to Brazil, staying here for two years. Her adventure in the forests of Rio Grande do Sul originated a very vivid and colorful narrative that was published in Belgium in 1862 under the title Une colonie au Brésil.

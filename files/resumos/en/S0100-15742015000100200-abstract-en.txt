The notion of beauty in childhood and the practices of beautification directed at girls were analyzed based on the Barbie tips found in the book byFabiane Ariello (2007). Written and visual information were found in the doll's guidelines, which allowed assessment of the production of meaning regarding what it means to be beautiful and how to become beautiful. In those guidelines, we noticed the exchange between the behaviors of aesthetic care and the consumption of fashion goods and products, specifically in services related to appearance and artifacts/objects of the cosmetic industry. Such artifacts portray a standard of beauty that interferes with the construction of gender identity and the education of girls during childhood.

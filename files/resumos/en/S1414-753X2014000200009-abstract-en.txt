Commercial hunting was determinant in the disappearance of giant river otters along areas of historical occurrence in the Brazilian Amazonia. After approximately 30 years of absence, giant otters were spotted in the Amanã Lake in 2000, after the creation of the Amanã Reserve. Four years of field surveys were carried out to confirm the presence of giant river otters in the area and to assess local threats to the species. Information on the human impact on this otter population was compiled based on 83 interviews with residents. Areas of overlap used by both otters and humans resulted in negative interactions. The identified threats included: perception of otters as competitors for subsistence fisheries; conversion of natural areas into annual crops; removal of cubs to be raised as pets; and potential disease transmission from domestic animals. Mitigation and monitoring of these threats are paramount for the maintenance of giant river otters in the area.

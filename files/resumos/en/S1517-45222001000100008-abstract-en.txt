This article will be developed through an analogy with the old and new political paradigms (Offe, 1985), introducing the conceptualization of "old" and "new" social movements, trying to understand, from that stance, the birth and development of two rural argentine organizations, the "Unión de Cañeros Independientes de Tucumán" (UCIT)" and the "Movimiento de Mujeres Agropecuarias en Lucha" (MML), examining their organizational forms, their general make-up and their actions and narratives in the "collective protest action" scenario, exacerbated in recent years, which assumes the existence of a place for encounters, interaction and possible alliances. The choice of those organizations was due to the existence of several elements which allow us to approach the analysis prioritizing, on the one hand, the sedimentation and disruption of collective action and, on the other hand, the gender issue.

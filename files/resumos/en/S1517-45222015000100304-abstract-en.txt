Peripheral countries, also known as the Global South, while still maintaining traces of political and economic instability, are currently considered emerging countries, a derivation of the label of emerging markets received in early 1990s. Both Brazil and India fit to that description. These countries are part of a major mechanism that tends to change global political and economic dynamics. This text presents the main contributions of researchers who have been examining India's performance in the international context and, especially, its relationship with Brazil, within this same new world under construction. Emphasis is given to the simultaneity of positive and negative factors existing in both nations and to how these later intertwine in the design of a South-South relationship.

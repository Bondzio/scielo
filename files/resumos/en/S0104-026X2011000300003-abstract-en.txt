Spain held the EU Presidency for the first semester of 2010. During that period, the Spanish government made of gender equality policies one of its priorities. The Ministry of Equality was the main actor in this field, working in a transversal way with other bodies and institutions. Therefore, combating gender violence and human slavery for sexual exploitation at a European level became some of its main goals. This was also the case of the search for real gender equality, in contrast with the formal equality that we can find already in the first Treaties of the EEC. This article intends to assess the current situation, both in Europe and in Spain. The assessment will be carried out focusing mainly on the Work Plan 2006-2010 and on the last decisions as adopted by the EU. The aim is to check whether something has been achieved, whether any decision has been implemented, as well as to specify which measures should be taken, in order to fight against the inequalities that still exist.

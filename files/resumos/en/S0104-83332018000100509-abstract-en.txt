Abstract This article analyses images from the General Archive of the Nation (Argentina), focalizing on the photographs composition, and on the classification of materials. It wonders about the visual construction of a male emblematic national figure, the &#8220;gaucho&#8221; or &#8220;man of countryside&#8221;. It highlights two main features: the domestication of nature, shown as attribute of men, and the gendered division between the home/rancho and the greenfield. Besides that, the domestication of nature is shown as a whiten and civilizing work.

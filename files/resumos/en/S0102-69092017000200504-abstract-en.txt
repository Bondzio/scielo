The subject of this article is the relationship of affect between humans and non-human animals in a context of scientific practice: an animal house in a public research institution, which shelter mice, rats and hamsters for use in biomedical investigation. The main figures in this narrative are the animals and the technicians working in the animal house. Relating their experiences as caretakers with rodents, these latters say that caring well of animals is more than follow the protocols established on how to treat them, it&#8217;s necessary an affective way of perceive and touch them. The interest in well being of animal beyond the protocol and instrumental action, allow us to have a glimpse on the existence of intersubjective relations in a field where supposedly only have place objective and instrumental relations. My intention however is not so point to affects that pervade relationships between human and non human animals, but also explore the consequences to rethink animal ethics.

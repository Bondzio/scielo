Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Since the 1980s, the world has seen unprecedented    growth in economic regionalization, both through the creation of new agreements    for integration between countries and/or zones and through the strengthening    and expansion of existing blocs. One of the principal consequences of the predominance    of this organizational model is an expanding role for regional agreements in    international trade performance, which is the result of the net balance of positive    and negative effects of integration.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Regional integration has the positive effect    of creating a free trade area between signatory countries through the elimination    of import barriers<a name="vnota1"></a><a href="#nota1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and    allows competition between producers of a given good or service to take place    based on productive efficiency. Another common effect is increased trade between    member countries (intra-bloc trade expansion) that, when linked to the adoption    of protectionist trade policy for the bloc as a whole, reduces members’ exposure    to international competition. No less important is the increased bargaining    power of countries in the bloc with other integrated countries or zones to reduce    protectionism outside the bloc.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Regional trade blocs also produce negative effects.    The formation of an economic bloc reinforces protectionism in relation to countries    outside the bloc (extra-bloc) and generates what Viner (1950)<a name="vnota2"></a><a href="#nota2"><sup>2</sup></a>    calls trade diversion. The entry of a country into an existing trade bloc can    also mean the adoption of new protectionist measures by this country against    their old partners outside the bloc. Furthermore, when tariffs are eliminated,    the country parties to the agreement lose the tariff revenue.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The socio-economic implications of the growing    regionalization of global trade dynamics, and more specifically of the diversion/creation    of trade, have been the subject of great interest among international economists.    Their studies generally focus on (a) the performance of total trade between    countries; (b) the impacts on a particular country’s economic performance, usually    sectoral, after joining a free trade zone (intra-bloc effect); (c) the costs    and benefits of the regional integration processes; and (d) the effects of preferential    trade agreements on various countries’ trade performance. This paper fits into    the last group of studies.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The objective of this research is to identify    the component of trade that results specifically from bilateral relations and    to assess how the creation of a bloc affects trade relations between countries,    specifically focusing on trade between Brazil and other countries. Data used    in the analysis is based on international trade patterns in the agricultural    sector between 1984 and 1998. Although protectionism<a name="vnota3"></a><a href="#nota3"><sup>3</sup></a>    may occur in any economic sector, the principal distortions and the most complicated    international regulations are found in agricultural products markets, which    are generally more important to developing country economies<a name="vnota4"></a><a href="#nota4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2">It is assumed that the reorganization of global    economic space into blocs leads to the growth of trade between a bloc’s member    countries (intra-bloc) and the expansion of each member country’s domestic market    (which in effect becomes the size of the aggregate market of the member countries).    As a result, a smaller slice of the bloc’s market is available for countries    left out of the agreement.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">This paper is organized in five sections including    this introduction. The second section presents a brief discussion of the formation    and performance of economic blocs, as well as their impacts on intra and extra-bloc    relations. The third section describes the methodological approach used for    this study. The fourth presents and discusses study results, and the fifth and    final section presents closing remarks.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>2. The influence of regional integration on    international trade flows</b></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The importance of regional agreements to the    behavior of international trade is demonstrated by the fact that in 1998, the    members of the European Community (EC) together with the European Free Trade    Association (EFTA<a name="vnota5"></a><a href="#nota5"><sup>5</sup></a>), the    North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA<a name="vnota6"></a><a href="#nota6"><sup>6</sup></a>)    and Asia-Pacific<a name="vnota7"></a><a href="#nota7"><sup>7</sup></a>, a total    of only 31 countries, account for an impressive 83% of all global trade; and    that intra-bloc trade by members of these integrated areas has reached 67%,    36% and 51% of their respective levels of total international trade (Thorstensen,    1999).</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Grether and Olarreaga (1998) have also pointed    to great impact of bilateral trade agreements on international trade flows.    They found preferential trade represented around 42% of total transactions in    the global market in the 1993 to 1997 sub-period. Although there was only a    slight (2%) total growth in preferential trade in the 1988 to 1992 sub-period,    there were significant regional differences, as shown by regional bloc analyses,    and much greater growth in some cases. In the EU-15, preferential trade accounted    for around 72% of total trade over the entire period of their study, but was    greater in the agricultural sector than in the industrial goods sector. NAFTA    and MERCOSUL, the two largest trade blocs created at the end of the first sub-period,    behaved differently. In NAFTA, preferential trade increased significantly in    both sectors, while in MERCOSUL<a name="vnota8"></a><a href="#nota8"><sup>8</sup></a>,    the share of total trade represented by preferential trade remained relatively    stable in the largest economies but increased significantly in Paraguay and    Uruguay.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Freudenberg et al. (1998) obtained similar results    when they employed a gravity model to analyze the regionalization of international    trade in the 1967-94 period. Using intra-zone bilateral relative intensities    as an indicator, the study concluded that bilateral relative intensities of    trade between the countries in Western Europe zone (EU15 + EFTA) for the most    part increased: 75% for the period 1967-1994 and 81% in the sub-period 1980-1994.    In the Americas, 71% of the intra-zone relative intensities improved over the    entire study period, with considerable growth observed in the continent’s south.    Only in Asia-Oceania was there a clear weakening of regional linkages.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Using a similar analytic approach, Piani and    Kume (2000) also confirmed the importance of regional free trade agreements    for the creation of an extraordinary level of trade between member countries,    independently of whether the blocks are made up of developing or developed countries.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Carvalho (1999) analyzed the comparative performance    of Brazilian agriculture in intra-MERCOSUL trade using indicators such as revealed    competitiveness, the export coefficient, annual rate of trade expansion (imports    and exports), and the bloc’s share of international trade. The author concluded    that the bloc’s formation produced the expected effect in terms regional trade    expansion.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Analyzing a performance indicator for Brazilian    agricultural and agro-industrial products, Silva, Anefalos, and Reis F° (2001)    confirmed that the indicator’s behavior was strongly influenced by the signing    of regional trade agreements. From 1986 to 1998, when the creation of MERCOSUL    favored Brazilian exports to the MERCOSUL member countries, Brazilian exports    to NAFTA member countries decreased in approximately 60% of the product categories    analyzed. Over that same period, the performance of Brazilian exportation to    the European Union also deteriorated. The authors argue that this reduction    in Brazilian exports to the European Union was due primarily to tariff and non-tariff    barriers created by the European bloc rather than from growth in the bloc itself,    which saw relatively little expansion between 1986 and 1998.</font></p>     ]]></body>

France and Germany, which have been part of the EEC since    its creation, were included to obtain the parameters of basic behavior. That    is, the assumption was made that the coefficient of relative intensity of trade    between Brazil and these countries has not changed significantly between 1984    and 1998.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The <I>trirapport</I> indicator of relative intensity,    the analytical instrument used in this study, was calculated with a computational    routine developed using the SAS software for Windows version 8.01. This three-dimensional    indicator was used because it considers not only the country/zone of origin    and the country/zone of destination but also the product categories (k).</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2">The indicator of relative intensity is based    on the relation between the observed trade flows and the theoretical flow, with    the later being the expected result if the trade flows between a country <I>i</I>    and its partner <I>j</I> were determined solely as a function of the size of    the economy of the two partners. Thus, the indicator of relative intensity eliminates    the effect of country and/or zone size in determining international trade intensity.    The differences found between the coefficients obtained for theoretical trade    flow and relative trade intensity correspond to the fraction of bilateral trade    per category of product (<I>trirapport</I>) that is explained by key factors    in trade creation and diversion, such as geographic proximity, trade policies,    establishment of regional agreements, cultural aspects, etc. Thus, use of the    <I>Trirapport </I>indicator allows the identification of &quot;privileged&quot;    flow orientations by country at the global level.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The mathematical expression of the <I>trirapport</I><a name="vnota10"></a><a href="#nota10"><sup>10</sup></a>    coefficient, defined in Freudenberg, Gaulier and &Uuml;nal-Kesenci (1998) is    given by:</font></p>     <p align="center"> <img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a2f1.gif"></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">with</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><i>k</i>, the traded product, such that,</font></p>     <p align="center"> <img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a2f2.gif"></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><i>i</i> the country/zone of origin; </font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><i>j</i> the country/zone of destination; </font></p>     <p> <font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>V<sup>k</sup><sub>ij</sub></i> the total    value of transactions of product <I>k</I> (exports plus imports) between <I>i</I>    and <I>j</I>; </font></p>     <p> <font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>X<sub>i</sub></i> total exports of <I>i</I>,    in value;</font></p>     ]]></body>

On the other hand, if <font face="symbol">D</font><sup>k</sup><sub>ij</sub>    &gt; 1 or <font face="symbol">D</font><sup>k</sup><sub>ij</sub> &lt; 1 , trade    flows between the two considered partners are influenced by geographic, historic,    and/or political factors. Either of these two results should result in an analysis    of the specific relations between the partners involved to determine the cause    for the &quot;positive&quot; variation ( and thus an increase in the relative    intensity of trade) or the &quot;negative&quot; variation ( , and thus a reduction    in the relative intensity).</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">In summary, the analysis seeks to identify coherent    and stable links between the different elements that make up the global trade    matrix and the factors that determine these links.

Results and Discussion</B></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Results show that the indicators of relative    intensity of Brazilian agricultural product trade with its MERCOSUL partners    were always significantly above 1, even in the years in which there was a reduction    in trade. Over the entire period analyzed, these indicator values always occupied    the first three positions in terms of the relative magnitude (<a href="#tab1">Table    1</a>).</font></p>     <p><a name="tab1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><a href="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a2t1i.gif"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a2t1ith.gif" border="2"></a></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Table 1</b> = Click to enlarge</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2">The geographic proximity of Brazil with Argentina,    Paraguay, and Uruguay certainly had an influence on this behavior, but the magnitude    of the results indicates these countries’ participation in ALADI<a name="vnota12"></a><a href="#nota12"><sup>12</sup></a>    and later in MERCOSUL had a strong influence on the relative intensity of their    trade with Brazil. This is indicated because the relationship among these countries’    geographic, cultural, and historical variables remained practically<a name="vnota13"></a><a href="#nota13"><sup>13</sup></a>    stable over the period under study and the size of their economies was neutralized    through the calculation methodology. Thus, regional trade agreements were left    as the fundamental influence on trade intensity.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Over the study period, the <I>trirapport</I>    coefficient of Brazilian agricultural product trade with the NAFTA member countries    only exceeded 1 in the case of the USA, and results show that the indicator’s    value for trade between Brazil and the USA has dropped almost steadily since    1987, with the sharpest reduction occurring between 1988 and 1989. This behavior    coincides with the 1989 signing of the Free Trade Agreement between the USA    and Canada and an increase in the coefficient of relative intensity of US trade    with Canada. In 1994, the year NAFTA took effect, the coefficient between Brazil    and the USA recovered slightly; but since then it has declined repeatedly. In    1998, this coefficient was only 87% of the value that would be expected if economic    size was the determining factor in trade between the two countries.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Brazilian trade with Canada was at its most intense    at the beginning of the study period, with a relative bilateral intensity of    .98 in 1984. By 1998, this indicator’s value had fallen to .39 (<a href="#tab1">Table    1</a>). The signing of a bilateral free trade agreement between Canada and the    USA was reflected by an increase in Canada’s 1990 <I>trirapport</I> coefficient    with the USA: from 3.94 in 1988, to 4.25 in 1990. NAFTA’s later implementation    had an immediate effect on Canada’s trade with the USA, as the Canada vs. USA    <I>trirapport</I> coefficient rose from 4.82 in 1993, to 5.49 in 1994, and to    5.57 in 1998 (<a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</font></p>       <p><a name="tab2"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><a href="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a2t2i.gif"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a2t2ith.gif" border="2"></a></p>     <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Table 2</b> = Click to enlarge</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The yearly bilateral trade intensity indicator    values for Brazilian trade with Mexico were always very much within what would    have been expected given only the economic weights of Brazil and Mexico (<a href="#tab1">Table    1</a>). On the other hand, the NAFTA effect for Mexico, although positive for    its exports of agricultural goods in the first year of the Agreement, turned    neutral to slightly negative in 1996, which is an indication of Mexican economic    weakness when compared with its &quot;privileged&quot; trading partners.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The NAFTA intra-bloc effect can be better observed    by a study of trade intensity among the bloc’s three partners before and after    the bloc’s creation, as given in <a href="#tab2">Table    2</a>. Analyzing the coefficients of relative intensity of bilateral trade between    the USA (country i=USA) and the other countries of this bloc for the 33 products    (<I>k</I>= 33 categories selected) between 1993 and 1994 one finds an increase    from 3.99 to 4.62 for trade with Canada and from 4.91 to 5.51 for trade with    Mexico.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2">The indicator values for Brazilian trade with    European Union members Spain, Portugal, Austria, Finland, and Sweden generally    decreased between 1984 and 1998. The behavior of the <I>trirapport</I> indicators    for trade between Brazil and these countries supports the hypothesis that the    bloc effect is an important determinate of trade intensity with third party    (extra-bloc) countries.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The trade intensity indicator values obtained    for trade between Brazil and Spain rose from 2.53 in 1984 to 2.98 in 1985 and    then fell in 9 of the subsequent 13 years. The notable exceptions were between    1991 and 1992, when the indicator rose from 0.84 to 1.47, 1996 to 1997 (.57    to .67), and 1997 to 1998 (.67 to 1.0). Indicator values were significantly    less than 1 from 1994 to 1997.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Indicator values for Brazilian trade with Portugal    remained relatively stable and at higher levels than for Brazilian trade with    Spain. Although dropping after 1987, Brazilian trade with Portugal recovered    to 1984 levels in both 1993 and 1998, which may indicate that the strong cultural    link with Brazil contributed to attenuate the expected effect of Portugal’s    union in the European bloc.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Although the indicator values for Brazilian trade    with Austria dropped in almost all series years, the sharpest drop, to a very    unfavorable level, is found between 1994 and 1995<a name="vnota14"></a><a href="#nota14"><sup>14</sup></a>    – just after Austria joined EU15. Based on a ranking devised using the coefficients    of relative intensity Austria was in eighth position as a Brazilian trade partner    from 1984 to 1986<a name="vnota15"></a><a href="#nota15"><sup>15</sup></a>,    but fell to 20<SUP>th</SUP> in 1995 and 27<SUP>th</SUP> in 1998.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The intensity of Brazilian agricultural product    trade with Finland stayed relatively stable over the study period. As with Austria,    the greatest indicator value decline occurred from 1994 to 1995, with the coefficient    dropping from 1.49 to 0.73. The indicator later recuperated to .96 in 1998.    Finland improved its relative position as a Brazilian trading partner between    1985 and 1991 (from ninth to fifth) and reached its highest ranking in 1994    (fourth place).</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Sweden is the final member of the group of countries    that joined EU15 in 1995 to be analyzed in this study. The greatest intensity    in trade between Brazil and Sweden was in the 1980s. The greatest intensity    in the 1990s was in 1994, when the indicator once returned to a level greater    than 1. As was observed for Austria and Finland, relative trade intensity between    Brazil and Sweden fell significantly between 1994 and 1995, reaching a low that    was only 64% of the value that would be expected if the economic weight of both    countries were the only factor determining trade intensity. In terms of relative    position in the Brazilian trading partner ranking, Sweden occupied the fifth    position at the beginning of the period, fell to 11<SUP>th</SUP> place in 1995,    and to 23<SUP>rd</SUP> place in 1998.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Finally, examining the performance of Brazilian    trade with Germany and France, two countries with strong positions in the European    bloc, one finds that the <I>trirapport</I> coefficient was above 1 between 1984    and 1987, then decreased in most of the next 9 years. In 1996, the coefficient    had fallen to 0.32 for trade between Brazil and Germany and to 0.29 for trade    between Brazil and France. The indicator’s value recovered considerably between    1996 and 1998, nearing 1 for trade between Brazil and Germany in 1998. This    restored Germany to its position as one of Brazil’s top ten trade partners among    the group of ranked countries.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><b>5. Closing Remarks </b></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">In general, after eliminating the economic weight    of the studied countries at the international level, there was a noticeable    decline in the relative coefficients of bilateral trade intensity between Brazil    and its non-MERCOSUL trading partners for the aggregated 33 categories of agricultural    goods after the non-MERCOSUL countries’ entry into regional trade agreements    that excluded Brazil, which appears to indicate an extra-bloc effect. Thus,    Brazil lost space for its products in these bloc’s markets. This lost Brazilian    trade, depending on the category, was replaced by a growth in transactions among    the signatories and/or between the signatories and third party countries that,    for a variety of reasons, came to receive special treatment from these blocs.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2">An intra-bloc effect &#151; commercial expansion    &#151; can be indirectly ascertained from this study’s results for Brazilian    trade with its MERCOSUL partners and by the behavior of <I>trirapport</I> indicators    between NAFTA countries. In both cases, although geographic proximity acted    as a trade stimulant, clear growth in intra-bloc trade indicators is found after    regional trade area’s creation.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The unfavorable performances of the coefficients    of relative intensity of bilateral trade between Brazil and Austria, Finland,    and Sweden indicate changes in the demands that these countries imposed on Brazilian    products as well as the influence of the EU15’s Common Agricultural Policy on    the bilateral trade of agricultural products with third parties. On the other    hand, the results between Brazil and Portugal show that strong cultural links    can attenuate the effect of regional agreements. This variable is not normally    dominant; and as the results indicate for trade between Brazil and Argentina,    the political and economic interests of traditional &quot;rivals&quot; can largely    overcome existing cultural differences.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Finally, the Mexican experience, evaluated through    agricultural product trade indicators that represent this country’s trade relations    with its NAFTA partners, shows the necessity for calm, caution, and firmness    in the defense of national and/or regional interests on the part of representatives    of economically weak countries and/or blocs when negotiating regional agreement    with more economically developed countries. This lesson is relevant for Brazil    and other MERCOSUL members as they continue negotiations for the creation of    the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and the creation of an inter-regional    trade area between MERCOSUL and the European Union.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="verdana" size="2">BALASSA, BELA. <B>Teoria da Integra&ccedil;&atilde;o    Econ&ocirc;mica.</B> Lisboa: Livraria Cl&aacute;ssica, 1964.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&#160;<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="javascript: window.open('/scielo.php?script=sci_nlinks&ref=000128&pid=S0103-2003200300020000200001&lng=','','width=640,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=1,menubar=yes,');">Links</a>&#160;]<!-- end-ref --><!-- ref --><p><font face="verdana" size="2">CARVALHO, Maria A. de. <B>Com&eacute;rcio Agropecu&aacute;rio    Brasileiro no MERCOSUL</B>. <U>Informa&ccedil;&otilde;es Econ&ocirc;micas</U>,    SP, v. 29, n.6, p. 7-22, jun.1999.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&#160;<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="javascript: window.open('/scielo.php?script=sci_nlinks&ref=000129&pid=S0103-2003200300020000200002&lng=','','width=640,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=1,menubar=yes,');">Links</a>&#160;]<!-- end-ref --><!-- ref --><p><font face="verdana" size="2">FREUDENBERG, Michael, GAULIER, Guillaume e &Uuml;NAL-KESENCI,    Deniz. <B>La Regionalisation du Commerce International: une &eacute;valuation    par les intensit&eacute;s relatives bilaterales</B>.

Trade deviation occurs    when the socially lower-cost production of a non-member country is replaced    by production of a less efficient partner for a particular good, because of    the elimination of intra-bloc barriers and the creation of common external tariffs    for non-member countries - which makes the final price of the non-member country    artificially less competitive. Thus by maintaining extra-bloc protectionist    barriers, the free trade zone could expand the market for the products of a    particular member to a level greater that what would have resulted simply from    the dislocation of domestic production.

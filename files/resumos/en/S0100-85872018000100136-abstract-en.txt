Abstract Given the deregulation process of Argentina&#8217;s religious field, in which new expressions of spirituality proliferate outside traditional religious institutions, this article addresses the &#8220;Llave Mariana&#8217;s meditation&#8221; as a healing and self-improvement technique framed within certain forms of spirituality proper to the New Age. Our exploration intends to give an account of the way in which the representations on emotions, the notions about &#8220;energy&#8221; and the ways of inhabiting the body operate respect to Llave Mariana&#8217;s therapeutic techniques as well as in relation to their cosmovisional aspects. Finally, it proposes a more general reflection on the New Age&#8217;s meaning universe.

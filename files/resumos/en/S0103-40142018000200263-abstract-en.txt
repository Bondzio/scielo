Abstract Abdias do Nascimento first went to the United States in 1968 on a Fairfield Foundation scholarship, returning to Brazil only a decade later. During that time, painting became a meaningful activity, which demanded that he create a new identity and qualify the production of his images. In this process, he ended up declaring himself a &#8220;painter of black art&#8221; and reaffirming his commitment with the creation of works aligned with African cultural heritage.

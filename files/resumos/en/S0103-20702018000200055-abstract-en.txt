Abstract Mobility allows analyzing how, with whom, where and why people, objects, ideas, among others move, this has meant that today it is clear that there is no mobility, but a multiplicity of mobilities, with different characteristics and implications for people. This is particularly evident when we observe that the space-time experience differentiated between men and women, which often results in situations of inequality and exclusion. However, it is still necessary to deepen in giving an account of these differentiated experiences. By observing the mobility practices and decisions of men and women from an ethnographic perspective, the role of interdependence in mobility strategies in metropolitan cities such as Santiago can be unveiled, particularly in terms of the implications that mobility has on care in the city.

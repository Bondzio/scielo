Abstract Both States and integration blocs formed by them are considered instances of power that is exercised through various tools. In the case of Mercosur, the exercise of power could be studied through regional policies, being the territorial mobility an example of them. The multilateral treatment of the territorial mobility is new to the region. A subject traditionally associated to the states' internal policy is becoming a collective decision. Also, the integration logic demands a selective opening regional migration policy which contrasts with the restrictive policy towards citizens from third countries. As a consequence, a distinction between mercosurean and non-mercosurean citizens arises, tending towards the deepening of the regional integration process. This regional policy is in constant construction and debate

abstract As a literary critic, Benedito Nunes based some of his interpretations of texts by Clarice Lispector, Guimar√£es Rosa, Carlos Drummond de Andrade and others on Heidegger's Being and time. Freitag takes this fact as a starting point to place Heidegger's thought in the context of World War II and of his involvement with Nazism. Toward this end, she relies on J. Habermas' criticism of Heidegger (supported by other critics, including Marcuse, Adorno, Ott, V. Farias and E. Faye) to assess the crucial issue of whether or not it is possible to separate the philosopher from the human being as a common citizen. With this in mind, she pays special attention to Heidegger's recently published Black notebooks (Shwarze Hefte).

Before the new cartography of gender relationships and sexualities in contemporary culture, we intend to discuss in which way psychoanalysis presents itself as one of the devices of sexuality as conceived by Foucault, which tries to reinstate the traditional model of sexual difference trough the reiteration of the heterosexual norm of male domination. Furthermore, we inquire how psychoanalysis can remain a critical theory and a clinical practice that allow a productive relationship with the new configurations of gender, which disclose the conception of new forms of subjectivity. With this aim, we will analyze the psychoanalytical debate on (1) the displacements of feminine and the positiveness of femininity; (2) the homosexual marriage and the homoparentality; and (3) the clinics of transsexuality

This paper aims to interrogate the relation between the secrets of adoption and what we propose as a bioparental matrix. In according with our experience at the Project Ties of Love: Adoption, Gender, Citizenship and Rights developed at the Department of Clinical Psychology (UNESP, Assis, SP, Brazil), this arbitrary ties reinforce the suffering, the stigma and the segregation that lay on adopted people or those that will supposedly be. In that sense, we point out the culture of adoption as an important reference in the construction of the inter-subjective relationship between biological, and/or adoptive parents and adopted children in the sense that, based upon a heteronormative matrix, which presupposes a continuum among sex/gender/desire, establishes a binary distinction among legal and non-legal children based on their blood ties.

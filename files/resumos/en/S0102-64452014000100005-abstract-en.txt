Our purpose in this article is to show what we consider to be the first phase of the reception of the Frankfurt School in Brazil with emphasis on the production of some Brazilian scholars who were the pioneers in this process, not only as translators and publishers of the critical theory, but also as interpreters of the national reality. This period of history, was marked by the repression of the military regime, by the consolidation of the culture industry and at the same time the increase of the Social Sciences in the country. We point out the importance of scholars such as José Guilherme Merquior, Roberto Schwarz, Gabriel Cohn and Flávio Kothe, who in different theoretical nuances began to receive frankfurter ideas in Brazil and began its immersion in our intellectual context. We also point out yet the difficulties in understanding a very complex thought model.

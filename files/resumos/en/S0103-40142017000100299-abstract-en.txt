Abstract: This paper is a critical analysis of the public management of the Billings reservoir and of the private management of the Barra Bonita reservoir, and attempts to understand the conflicts involved in the use of these reservoirs as well as the factors that result in major environmental damage. The general hypothesis supports the idea that analyses of conflicts over the use of water in reservoirs may contribute to the understanding of business management. As methodology, representatives from Emae, Cetesb, Sabesp, AES-Tiete and CFTP were interviewed to understand better the conflicts and the factors that result in major environmental damage. The results identified difficulties in shared management between users and operators.

AbstractThis work was developed from material produced by participants of continuing education courses on gender, sexuality and education offered by the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. Analyzes three pedagogical activities carried out by education professionals in public schools in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro. Professionals who proposed to discuss homosexuality with their basic education classes as part of their own learning process. Here I attempt to conduct a critical reflection from these experiences, thinking about the didactic path that they point: to invest in the description of a homosexual/gay/lesbian subject as a way of overcoming a heteronormative perspective.

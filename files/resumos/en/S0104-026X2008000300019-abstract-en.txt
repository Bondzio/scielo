This article begins with a reflection about the influences of the travel reports - real or imaginary ones - on the modern discourse, diversity, and alterities. It also considers the reports as a power instrument, since, according to Foucault, the force of power resides in the production of positive effects in both knowledge and desire levels. Thus, the chroniclers responsible for the first descriptions of the New World are visited. Their books were very useful to the new travelers by revealing the mystery of the foreign lands, as well as their customs, alimentary habits, dressing ways, and familiar relationships, among others. The narratives written by women are then introduced considering the specificity of their approach. After all, when appearing to the public, they need to establish a relationship between space, knowledge and authority, and, in order to validate their discourse, they make use of history and references to the consulted sources. Marquesa Calderón de la Barca (Life in Mexico during a residence of two years in that country, de 1843); Condessa de Merlín (La Havane, de 1844); and Nísia Floresta (Itinerário de uma viagem à Alemanha, de 1857) are some of the writers analyzed here.

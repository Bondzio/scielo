ABSTRACT: This paper studies the images in children&#8217;s toy catalogs, observing the differences in the representation of boys and girls according to the product. The sample includes 2,223 images corresponding to the periods of Christmas in 2012 and 2015. The dissemination of stereotypes is still in force. However, in some categories of toys considered classically as masculine or feminine, interesting changes are observed which show that their representation is no longer so exclusive. There is also an important increase of mixed images, in which girls and boys share activities. In this sense, the most obvious variation is in the category of household chores. However, it should be noted that this type of message should go beyond the exhibition of mixed images.

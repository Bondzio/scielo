This paper, guided by the concepts of gender, masculinity and sexuality, examines the discourses from editorial magazine Men's Health. We identify these discourses clear marks of appreciation and defense of new ways of being male and a blatant devaluation of what we call traditional masculinity. We believe that these marks show the need to convince the readers, or a negotiation of meanings, for these men to adopt the standards suggested by the magazine without the fear of putting in doubt his heterosexuality.

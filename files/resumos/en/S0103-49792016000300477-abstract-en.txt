The market of Brazilian audiovisual contents is passing through a regular expansion. With the effective implementation of the law 12.485/2011 (new law for the cable TV), the rise of financial investments directed to the Audiovisual Sectorial Fund (Fundo Setorial do Audiovisual &#8211; FSA), the juridic-political strengthening of the National Agency of Cinema (Agência Nacional de Cinema &#8211; ANCINE) and the action of the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social &#8211; BNDES) along with the FSA. A legal and taxation arrangement was shaped which has permitted to business and creative agents of this market to adopt a casino logic. This logic potentiates the transnational struggle for the dominion and control of the emergent audiovisual markets. Such processes have been crossing each other in Brazil, but would not have effectively occurred if the main operators of the FSA had not converted themselves in state market agents.

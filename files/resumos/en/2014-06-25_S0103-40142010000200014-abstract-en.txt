This commentary on one of José Lezama Lima's (1910-1976) most memorable poems, "Oda a Julián del Casal", focuses on how six of its textual features - apostrophes, recurrent verbal motifs, obscurity, recognizability, verb tenses and moods, and mythical allusions - interact to produce an overall rhetorical effect. Julián del Casal (Cuba, 1863-1893) is now considered one of the most important Hispanic American poets of his historical moment. Lezama composed his poem in 1963 during the celebration of the centenary of Casal's birth.

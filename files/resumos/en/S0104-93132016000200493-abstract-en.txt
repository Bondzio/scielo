Abstract The paper focuses on the years between 1929 and 34, during which the missionary Celenia Pires lived and worked in Angola and collected objects that she later offered to the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro. Through an analysis of the collection and Pires' letters, the paper discusses the role of the Congregational Mission during Portuguese colonial control of Angola.

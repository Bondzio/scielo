This paper explores the consequences of the implementation of sustainable development projects in three different traditional communities of the Brazilian Amazon region. We try to make a balance the impacts on the economical, social or environmental point of view, but also to understand the relationships between the communities and the institutions promoting the projects. We show that there is some creative misunderstanding between the two parts about their respective expectations and positions.

Community courses for college entrance examination - CPVCs - face the dilemma of being simultaneously sociopolitical movements of empowerment, cultural diversity, and active citizenship as well as institution belonging to the paraschool system, fighting, thus, for inclusive actions in higher education. Studies on CPVC projects tend to enhance their ethnic, cultural, and political dimensions, pointing out that, from a pedagogical point of view, they are linked to Paulo Freire's ideas and the critical social thought. Based on statistical data from two surveys - one conducted with students from community courses for college entrance examination and the other carried out with their teachers -, the main goal of this paper is to draw the profiles of these two actors, identifying their perceptions of curriculum, teaching-learning processes, assessment, and teacher training. The work also analyzes the institutional experience of partnership between the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro - PUC-Rio - and the CPVCs as regards the granting of scholarships and permanence scholarships, and the implementation of various pedagogical activities which do not seem to form a comprehensive pedagogical policy for good quality inclusive education. It offers alternatives for inclusion to occur not only at the quantitative level, but also ensuring good quality teaching for both college access and the fundamental consolidation of basic education.

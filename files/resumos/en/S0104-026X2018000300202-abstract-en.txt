Abstract: This article is not an attempt to study the vocality and orality in written and legal texts. What I have in mind is whether, how and why gender guidelines acted in cross ways in the speeches made by government legislation of Alfonso X (1252-1284), especially with regard to certain activities, practices or legal offices which are directly or indirectly associated with the credibility of the talk or the use of words. The proposal here is to test the limits and possibilities of proposing an Institutional History of Gender, combining the field of Cultural History of Medieval Law and Gender Studies. Discusses the intersectionality between power relations and processes of meaning, ie, &#8220;d(en)omination&#8221;.

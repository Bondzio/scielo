<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the end of the Cold War, Vietnamese foreign   policy has been oriented towards safeguarding the country's interests in the   Southeast Asia (SEA), particularly in the South China Sea (SCS). In line with   the view of authorities in Hanoi, these areas are critical for regional and   ultimately global security. The importance ascribed to the region has been   closely connected to China's aspiration to strengthen both its economic   security (including food and energy security) and military defense as a means   to assert itself as a global power. The SCS important resources include oil and   gas reserves as well as fish stocks, and the waters of the SCS represent the   second most used sea lane in the world. Against this backdrop, Vietnam's   strategy towards the SEA and the SCS rests on a combination of economic and   geostrategic calculations. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Indeed, the SEA, especially the SCS, has consistently   been defined as an integral part of Vietnam's core national interest at both   socioeconomic and geostrategic levels. The economic importance of the SCS is   confirmed by forecasts that estimate that by 2020, "the maritime economy will   contribute up to 55% of Vietnam's GDP and will account for 55&#150;60% of its   exports."<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> On the other hand, the geostrategic   position of the SCS boosts the country's relevance in the foreign policy front,   since it offers Vietnam critical strategic weight in dealing with external   powers involved in the region.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, not surprisingly, the development of the   maritime economy is viewed in Hanoi as a precondition to strengthen the   country's national security and defense, which should be promoted in the spirit   of international cooperation. On June 21, 2012, the Vietnamese National   Assembly passed the Vietnamese Maritime Law, which, according to Pham Binh   Minh, Vietnam's Foreign Affairs Minister, represents "the inevitable   requirement for Vietnam's economic development cause" while also asserting   "Vietnam's sovereignty" over the SCS, namely over the contested Paracel and   Spratly islands.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given the great power predisposition exhibited by   Chinese foreign policy in the new millennium, a disposition which has been   supported by its strong economic weight and political leverage, relations with   China represent a fundamental factor in Hanoi's strategic calculations. That   being said, the increase in tension due to territorial disputes over the SCS   has triggered a dilemma that has thus far hindered a positive evolution in the   bilateral relations between the two countries. These tensions exacerbated in   2007, when a number of incidents occurred against the backdrop of the renewed   assertion of sovereignty by the People's Republic of China (PRC) State Council.   This was especially reflected in the declaration on Sansha as an integral part   of the province of Hainan; as well as the political emphasis placed upon the   country's territorial rights and, consequently, China's sovereign power to use   force to protect national territories.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> In the spring of 2007, China opposed to   Vietnam's deal with the British Petroleum (BP),<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a> and as a result, the   BP had to shelve its initial plans to develop an oil and gas field off the   Southern Vietnamese coast. In early summer of 2007, China has requested further   oil and gas firms to stop their exploration-oriented activities with the   Vietnamese partners in the SCS, while threatening these companies with   unspecified consequences for their business dealings with China (in case they   failed to meet the request).<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a> In July 2007, Chinese naval patrol   boats have opened fire against a Vietnamese fishing boat in the Spratlys,   leading up to the sinking of this boat and the death of one of its crew   members. In addition, the imposition of unilateral fishing bans in the SCS in   2009 was also one of the causes behind the rising political tension.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a> Furthermore, China has protested against Vietnam's application to the United   Nations Commission on Limits to Continental Shelves (UNCLCS) in May 2009, to   extend the country's continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles into the   SCS from its coastline. Furthermore, the day after Vietnam's application at   UNCLCS, on May 7, 2009, the Chinese government submitted its own request to the   UNCLCS, with a map referring to Chinese claims in the SCS, delineated by a   U-shaped line composed of a number of separate dashes. If these dashes were   connected, the resulting line would allocate up to 90% of the SCS to China,   including the Paracel Islands, Spratly Islands and Macclesfield Bank. In July   2012, China established the Sansha administrative district (covering all the Paracels   and Spratlys Islands) in Hainan Island.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new and more forceful posture of the Chinese   leadership has been challenging the idea of Beijing's foreign policy as one   being built on the "peaceful rise" formula. In fact, it seems that the   achievement of "China's Dream," i.e. the transformation of the country into the   world's leading power, will be accompanied by the country's military projection   into, and mounting tension in, the SCS region.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, it should be stressed that the   Sino-Vietnamese disputes also have a distinct economic dimension due to the   prospects of further exploitation of hydrocarbon resources in the SCS. From   this perspective, China's assertiveness vis-&agrave;-vis Vietnam could be interpreted   as a pressure on ExxonMobile, British Petroleum and other international   companies, which have been assisting Vietnam with hydrocarbon exploitation in   the region. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From a security perspective, the potential   militarization of the SCS disputes that threaten the stability and prosperity   of the SEA states, including Vietnam, represents the principal concern of the   countries in the region. There is a general apprehension that one or more of   these disputes might lead to an armed conflict between China and some states of   the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Vietnam is a case in point   since it has been involved in intensive and escalating tensions linked to   territorial disputes with China in the SCS. In addition, the actions, measures,   and policies adopted by China towards enhancing its influence in the region   might generate negative effects upon the process of regional integration via   undermining the consolidation of an intra-ASEAN unity. A unified and strong   ASEAN's position towards China has the potential to mitigate Chinese leverage   in the region as a whole since ASEAN institutions and activities are given   special attention by authorities in Beijing, as platforms where the dialogue   over critical regional issues is taking place.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While most of the literature devoted to the rise of   China examines its origins and implications for the balance of power in the   region and in world politics, this study aims at investigating how Vietnam has   been coping with the complex challenge represented by the "rise of China." The   Vietnamese strategy has been informed by the hedging strategy. Many works that   have explored hedging strategies in SEA focus on those undertaken by US, Japan,   and India. This article, on the contrary, points that other major actors have   been emerging as a part of SEA states hedging strategies. The article thus   explores the role which the EU and Russia have been playing in Vietnam's hedging   approach, while highlighting particular features of the Vietnamese strategy,   which has acquired a specific nuance that calls for the use of the notion of   strategic hedging.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fact that Vietnam is overlooked by mainstream   literature focusing on the SEA is intriguing for a variety of different   reasons. The country represents a case of a middle power<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a> which, due to its geostrategic position, is expected to play an increasingly   relevant role in shaping SEA's security environment. As an important strategic   player in the SEA and Asia-Pacific regions, Vietnam is in a position to   contribute more positively to regional maritime security both alongside other   middle powers and major powers in the Asia-Pacific. It is also a key player in   ASEAN-centric architecture, helping to shape the future contours of the   regional integration dynamics. Equally important, Vietnam is a littoral state   on the SCS through which vital sea lines of communication (SLOCs) pass.   Finally, the relevance of this case study springs from the fact that "China's   Dream" causes Vietnam to face stark choices, difficult dilemmas and acute   challenges regarding its relationship with China. This is the case mainly   because the level of dependency exhibited by Vietnam vis-&agrave;-vis China is greater   when compared to other states in the region. At the same time, given the   geographical proximity and the social-culture affinities, China's influence in   Vietnam's economic and political security, in addition to the country's   cultural and social life, is sizeable. Consequently, the country has seen its   room for maneuver in both the regional and international sphere being   dramatically reduced, increasing the feeling of necessity to notably turn the   situation around by undertaking what this study calls "strategic hedging."   Along these lines, it is worth noting that the case of Vietnam allows one to   gauge major complex challenges and pressures posed to other countries in the   region by the not-so-peaceful rise of China and to hint at the potential that   this holds for the improvement of the international roles of both the EU and   Russia in the SEA.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Vietnam's foreign policy in the regional context</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The current political choices of Vietnam's foreign   policy should be viewed as a consequence of the experience of both political   and economic isolation which Vietnam underwent in the late 1980s. As a result   of that, greater importance came to be ascribed to the expansion of foreign   relations as the necessary condition, not only for overcoming political   isolation and economic blockade, but also for building up a strong economy.   Vietnam's economic reforms, which were inaugurated in 1986, started to reflect this   outlook: Hanoi recognized the importance of expanding foreign relations with   all countries while paying special attention to its neighboring states and big   powers. Lessons learned from the experience of isolation became part of a new   foreign policy thinking, whose emphasis was now placed on the country's   integration into regional and international markets on the basis of a new   division of labor. Eventually, this new thinking entailed the adoption by the   Vietnamese leadership of a new concept: "comprehensive security."<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a> While confirming the prioritization of military affairs, the adoption of the   aforementioned concept allowed for a new foreign policy which also supported   national economic development. Reinforced by the "being-a-friend-to-all"   approach, which Vietnam has consistently pursued since the end of Cold War,<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup>12</sup></a> the concept of "comprehensive security" has guided Vietnam's foreign policy   until today. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since 1991, as part of the new foreign policy   thinking, the country has continuously promoted a rapprochement with China. In   addition to this, Hanoi has been increasingly interested in participating in   regional organizations, notably ASEAN. In line with both the aspiration to open   the country's economy and with the "being-a-friend-to-all" approach underlying   national foreign policy, participation in such organizations has been viewed as   crucial to both national security and economic development. Hence, Vietnam   decided to apply for accession to ASEAN and became an official member of the   organization in 1995&#151;something that has enabled Vietnam to full-fledgedly   participate in all multilateral arrangements in force. Since then, together   with the remaining member states of ASEAN, Vietnam has been proactive in   building up the regional security architecture, of which the East Asia Summit   (EAS)<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><sup>13</sup></a> is just one example.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, Vietnam's bilateral relationship with China   has not been free of tensions. The legacy resulting from the border war in 1979   and the military conflicts linked to territorial disputes over the Spratly   Islands in 1988 left their marks on the current Sino-Vietnamese relationship.   Therefore, relations between the two countries represent a fundamental factor   in Hanoi's strategic calculations, as it will be discussed later in the   article. These historical legacies have aggravated the perception of complex   security challenges confronting Hanoi. Nowadays, they still shape the   Vietnamese position regarding the SCS, hinder the positive evolution of the   bilateral relations between Vietnam and China, and exacerbate the situation   around the SCS conflicts. Nevertheless, the same historical legacies help   explain some decisions and statements which may appear to be, to some   observers, a diplomatic "overreaction." This is the case, for instance, of the   statements indicating Vietnam's concern over Beijing's lenient position   regarding the dissemination of ideas on the internet regarding the Chinese   "invasion of Vietnam."<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><sup>14</sup></a> To the Vietnamese leadership, the   position taken by the Chinese authorities is considered excessively benevolent,   and serves as yet another indication of the contradictory nature of the   "China's Dream." </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to understand Vietnamese policy regarding the   protection of its national interests in the SCS, it is important to take into   account that, historically speaking, the relationship between Vietnam and China   has always been embedded in a structure of persistent asymmetry.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><sup>15</sup></a> Consequently, the major strategic preoccupation of Hanoi's leadership has been   how to use the levers of diplomacy, economic relations, and military ties to   maintain the country's autonomy. At the same time, the room of maneuver for the   Vietnamese authorities has been rapidly decreasing, calling for a reaction on   the part of Hanoi. For example, the SCS disputes touch upon Vietnam's core   national and security issues, as well as its economic development. Thus, as   mentioned above, Vietnam has promoted its claims of sovereignty over the   Paracel and Spratly islands in the SCS, including at the UNCLCS, and also   adopted the Vietnamese Maritime Law in June 2012. With the adoption of this   Law, the country for the first time has a document legally defining Vietnam's   sovereign rights in the SCS.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>16</sup></a> In practice, this means Vietnam   continues to reject Chinese claims (referring to the U-shaped, nine-dash line)   and is by no means prepared to abdicate from fishing or oil exploration in   these areas, which Vietnam considers to be inside its exclusive economic zone.   However, the Law clarifies that Vietnam's policy is oriented towards the   principle of resolving the disagreements and disputes over the islands and seas   by peaceful means, in accordance with the UNCLCS and international law and   practices. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the same time, it should be noted that the foreign   policy options available to Hanoi have been limited. Both options which could   be considered as an alternative to hedging, i.e. aligning with the US, or   strengthening the ASEAN as a counterweight to China, present important   shortcomings which need to be carefully considered in Hanoi.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><sup>17</sup></a> An   exclusive pro-US orientation could not only upset the relationship with other   strategic partners, such as Russia, critical to Hanoi's foreign policy   considerations, but also generate domestic political costs associated with   political liberalization. As for the ASEAN option, it represents a   heterogeneous group of countries which do not necessarily support an overt   objective of acting as a counterweight to China. A potential reordering of   objectives stemming from a rethinking of the ASEAN relationship with China   would put in danger the region's integration process. The latter is clearly not   an objective of the Vietnamese leadership. ASEAN plays an important role in   Vietnamese foreign policy in hedging against China since it allows Hanoi to   discuss the SCS issue from the position of ASEAN (i.e. as a group). Along with   ASEAN, ASEAN's Regional Forum (ARF) and EAS are also important. They have been   established to discuss regional security issues, including maritime security,   and are therefore critical to Hanoi's objective of dealing with the SCS   disputes by moving them from a bilateral to a multilateral agenda. Furthermore,   the discussion of the SCS issue entails the involvement of external players in   their capacity as members of these fora to portray their commitment to strive   towards peace, stability, and prosperity of the region. All this corroborates   Vietnam's perspective on regional security and its national interests, to the   extent that ASEAN, ARF, and EAS have become critical instruments in support of   the Vietnamese position. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, it is important to note that when dealing   with SCS issues, the Vietnamese authorities have been facing the need to strike   a balance between domestic and international politics surrounding this matter.   Internally, the Vietnamese government has been under pressure to introduce   effective measures to protect the country's territorial integrity, to secure   maritime interests, and to promote the welfare of its people. Hence, the   government had to show a firm position on the SCS disputes in order to forge   domestic consensus regarding a matter critical for national security.   Externally, the government has attempted to avoid exacerbating the situation   while trying to avoid being seen as adopting a confrontational approach with   regard to the other claimants. The reasons behind this foreign policy stance   are twofold. On the one hand, they include the adherence of Hanoi, from 1986   onwards, to the principles of good neighborhood policy vis-&agrave;-vis the SEA   countries. On the other hand, they are informed by Vietnam's aspiration to   forge a common ASEAN position regarding the SCS disputes. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All the above-mentioned constraints and dilemmas which   Hanoi has been facing in light of the new assertive posture of a rising China   have been critical to Vietnam's foreign policy choices in the complex SEA   region. These choices ultimately culminate in the adoption of a position, which   can be called "strategic hedging."</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Hedging in Vietnam's foreign   policy </b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Contemporary   academic literature has paid little attention to the hedging strategy. That   being said, hedging is defined as "a purposeful act in which a state seeks to   insure its long term interests by placing its policy bets on multiple   countering options that are designed to offset risks embedded in the international   systems."<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>18</sup></a> The objective of   hedging is to "cultivat&#91;e&#93; a middle position that forestalls or avoids having   to choose one side at the obvious expense of another."<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><sup>19</sup></a> In this regard, states will continue to stay in the "middle" of balancing and   bandwagoning. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Strategic hedging behavior, which may assume various   forms, notably economic, diplomatic, or even military, "helps states cope with   the threats and constraints they are likely to encounter under conditions of   unipolarity, while simultaneously preparing them for new threats and   opportunities that are likely to emerge as the system leader falls farther into   relative decline."<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><sup>20</sup></a> Thus, strategic hedging allows   minimizing long-term threats and maximizing long-term opportunities. It can   enhance a given state's capabilities, impossible to obtain through other   strategies, e.g. hard balancing.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><sup>21</sup></a> Such an enhancement is particularly   crucial for Vietnam in view of an unrivaled rise of China. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, strategic hedging can also improve the   ability of the hedging state to decrease its dependence on public goods or   direct subsidies which are provided by the country that is being hedged   against.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><sup>22</sup></a> Notwithstanding Vietnam's strategy of   economic diversification, China's prevailing influence is undeniable,   especially in the context of the former's substantial trade deficit which in   the first nine months of the year 2012 amounted to US$ 11.3 billion.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><sup>23</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Vietnamese government saw the Chinese investment   both as a solution to the problem of deficit reduction and as precondition of   the increase of its exports, which had become critical after Vietnam's   accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007. However, the   encouragement of Chinese investments in Vietnam had negative consequences.   Economically, due to Vietnamese enterprises' weakness and/or lack of   competitiveness vis-&agrave;-vis the Chinese ones, Vietnam's economic dependence on   China has been reinforced. Eventually, China's leverage has increased with the   possibility of introducing sanctions against Vietnam in the context of tensions   in the SCS.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, encouraging the Chinese economic   investment on national territory has been a double-edged sword for Vietnam's   government also due to the prevailing strong anti-China domestic feelings.   Symptomatic of this is the criticism that has been voiced against the Prime   Minister Nguyen Tan Dung by such high-ranked figures as the 97-year-old General   Vo Nguyen Giap, that is a national military icon.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><sup>24</sup></a> The   General's criticism, whose main target was the controversial bauxite mining   venture involving China in 2009,<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>25</sup></a> soon evolved into a public   manifestation of the existing fears of Chinese economic imperialism, expansion,   and even colonization. At the same time, the support given to the project by   many of the most powerful members of the Vietnamese Communist Party was   interpreted as a result of the Chinese bribery of these officials, viewed as   being kowtowing to China and selling themselves out to Beijing and to   capitalism.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>26</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along these lines, the strategic hedging presented   itself as an especially valuable political option to the Vietnamese government.   That being said, strategic hedging is no panacea for the resolution of the SEA   problems and involves risks. These risks are not only linked to Vietnam's   foreign policy autonomy, but also to the formidable balance of power that has   been promoted and safeguarded by ASEAN. The risks are exacerbated by the   growing arm race in the region. According to Evan S. Medeiros, "hedging is fraught   with complications and dangers that could   precipitate a shift toward rivalry and regional instability,"<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>27</sup></a> mainly due to the increasing competitive engagement of external players in the   Southeast Asia region, at the cost of the marginalization of ASEAN. To be sure,   this is a scenario that does not correspond to Vietnam's national interests.   Finally, it should be said that in order to be a viable option the former   requires flexibilities of alignments,<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><sup>28</sup></a> and a skillful   implementation of the strategy involved. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This hedging   research stream suggests that Vietnam walks a very fine line     in its strategy towards the US, ASEAN, and China, and makes adjustments   depending on its national interest.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><sup>29</sup></a> The reason behind   adopting a hedging behavior is that small states, such as Vietnam, "cannot get   too 'cozy' with either Washington or Beijing because it makes the other country   uncomfortable."<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><sup>30</sup></a> Indeed, Vietnam   does not want to be seen as a bulwark for Chinese containment.     It also does not want to court trade only with American firms, nor does it want      to court US support in security relations in the SEA region. Furthermore,   Vietnam     does not simply bandwagon with China. Instead, Vietnam adopts hedging     vis-&agrave;-vis China. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, given   this preference for hedging dynamics, Vietnam has been opting for the following   twofold strategy. On the one hand, Vietnam's foreign policy has sought to   engage China while aiming to repair and deepen the relationship between the two   countries. On the other hand, Hanoi's strategy has been designed to buttress   this foreign policy option by seeking to engage other great powers in the   region, notably the US, India, Japan, the EU, and Russia, in order to   counterweight Chinese ambition. While supporting this twofold strategic orientation,   Vietnamese foreign policy has paid special attention to regional institutions,   predominantly to ASEAN, due to its capacity of keeping China engaged while   simultaneously restraining Beijing's assertive and sometimes even aggressive   behavior in the SCS. Economic relations are part of this twofold strategy:   Vietnam uses its economic relations to deepen both bilateral ties with China   and engage it in multilateral fora, such as ASEAN. Accordingly, Vietnam is   expected to continue to further develop relationships with major external   players in addition to ASEAN, as part of its quest for economic growth and   security.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An illustration of   Vietnam's strategic hedging is the position adopted by the Vietnamese   leadership on the issue of the Cam Ranh port. The latter is strategically   located in the SEA and Western Pacific and is only 1,000 km away from the   Hainan Island, where the Chinese government established the Sansha   administrative district. The importance of the base stems from the fact that   this base can be used to encircle China, blocking its access to Asia-Pacific,   thus diminishing China's extensive influence over Vietnam. An upgraded Cam Ranh   base might thus allow for naval force projections into disputed areas in the   SCS.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><sup>31</sup></a> In these   circumstances, the issue of external actors' access to the Cam Ranh base   acquires critical importance; by allowing a foreign country to enter the base   (even if only for purposes of fuel refilling and maintenance), Hanoi does not   only open the possibility of strengthening military cooperation, but also   forging a strategic anti-China alliance. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the past years,   especially since 2000, Vietnam has strengthened its security cooperation and   relationships with naval forces from the US, Russia, and India, among others,   thereby reinforcing its strategic role in the region. However, instead of   choosing one particular country and granting access to the latter, Hanoi's   tactic has been to adopt strategic hedging. Eventually, this option would allow   maximizing the benefits brought about from using the base. The decision has   been backed up by two carefully calculated steps. Firstly, in October 2010,   Vietnam declared that it "will sell its military port services to all navies,   including submarines"<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><sup>32</sup></a> at the Cam Ranh   port after the upgrade of the port, despite not having mentioned the time when   the upgrade would start and when the port would be officially open to all   countries<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><sup>33</sup></a>&#151;with the exception   of the upgrade duration, which is planned to take three years.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><sup>34</sup></a> The facility would offer "repair services to foreign naval ships and submarines   and could be &#91;used as&#93; a fuel stop for aircraft carriers."<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><sup>35</sup></a> Vietnam thus decided not to lease Cam Ranh port to any foreign partner, instead   focusing on actively diversifying cooperation with different countries.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eventually, the   hedging illustrated by the case of the Cam Ranh port allowed Hanoi to achieve   two goals. Firstly, in line with its foreign policy objectives, Hanoi avoided   direct confrontation with China (or any other party). Secondly, Vietnam has   increased its leverage vis-&agrave;-vis external powers that are competing with one   another to increase their influence in the region. The decision has also   enabled Hanoi to profile itself as a "reliable partner," something that can   help draw attention of major external players with geopolitical interests in   the region. Eventually, this increasing interest on the part of the external   powers is expected to produce the necessary containment effect over Chinese   behavior in the SCS.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Vietnam-EU: the economic hedging dynamics</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It comes as no surprise that Vietnam has been   increasingly anxious about the growing power of the "Giant of the North" and   its consequences for its national economic interests. China is currently one of   the biggest economic partners of Vietnam and therefore holds an important   position in the country's economy.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><sup>36</sup></a> Indeed, it is one of the largest   Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) providers<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><sup>37</sup></a>: in the period of   2002&#150;2009, China figures as the 5<sup>th</sup> largest investor with the total   capital of US$ 649.9 million. In the manufacturing field alone,   Chinese investments in Vietnam have risen from US$ 20 million in 2005   to more than US$ 300 million in 2010.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><sup>38</sup></a> Through its investment, economic aid, and development aid,<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><sup>39</sup></a> China has reinforced Vietnam's dependence. Moreover, aid and financial   assistance originating from Beijing and flowing to Vietnam indicate that   finding out solutions regarding how to deal with Vietnam's increasingly   powerful neighbor is far from an easy task. The growing economic dependence on   China has led to a drastic reduction of leverage for Hanoi's authorities (i.e.   autonomy and independence in decision-making processes). This considerably   thwarts the capacity of Vietnam to resolve the SCS disputes on equal footing   with China. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this regard, EU has the potential to profile itself   as an economic partner able to ultimately counterbalance the economic leverage   of China in the Vietnamese economy, favoring Hanoi. Indeed, the EU provides   Vietnam with an alternative to economic diversification while reducing the   country's dependence on China, both in trade and FDI&#151;even after having been   dramatically hit by economic and financial crises.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Due to prevailing tensions between the two countries   and the increasingly serious concern about China's presence within its national   economy, the Vietnamese government has attempted to diminish its reliance on   trade with China through expanding its export portfolio&#151;although not   exclusively&#151;to the Eurozone. As a result, in 2010, the EU became Vietnam's   third major trade partner with &euro; 13,403.4 million and its second   major export partner with &euro; 8,589.9 million (accounting for 16.7% of   the value of Vietnam's exports with the world), while China held the fourth   position with &euro; 5,537.2 million (10.8%).</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, Vietnam has become highly dependent on FDI   originating from China. The latter's cooperation with Vietnam in the critical   export-oriented rubber, tire, and coffee industries has increasingly   transformed Vietnam into one of China's manufacturing and resource-saturated   "provinces." Pressed to diversify its investments in order to prevent itself   from being exploited and dominated by Chinese investors, Vietnam has been   seeking more investments coming from the EU. The EU has been attributed a   special role in this regard, as the total FDI inflow to Vietnam coming from the   EU between 2002 and 2009 amounts to US$ 4,7 billion (as compared to   US$ 649,9 million coming from China), which makes the EU the second   largest external investor in Vietnam, just after the US.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><sup>40</sup></a> In   2011, the EU's FDI in Vietnam was US$ 32 billion, encompassing   1,687 projects<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><sup>41</sup></a>, which amounted to more than 12% of   Vietnam's total FDI.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><sup>42</sup></a> This was ten times bigger that the FDI   coming from China, which covered 805 projects with a total pledged   investment capital of US$ 3.184 billion. This position of the EU has   been reinforced in 2012, with an FDI record of US$ 1 billion.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><sup>43</sup></a> The EU has also remained the main provider of development aid to Vietnam.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rapport with   the EU has been highly valued by Hanoi's authorities. Assessing bilateral   cooperation between the EU and Vietnam, particularly in the fields of trade and   investment, Vietnamese National Assembly Chairman Nguyen Sinh Hung referred to   the EU's "privileged position in Vietnamese foreign policy."<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><sup>44</sup></a> Moreover, Foreign Affairs Minister Pham Binh Minh has highlighted the   importance of this bilateral relationship for regional security where he saw   "favorable conditions for the EU to promote and strengthen its role in SEA   region."<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><sup>45</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Due to the   importance attached by both parties to the bilateral relationship, they have   endeavored to strengthen their rapport so as to move it to a more advanced   level. Indicative of this was the signing of a new Partnership and Cooperation   Agreement (PCA), on June 27, 2012,<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><sup>46</sup></a> in Brussels, in addition to the   launching of formal negotiations for a Vietnam-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on   June 26, 2012. The entry into force and subsequent implementation of the PCA   and the eventual establishment of an FTA are recognized by Vietnam's Foreign   Affairs Minister Pham Binh Minh as important new milestones in the evolution of   relations between Vietnam and the EU, both bilaterally and multilaterally.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><sup>47</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The EU is currently Vietnam's second trading partner,   with bilateral trade amounting to US$ 24.29 billion in 2011.   Vietnam's exports to the EU have increased by 33.5% in 2011.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><sup>48</sup></a> In   addition, large EU-based energy companies such as BP have been involved in oil   and gas exploitation and drilling in the region. The considerable trade   turnover between the European companies and the regional states, including   Vietnam, is closely connected to the freedom of navigation and the stability of   the SCS. This fact has urged stronger EU engagement in regional security   matters, and especially into the maritime security in the SCS.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><sup>49</sup></a> Along   these lines, whilst it is clear that the EU's economic presence in the SEA is   growing at a fast pace, it is also true that this circumstance has been   particularly promoted by the Vietnamese authorities since it enhances the   country's capacity to address the complex challenges and pressures stemming   from the rise of China.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><sup>50</sup></a></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In contrast, the EU is unwilling to have any   significant military force in the region, which could further complicate the   already puzzling regional military equation while sending wrong signals for   both insiders and outsiders. The EU declines to participate in the region's   militarization arguing that the region's realist thinking as well as its trends   towards militarization and confrontational policies might lead the region into   disastrous wars similar to the ones Europe experienced during the 20<sup>th</sup> century. <a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><sup>51</sup></a> Therefore, the EU attempts to make a   contribution to the resolutions of the SCS disputes through pursuing a "soft"   policy. Its position on the SCS is promoted in various meetings, including   those of the ASEAN, ARF, and EAS, in which the EU stresses the need for a   peaceful resolution of the existing conflicts while emphasizing the need to   respect international law. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The EU has also demonstrated its support for the   ASEAN-China Code of Conduct (COC) of the parties in the South China Sea. The   latter provides guiding principles for solutions to the SCS disputes among   claimants, which should be found through the application of "peaceful means,   without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly consultations   and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned, in accordance with   universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 UN   Convention on the Law of the Sea."<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><sup>52</sup></a> In addition, the EU has consistently   promoted the position that all SEA states, including Vietnam and China, need to   define their exact position regarding the claims in the SCS disputes. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, the EU has declared that it was ready to   share its own experiences with regards to maritime disputes and fishing rights.   Thus, the EU strengthens its position in the SEA as a mediator in the current   tensions and any potential conflict. The statement of Philippe van Amersfoort,   Deputy Head of the Southeast Asia Division in the European External Action   Service is a vivid illustration of this fact. The EU official has namely   declared that the "EU would welcome any request from ASEAN to help resolve the   dispute. As this strategic situation develops, the EU may be a useful element   of balance."<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><sup>53</sup></a> Along these lines, not only does the   EU play an important role in helping Vietnam to reduce its economic dependence   on China, but the EU has already started to engage itself in the search for   solutions to the SCS disputes, notably through emphasizing the respect for   international laws by the involved parties in any dispute, for the sake of   regional and global security issues related to the freedom of navigation in the   area. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is not difficult to find examples that illustrate   the increasing role of the EU in the domain of the SCS issues. On the one hand,   the EU has promoted the rapprochement with Vietnam. On February 29, 2012, the 1<sup>st</sup> EU-Vietnam political dialogue at the Vice-Minister level was established to   exchange views on promoting convergence regarding several issues of common interest,   including developments in the SCS. On the other hand, at the 19<sup>th</sup> ARF meeting held in Cambodia on July 12, 2012, the EU, together with the US,   reached a joint statement in which it was stated that they "will cooperate with   Asian partners to enhance maritime security based on international law as   specified in United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as well as   contribute to confidence building measures to increase trust in order to reduce   the risks of crisis and conflicts."<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><sup>54</sup></a> The EU has expressed its willingness   to continue to pay close attention to the regional security situation and   support ASEAN's position; and at the same time, along with the US, to "continue   to encourage ASEAN and China to promote building the COC and to resolve the   disputes through peaceful solutions, diplomacy, and cooperation."<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><sup>55</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The position that has   been adopted so far by the EU does not explicitly support Vietnam in the SCS   disputes, neither does it strengthen Hanoi's military posture vis-&agrave;-vis China.   However, an ever closer relationship between Vietnam and the EU has been   critical to the Hanoi's approach marked by strategic hedging. In other words,   it has been vital to diminish the country's economic dependence on China while   generating further support to the existing regional security institutions which   tend to restrain China's behavior.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Vietnam-Russia: the military hedging</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the military-political level, the US remains the   only external player in the SEA with the capacity of counterweighing China's   powerful influence. The military expenditure of the US exceeds that of China   sevenfold and that of Russia tenfold. The US holds the largest amount of   military spending with US$ 711 billion annually while   US$ 143 billion and US$ 71.9 billion is spent by China and   Russia respectively.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><sup>56</sup></a> Recently, Vietnam and the US have   strengthened their military cooperation through the reinforcement of defiance   cooperation and the launching of initiatives such as a political-military   dialogue and direct military-to-military contacts.<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><sup>57</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That being said, it is important to emphasize the   significant role played by Russia when it comes to the issue of SCS disputes in   which Vietnam has been involved. While the US is considered a guarantor of   regional security, Russia represents a tangible threat to China for three main   reasons. Firstly, Vietnam and Russia have a long history of friendship,   support, and military alignment against China. This cooperation has encompassed   the establishment of a common front during the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese Border War   as well as during the ensuing conflict which persisted over a period of ten   years. Secondly, Russia has been present in the SCS area since the 1980s, long   before the US. As a result of this, Russia has longstanding economic interests   in the SCS that include cooperation with Vietnam in oil and gas exploitation   projects. Thirdly, Moscow and Hanoi have signed several contracts to sell   modern weapons, including submarines and aircrafts to Vietnam, as will be   elaborated below. Thus, all the naval weapons in use in Vietnam, including the   critical Kilo class submarines, as well as Su-30Mkk fighters, have been   purchased from Russia, which allowed Vietnam to strengthen its military   capability in preparation for armed conflicts. This longstanding history of   military-industrial cooperation and the currently close relations in this area   make a fundamental difference between Vietnam-Russia and Vietnam-US relations   on the SCS issue.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Modern weapons, especially submarines, are critical to   any power in the SCS facing the possibility   of an armed conflict. This is particularly the case in light of China's rapid   military modernization. Indeed, the Chinese defense expenditure, with an   impressive double-digit growth for almost two decades, has remarkably   reinforced the country's power projection capability in both conventional and   nuclear terms. In 2011, China's total military expenditure was   US$ 119 billion, the second largest in the world;<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><sup>58</sup></a> while the respective number in 2009 was US$ 70 billion.<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><sup>59</sup></a> In addition, the country is upgrading its naval base in Hainan Island and   building two aircraft carriers as part of a military modernization program.<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><sup>60</sup></a></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vietnam has also undertaken measures towards military   modernization. In 2009, Vietnam announced that it would procure six   conventional diesel-powered Kilo class submarines from Russia, which are   scheduled to be delivered by 2014. These submarines are likely to be equipped   with sea-skimming 3M-54 Klub anti-ship missiles with a range of 300 km. In   February 2012, Russia announced it will co-produce the Uran anti-ship missile   (SS-N-25 Switchable) with Vietnam.<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><sup>61</sup></a> While the submarines are being built,   Russia and India are currently in charge of training Vietnamese officers who   will work in the submarines.<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><sup>62</sup></a> These new submarines are expected to   improve Vietnam's defense system since they allow to operate more quickly and   effectively in the SCS. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The acquisition of military capabilities is critical,   not only purely for the sake of defense and strategic calculations, but also   for the important function it plays in the safeguarding of both economic   interests and the security of oil field explorations in the SCS. This latter   aspect is particularly critical given the role that Russia has been playing   herein. Indeed, the lion's share of these exploitation projects has being   undertaken by Vietnam jointly with Russia. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cooperation in oil exploitation between Vietnam   and Russia dates back to the 1980s, when the Soviet Union together with Vietnam   established in 1981 a joint venture, Vietsovpetro. The major objective of this   cooperation was to exploit oil in the White Tiger oilfield in the SCS, which   still remains to be the largest one in Vietnam. Vietsovpetro is presently the   main force behind Vietnam's petroleum industry and economy. To date,   Vietsovpetro has produced more than 185 million tons of crude oil and more   than 21 billion cubic meters of associated gas and liquefied petroleum gas   from the White Tiger, Dragon, and Big Bear oilfields in the SCS area.   Incidentally, all these fields are inside the zone contested by China. Eighty   percent of Vietnamese oil and gas comes from Vietsovpetro, ranking Vietnam as   the third largest oil producer and exporter in SEA. In addition, Vietsovpetro's   total crude-oil turnover up until now is US$ 33 billion, contributing   US$ 20.2 billion to Vietnam's state budget (which corresponds to   22&#150;25% of the state income).<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><sup>63</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The cooperation has generated high dividends for both   Vietnam and Russia. In the field of oil industry alone, the two-way trade   turnover rose from US$ 1.83 billion in 2009<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><sup>64</sup></a> to   US$ 33 billion, as of July 2012.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><sup>65</sup></a> This cooperation has   triggered further Russian investment into various projects in Vietnam. By 2008,   Russia had 59 projects with a total registered capital of over   US$ 376 million, surpassing China's FDI in that particular year   (which amounted to US$ 53 million). In the first half of 2009, Russia   became the 5<sup>th</sup> foreign investor; once again surpassing China;   shortly thereafter it became the biggest foreign investor in Vietnam, with two   new projects valued at US$ 330 million in registered capital.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><sup>66</sup></a> As of July 2012, Russia had 80 investment projects in Vietnam with total   registered capital of US$ 920 million.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><sup>67</sup></a> Investments have been mainly concentrated around the petroleum and oil   industries, but have also included heavy and light industries, transportation,   post, aquatic culture, and fishing.<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><sup>68</sup></a> Along these lines, it can be said that   Russia was a pioneer in establishing cooperation with Vietnam which, since   2000, increasingly attracted other international players, such as Mobil, BP,   and TOTAL. Due to their investment in Vietnamese oil and gas exploration, these   actors would possibly be willing to support Vietnam's position in the SCS   disputes.<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><sup>69</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Russia's importance to Hanoi's strategic calculations   is also closely related to the Cam Ranh port. Even though Hanoi has pursued the   policy of "equidistancing" all external actors to the Cam Ranh, Russia stands   out from the other major players in its role as an exporter of military   equipment and technology, which may constitute the basis for fostering closer   military ties between these two countries. Prior to the opening of the port to   other foreign actors, on November 1, 2010, Vietnam declared that there were   plans to hire Russian consultants and to buy Russian technology for the port's   construction and upgrading projects.<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><sup>70</sup></a> This decision of the Vietnamese   government has been seen by agencies like Stratfor as an evidence of the   "favorable conditions for Russian troops to return to the base," hence   supporting the common goal of "preventing and deterring China's growing   aggression in the SCS."<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><sup>71</sup></a> Such interpretation of the role of   Russia in Vietnam's security strategy seems to be the line with the strategic   calculation of the Vietnamese leadership, i.e. Vietnam welcoming Russia's   tangible engagement in regional security issues. The Vietnamese President   Truong Tan Sang asserted that Vietnam's relations with Russia are "bound by   long-term cooperation and strategic partnership. &#91;...&#93; Hence, we will provide   benefits for Russia in Cam Ranh port, including in the field of military   cooperation." Vietnam will thus "allow Russia to set up a ship maintenance base   at its Cam Ranh port."<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><sup>72</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides the traditional emphasis placed by Vietnamese   authorities upon military cooperation with Russia, efforts have been made so as   to engage Russia in the region's security architecture&#151;something that is in   harmony with the relevance that has been ascribed by Hanoi to ASEAN, ARF, and   EAS. Thus, the leaders who gathered at the 5<sup>th</sup> EAS, held in Hanoi in   2010, decided to invite Russia (a full dialogue partner of ASEAN since July 29,   1996)<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><sup>73</sup></a> to participate in this regional   structure. Eventually, the EAS membership was extended to Russia in 2011. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Due to the radically reduced room of maneuver in the   shadow of the rise of China, Vietnam's relations with Russia have acquired   crucial importance to Hanoi. Indeed, these relations represent military   strategic hedging to the extent that such strategies address Vietnam's need for   military modernization. Cooperation with Russia is unique since it allows the   country to prepare for a potential armed conflict in the region while ensuring   national security and interests vis-&agrave;-vis China. At the same time, Russia   enhances its role and influence in the area as a re-emerging power. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Equally important,   Vietnam's military strategic hedging towards Russia is closely connected to its   economic cooperation in oil exploration, which brings significant economic   benefits to both parties. Undoubtedly, Vietnam's hedging towards Russia has   been successful. The stronger military cooperation between these two countries   has enabled Vietnam to acquire modern military equipment, providing the country   with the ability to advance joint explorations of oil and gas in the SCS   despite growing Chinese opposition towards these projects. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion </b></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This article has explored Vietnam's hedging strategy   to cope with the growing power, influence, and presence of China in the region.   It has scrutinized, in particular, the role played by two external   players&#151;Russia and the EU&#151;in Vietnam's hedging against its powerful neighbor.   As the present study has demonstrated, such hedging is especially noticeable in   the strategies adopted by Vietnam in territorial disputes with China.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a relatively small country in terms of bargaining   power, Vietnam believes that the involvement of third parties is needed. This   is all the more apparent as the issue of maritime security in the SCS, as   associated to the freedom and safety of navigation, has become a source of   concern not only for the SCS countries, but also for the rest of the world.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Received December   27, 2012<br />   Approved February   5, 2013</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">1</a>&nbsp; Alena Vysotskaya Guedes Vieira and Laura C.

The strategy focuses on China's military and   economic rise, which, along with the country's cultural and racial superiority,   should secure China's world leadership, to the detriment of the United States   that would lose its dominant position in international politics. The fact that   the book received its approval to be published by the Chinese Communist Party   is symptomatic of the fact that the "peaceful rise" doctrine is by no means the   only one underpinning modern Chinese foreign policy. See <i>Liu Mingfu, Zhongguo Meng: Hou     Meiguo Shidai de DaGuo Siwei yu Zhanl&uuml;e Dingwei</i> &#91;China's Dream:   Major Power Thinking and Strategic Posture in a Post-American Era&#93;, (Beijing:   Zhongguo Youyi Chuban Gongsi &#91;China Friendship Publishing Company&#93;, 2010).   Scholars seem to agree that while Liu's argument "does not represent the   official view of the Chinese Government or the PLA," it is nevertheless   situated "within the bounds of acceptable discourse and probably reflects the   views of a significant number of PLA officers." Saunders, P. C. (2010). Will   China's Dream turn into America's Nightmare?

Vietnam's influence stems from its   both positional and non-positional characteristics. Among these, the following   should be stressed: the size of its population; its geographic position as a   littoral state in such strategically important area as the SCS; and the   (foreign) policy options which the country has adopted over the last   15 years or so in relation to the regional integration initiatives that   allowed Vietnam to punch above its weight. Furthermore, the country has been   modernizing its armed forces for a number of years now. Finally, its economic   performance allows it to be positioned within the group of emerging   middle-income countries. In 2007, the international position of Vietnam has   been further reinforced with the country's election as a non-permanent member   of the United Nations Security Council. Hence, nowadays, Vietnam is recognized   as a key player in ASEAN and in ASEAN-based regional architecture. <br />   <a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11" title="">11</a>&nbsp; Nguyen, V. T. (2000).

The most significant Chinese aid allocation   has been related to infrastructure; in particular, the railway projects, as   well as hydro-power development and ship-building facilities. Chinese   assistance to Vietnam, which corresponds approximately to US$ 200 million&#150;US$ 300 million   loans stands in contrast to the amounts in assistance given to Indonesia and   the Philippines. Thus, the total amount of Chinese funds allocated to the   Philippines reached US$ 5.4 billion between 2002 and 2007. As of   2008, the Philippines were the largest recipient of Chinese loans in Southeast   Asia, which reportedly totaled US$ 2 billion, of which about half has   been already disbursed.

On the other hand, Beijing has stopped the   economic assistance to Vietnam, in 2006, after the Vietnamese government   invited Taiwan, a major investor in the country, to attend the Asia-Pacific   Economic Cooperation (APEC) November 2006 summit in Hanoi.

The gender questions, as they are assumed today by the public in general, have been built by the science discourses. We start by approaching the way the discourse on gender has beenconstructed by modern psychology, i.e., how the concept and the explanatory theories have constructed a meaning that, today, is itself associated with its study. After the "emergence" of the post modernists, post structuralists perspectives and of the critical theory, one now sees the emergence of the critique of conventional paradigms. New questions and new challenges are now raised to psychology and to the traditional research programs, as well as to the study and analysis of the meaning and practices associated to gender.

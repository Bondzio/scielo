Abstract From an archaeological analysis on health articles published between the years of 1950 and 1980, it was described statements and regularities coming from four fields: time, space, development and State. Two discursive modes were identified: on behalf of nation and pro-developmentalism. The former did not declare the claim of rights; the latter associates law, health and development with State and relevant public actions delimitations. This points to the necessity of investigating health discursive strategies since 1980 especially considering the discursive functioning of the statements about law and development because an inflexion of the very notion of law as equality among citizens may have occurred.

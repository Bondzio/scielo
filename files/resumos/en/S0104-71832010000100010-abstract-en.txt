The new eating manners state that, in Spain, there are some simplifications and individualization of meals and an increase in the number of daily intakes. Although these changes would partially support the thesis of the non-structural meals proposed to define the food modernity, our hypothesis suggests that the Spanish eating behaviours have changed and diversified to adapt to the new socioeconomic constrictions imposed by an increasing industrialized society. The food practices observed didn't show any disturbing symptoms of a general dysfunction but instead it showed the eating manners as more operational and flexible.

The present article seeks to understand the uses of the internet as a space for action and reflection among feminist groups in the Brazilian scene. It takes as its focus the relationships between new feminist generations and esthetics and the social space of the internet. Several feminist groups have emphasized the use of the internet and social networks as relevant platforms for organization, news and political expression. I thus take as my object of analysis one of the most important blogs in the Brazilian context: Blogueiras Feministas (Feminist Bloggers - BF), seeking to use this as an ethnographic resource in order to understand the set of actors and collectives working within this feminist scenario, as well as the spaces and social, political and cultural strategies that appear within it.

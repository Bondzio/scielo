Abstract Home gardens have considerable biodiversity conservation potential. However, these spaces are unplanned, and there is little information about the flora diversity in the backyards of different social classes. The current study has quantified and compared plant diversity in the backyards of two neighborhoods located in the metropolitan region of Maringá - RMM (Paraná, Brazil), namely, Conjunto Triangulo and Zona 02. The diversity patterns were markedly different when the neighborhoods were compared. Therefore the present study has set some planning guidelines aiming at increasing the presence of woody vegetation, as well as at contributing to biodiversity conservation, including the conservation of endangered plant species, in the backyards of the RMM.

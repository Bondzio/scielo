Abstract This paper analyzes indicators of social intolerance in Europe. The aims are to test moderation effects between individual and contextual indicators in a multilevel regression model. The data consists in the results of the 2008 wave of the European Value Studies. The hypotheses were tested using HLM software. It was confirmed the existence of two moderating effects: between the feeling of threat and the dimension of the habitat; and between the longevity and the support for democracy. Although the theme of social tolerance has been widely studied, few works had study this phenomenon using multilevel analysis, and is still smaller number of studies that tested moderation effects. It is suggested the search for new effects of moderation on social intolerance predictor models.

The European feminist ebullience in the 70s influenced the formation of several feminist movements composed of Latin-american women living in Europe. In this manuscript, we intend to analize one of the first such groups in France, the Latin-american women's group in Paris. Composed of women from different Latin-american countries, part of them on exile, this group had its first meeting in 1972. It promoted consciousness-raising groups, debates, film projections, and, from January 1974 to the second trimestre of 1976, published the bilingual (Portuguese and Spanish) bulletin Nosotras. We intend to analize how notions like identity, patriarchy, class, among others were approached on this publication.

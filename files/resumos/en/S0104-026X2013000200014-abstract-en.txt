The occasion from twenty years after the Revista Estudos Feministas I seek articulate the debate about social movement theory and to present some of the challenges are put for feminist publications. Dealing of the challenges related to the recognition and sustainability, for publishing lines and on the relationship between university and movement. I conclude by stating that the main challenge is how to articulate feminist publications of the theoretical production and the feminist research with fights and the forms of organization that the feminist movement builds for each historic context.

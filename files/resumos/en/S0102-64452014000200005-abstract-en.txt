This paper aims to investigate the circulation of imagery about "Latin America", produced in several instances of discursive production, between intellectual representatives of film criticism in Brazil during the 1950s and 1960s. Crucial moment of reflexive production around the dilemmas of social, economic, and policies for which the country was, the context was the scene for the emergence of cultural, artistic and intellectual expressions, through which was revealed the dispute over the meaning of the processes of political change underway. The goal of this work is to analyze the debate in which film critics, scholars and filmmakers positioned themselves as the search for political and aesthetics expression that while Latin American identity, was able to make sense of the political leadership of that generation.

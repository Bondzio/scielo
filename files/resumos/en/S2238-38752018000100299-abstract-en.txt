Abstract In this text published in 1977 and written at the suggestion of Florestan Fernandes himself, yet little known to the ample critical literature on the work of the São Paulo sociologist and practically inaccessible today, Silviano Santiago presents an original reading of A revolução burguesa no Brasil. Approaching the work through a prism that remains just as innovative and provocative today, it foregrounds Florestan&#8217;s refusal to adopt a Eurocentric posture by rejecting the reasoning through concepts taken from the social sciences in order, instead, to adopt the operative principle of difference as a mobilizing force of a new critical discourse on the periphery in the periphery. The text is preceded by an introduction in which, rereading the review 40 years later, the author tells the contemporary reader of his encounter with Florestan in the United States and the beginning of a friendship.

Abstract The article deals with some spacialization processes of the religious protestant missions with an ecumenical profile directed to indigenous peoples, taking them as part of the contemporary mechanisms of state building, which includes the administration of territories and populations. It intends to produce a more complex view of some interpretations about the relations between missions and colonial and post-colonial situations, exploring the plurality of their motivations, the diversity of alliances they establish, in different periods of time and geographical settings, as well as the variety of meanings they can transmit. To do so, it exams four cases, in South Korea, Norway, Argentina and Brazil, analysing the connections between missions with local and transnational webs of support, mainly in the field of development cooperation, using a multisited ethnografical approach.

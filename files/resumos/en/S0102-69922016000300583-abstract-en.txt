Abstract The research protocol for cultural and knowledge circulation is alloted into the sociology of culture agendas in Brazil. Under processual point of view, the discursive-epistemic and institutional figurations related to the differentiation of the sociology of culture within the field of Brazilian social sciences are taken as object of knowledge and considerations. Itineraries through the intellectual affiliation alleys are drawn while describing what is here assumed as heuristic elements of their respective conceptual tools framework. Three stages are analyzed: (1) the sociological approach focused in the modernist problem of the public image of the intellectual confined under the circumstances of a peripheral dependent capitalist society; (2) the analytical reorientation in which the perspectives of the cultural industry achieves significant importance in the formulations on the symbolic production, particularly with regard to conceptions of Brazilian modernity; (3) the possibilities considered through the lens of mundialization are recovered in order to draw an non-exhaustive picture of what we understand as possibilities of the cultural circulation and knowledge protocols.

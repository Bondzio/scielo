In this essay we explore the specificities of the travels and translations of feminist theories, taking into consideration the mediations carried out by cultural magazines and scientific journals. We discuss how a feminist canon is constructed through transnational citation practices, and conclude with some examples of publications that are openning up spaces for the construction of new feminist knowledges through conter-translation practices.

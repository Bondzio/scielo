Abstract This article comprises a very brief introduction to a Portuguese translation of a text by the German thinker Georg Simmel. For this introduction, I adopt the assumption that this is a key text to a due comprehension of Simmel's sociological accomplishments. I aim here to indicate - but only in rather a sketchy manner - the placement of such text along the lines of Simmel's intellectual trajectory. In order to do so, I point to some chronological and thematic relations between this text and some of the others he wrote. I propose, as a sort of conclusion, that the text should be read as a mature essay on social theory.

Abstract The paper presents a methodological proposal in the form of a framework for redesigning informal settlements based on Low-impact Design and Development methodology. It involves the management of rainwater through the implementation of urban infrastructure on local scale in a decentralized and collaborative manner. It served as an object of study the region of Baixada de Jacarepagua, a vector of expansion of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The proposed framework adopts Action-Research methodology. The stages envisaged in the framework are: (i) initial, which involves approaching the community, establishing bonds and setting up a management group, (ii) diagnosis, and (iii) project. The application of the framework is demonstrated by means of a case study of the community, which typifies the slums in areas of marshland and the peripheral urban landscape. It is believed that this framework can guide the urban redesign of other communities within the perspective of sustainable development.

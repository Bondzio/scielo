This paper explores the World Bank's view of early childhood as an example of the globalization of childhood. It argues that globalization is characterized by a particular neo-liberal economic approach which exacerbates the gap between rich and poor nations and between the rich and poor within countries; and by a technological/scientific optimism which stresses the benefits of technological interventions. It traces how these two aspects of globalization have influenced the policies towards young children that the World Bank is now actively promoting. It will draw on evidence presented by the World Bank to illustrate the contradictions inherent in such an approach.

Abstract The main continuities and ruptures between shamanism and neo-shamanism are analyzed, describing the forms through which images of the shamanic Other, powerful, have been constructed in specific relation with the ideas of Nature and Healing. It is argued that the teacher plants are the paradigm of the intersection of both components and the most effective, seductive and expansionist technique of neo-shamanism, observed within the framework of the dynamics of modernity/coloniality.Finally, the text presents some specific discursive strategies within the neo-shamanic domain that force to refine and to deepen the analyses on the neo-shamanism.

This study examines the relationship between male and female participation in the Centro dos Professores do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul - CPERS/Sindicato (Center of Educators in the State of Rio Grande do Sul - CPERS/Union), comparing membership and presence in the board of directors according to sex, to find out whether women's situation in this union is different from those of other class union boards of directors, composed mostly of men. It discusses the small social and political participation of women and shows some figures on educators and gender in Brazil. The findings indicate a men vs. women proportionality inversion in the category base compared to the board of directors, in such a way that, although women are well represented in this union, men are the ones who occupy positions of greater power and prestige, such as the board. Finally, considering the fact that union activity is dominated by a male bias, one wonders whether the union is able to follow the possible changes in educators' identity based on the category image it has.

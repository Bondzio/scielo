Abstract Where there is citizenship, there is a constitution. So, State duties are defined and its limits are established. In liberal democratic canon, one of these limits prescribes a strict separation between State and Economy. Liberal constitutionalism, thus, focus on the constraints on State intervention in economy, whereas Social constitutionalism has been dedicated to the challenge of enforcing social and economic rights. In our central hypothesis we argue the need of widening economic constitutionalism having in mind experiences of epistemic injustice (Santos, 2014). From a bottom-up perspective, we mean bringing to light initiatives engendered and led by women from and in Mozambique, South Africa and Brazil that come with new rationalities to the moral and political practice, which question the founding principles of the economic functionalism and the narrative of national progress foreseen within the Constitutions. Our research discusses as well the effective impact of these socio-economies in the issue of social transformations and the advancing of economic citizenship.

The main objective of this article is to discuss the use of video recordings of classes with professors enrolled in continuous education training courses as a strategy to facilitate these teachers reflecting on their classes. The innovation that proposed in our course was to bring the teachers' classes into our meetings. In making the teachers discuss and reflect on their own activities, we provided the opportunity for them to question and to become conscious of their own concepts about different aspects of teaching and of apprenticeship. The data from the research realized during the continued training course are analyzed.

Abstract This article discusses the conditions for the emergence and the effects of the literacy anticipation device that changes the age at which literacy must be consolidated to the first year of elementary school. It is argued that, historically, a device was engineered that articulated different discussions, scientific statements, laws, and philosophical, legal and moral propositions that have, as their effect in the schools, the requirement that children be literate in the first year of elementary school. The discussion about maturity, the studies on the psychogenesis of writing and literacy are analyzed herein as discursive practices that provided the conditions for the emergence of a device which anticipates not only the entrance into elementary school, but also the requirement of the full literacy of these children.

Without intending to exhaust the extensive literature on sex and gender product of recent decades, we intend to limit ourselves only to highlight certain aspects of Connell's work "Gender and Power. Society, the Person and Sexual Politics" (1987), especially those that make the relationship between gender, practice and social structure. In this work we will put Connel in dialogue with another author, Pierre Bourdieu, who printed provocative positions with respect to this conceptual tripod: gender, social structure and practice. The dialogue will be critical and tense between the two authors. Finally, the article outlines a way of understanding the human being from what we have called masculinization strategies.

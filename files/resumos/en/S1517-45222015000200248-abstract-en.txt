In 1991, Quebec became autonomous for defining its own migratory policies. Recruiting and selecting immigrants became part of a process that while opening Quebec to the world, was also concerned with building a French province image inside Canada through the fait français.However, integrating new immigrants also brought some challenges. The Quebec policies were meant to classify those new immigrants in the categories of cultural communities or visible minorities.After Latin America has been defined as a new area of immigration the flow of Brazilians increased 640% between 2006-2011.Data collected through interviews with Brazilian immigrants in Quebec showed that they felt rather reluctant regarding being defined as a Latin American visible minority and to join the fait français. At the same time, they tried to establish some elements that would put them closer to the local culture. The analyses of the migratory paths also showed that the demand for Canadian citizenship is a strong component of acquiring a capital of mobility,which promotes integration but, paradoxically, allows further migrations.

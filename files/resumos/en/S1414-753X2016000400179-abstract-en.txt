Abstract In theoretical and empirical terms, the climate change is seen in the current study as a set of themes containing the perspective of "coming to occur in a near future". However, thinking about the Island State of Tuvalu as a possible illustrative example of the direct occurrence of climate change adds a new analytical perspective to the existing literature, because the inversion from "coming to occur" to "is occurring" may change the resolution focus and give visibility to the affected ones. The aim of the current study is to reflect about the Tuvaluan climate change case based on literature review and documentary research and anchored on Political Theory and Sociology authors who use citizenship, human rights and sovereignty as research themes. It is concluded that Tuvalu illustrates the understanding of climate change and is a probable case of "non-future" for the unassisted ones.

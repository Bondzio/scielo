This article aims to study the National Programme for Strengthening Family Agriculture (Pronaf) in their credit lines for costing and investment, in order to investigate their relationships and interfaces with the family farm, using it for a study in Rio Grande do Sul (Middle High Uruguay microregion). The question to be answered is: what kind of building that is generating Pronaf with family farmers? To do this, it was used a methodology based on qualitative, using semi-structured interviews and underpinned by arguments with secondary data from various sources and research. It is concluded that the program has a dual logic. On the one hand, it is financing production activities usual for farmers, such as grain and agricultural commodities. On the other hand, there is a process of economic diversification of productive activities, small livestock, crops and basic food for household consumption.

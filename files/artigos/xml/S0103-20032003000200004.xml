<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2">This article analyzes the effectiveness of hedging    Brazilian soy oil, soy meal, and soybeans in the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)    and in the Brazilian Commodities and Futures Exchange (BM&amp;F) to reduce the    risk of financial loss due to commodity price fluctuations. The econometric    results show that a cross-hedging strategy using the BM&amp;F soybean futures    contract is an instrument of low effectiveness for managing soy oil and soy    meal price risk. Despite low effectiveness, the estimates demonstrate total    advantage for soy meal hedging operations using CBOT soy meal futures contracts    rather than cross-hedging using BM&amp;F soybean futures contracts. With some    exceptions, the results are also more favorable for hedging soy oil with soy    oil futures contracts at the CBOT rather than cross hedging with soybeans at    the BM&amp;F. Conversely, Brazilian traders hedging soybeans receive more effective    risk protection by trading soybean futures contracts at the BM&amp;F than by    trading soybean futures contracts at the CBOT.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><b>Key words</B>: cross-hedging, soybean industry,    hedging effectiveness.</font></p>   <hr noshade size="1">     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>1. Introduction </b></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Agricultural futures contracts have become important    tools for the management of price risk. By means of the purchase or sale of    these contracts while holding opposite positions in the physical market, farmers,    agribusiness managers, grain elevators operators, and international traders    are protected against adverse price variation. This strategy, known as hedging,    is based on the correlation between the price negotiated for a commodity’s futures    contract and the cash price of the same commodity. If the current and future    prices are correlated, the financial loss in one market (future or current)    tends to be, at least partially, compensated for by the earnings obtained from    holding the opposite position in the other market.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The soybean complex is among the sectors of the    Brazilian economy that demand careful administration to control financial risk.    Several facts illustrate the importance of this sector in the Brazilian economy.    Brazil is now the world second largest producer of soybeans and the largest    exporter of soybean meal. Brazilian exports of the complex’s principal products    (beans, oil, and meal) reached more than US $4 billion in 2000, which corresponds    to about 8% of the country’s total export value. In 2001, the value of the soy    product exports increased to US$ 5.297 billion (ABIOVE).</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">In spite of the expressive performance reflected    in the numbers shown above, traders who operate with soybeans and soybean products    are still in need of the same risk management tools that are available to their    main competitors, the North Americans. In the United States, specific futures    contracts are available for each of the soybean complex’s products at the CBOT,    while the Brazilian exchange only offers soybean futures contracts. To make    this situation even worse, trade of soybean futures contracts at the BM&amp;F,    which was already quite small in relation to the number of contracts negotiated    at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), drastically diminished after 1999 (<a href="#fig1">Figure    1</a>) and was interrupted in 2001. Due to this situation, evidenced in <a href="#fig1">Figure    1</a>, the BM&amp;F reformulated its soybeans futures contract operations in    2002 to attract more investors and generate the liquidity necessary for market    operations.</font></p>     <p><a name="fig1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a4f1i.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">An issue that arises in this setting is whether    the BM&amp;F soybean futures market meets the liquidity requirements and offers    the products needed to reduce risk. In other words, does the BM&amp;F soybean    futures market allow risk reductions similar to the risk reductions that Brazilian    hedgers would obtain using CBOT soy futures contracts? The answer to this question    not only reflects the past value of BM&amp;F futures contracts, but also gives    an indication of the reformulated contract’s potential effectiveness as a hedging    tool.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Although hedges are normally made with futures    contracts for the same commodity being traded in the spot market, specific futures    contracts for a given commodity are not always obtainable. The unavailability    of futures contracts for all commodities leads to the use of futures contracts    underpinned by commodities merely related to the one for which risk protection    is intended: cross-hedging. Only soybean futures contracts are available in    the BM&amp;F. The soybean complex’s multi-dimensional product mix makes hedging    in the Brazilian market more difficult, as cross-hedging is often the only available    hedging option.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Using BM&amp;F futures contracts, traders can    hedge current soybean positions with soybean futures contracts; however, traders    wishing to hedge current positions in soy oil or meal must cross hedge with    soybean futures contracts. These same traders can directly hedge any of their    current soy product positions using the soybean, meal, and oil futures contracts    available in international exchanges, such as the CBOT. As the three soy products’    prices can move in different directions and intensities, the effectiveness of    a soy product cross-hedging strategy is reduced. Therefore, the viability of    any soy product cross-hedging strategy should be evaluated empirically case    by case.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The objective of this paper is to compare alternative    hedging strategies for traders of soybeans, soy oil, and soy meal from the main    Brazilian producer regions. The alternative strategies are defined by the use    of either BM&amp;F or CBOT soy product futures contracts as the hedge. The period    of analysis runs from 1998 to 2000, just before the drastic reduction in Brazilian    contract trading. A comparative analysis between the soybean contracts traded    at the BM&amp;F and CBOT has already been conducted by Lazzarini (1997). The    author’s study employed statistical tests to measure the effectiveness of the    direct hedge in the two exchanges and verified an advantage gained through use    of the Brazilian exchange. Our work differs from Lazzarini’s (1997) in the period    and regions considered and in the inclusion of soy oil and meal in the analysis.    In addition, our paper uses more current econometric methodology.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The paper is organized in three sections besides    this introduction. The next section, section 2, presents the portfolio theory    that was applied to the futures markets and empiric procedures employed. Section    3 reports and discusses the empirical results, and section 4, the final section,    offers our conclusions.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>2.

The series    begins in 1998 because the series of cash prices was first generated in 1998.    FNP Consultoria e Pesquisa’s database provided the exchange rate series and    the daily wholesale prices of soybeans (R$ per 60kg bag), soy meal (R$/ton),    and soy oil (R$ per ton) in the Brazilian states of Bahia (Barreiras), Paran&aacute;    (Cascavel, Campo Mour&atilde;o, Maring&aacute; and Ponta Grossa), Mato Grosso    (Cuiab&aacute; and Rondon&oacute;polis), Rio Grande do Sul (Passo Fundo), Santa    Catarina (Chapec&oacute;), Minas Gerais (Uberl&acirc;ndia), Goi&aacute;s (Rio    Verde), Mato Grosso do Sul (Dourados) and S&atilde;o Paulo (Orl&acirc;ndia).    Since these 13 regions were chosen to achieve results for Brazil as a whole,    they include regions that are not among the country’s most important soy producing    regions. Soybean futures prices in Brazil (in US$/60kg bag) were obtained from    the BM&amp;F; futures prices of oil (US cents/lb), meal (US$/ton) and soybeans    (cents/bushel) at the CBOT were obtained from the database of Consultoria, M&eacute;todos,    Assessoria e Mercantil LTDA- CMA. All the price series were converted to US$/ton.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The futures price series were constructed using    the date of contract expiration (the first delivery date) at the CBOT as the    base date. As contract expiration at the CBOT occurs on the 15<SUP>th</SUP>    day of each delivery month, that day was used as the base date at both the CBOT    and the BM&amp;F. After the date of contract expiration was rationalized between    the two markets, weekly series (112 observations) and biweekly series (56 observations)    were organized using every Wednesday’s data. Wednesday was chosen because it    is the most active trading day in both exchanges. If Wednesday was a holiday,    the preceding Tuesday or following Thursday was substituted.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">After the series were built, unit root tests    were carried out to verify if they were stationary.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2">The table shows that the effectiveness of cross-hedging    a position in soy oil with BM&amp;F soybean futures contracts varies by region    from 3.7% to 30.17% (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, col.7). These low optimum    effectiveness values indicate that this cross-hedging operation is an unappealing    risk protection option. At the highest effectiveness level, the case of the    trader operating with soy oil from Maring&aacute;, cross-hedging soy oil using    BM&amp;F soybean futures contracts at the at the optimum calculated hedge ratio    of 2.08 (a trader wanting protection for 1,000 t of soy oil held in the physical    market is optimally cross hedged by selling soybean futures contracts totaling    2,080 t in the BM&amp;F) would remove only 30.17% of his risk of financial loss    due to negative price fluctuations. The relatively high optimum hedge ratio    further reduces this hedging strategy’s appeal, as the number of futures contracts    that must be traded to reach this ratio greatly increases costs. In general,    similar behavior was found in all analyzed regions: high optimum hedge ratios    and low hedging effectiveness make cross hedging soy oil in the BM&amp;F an    uninteresting risk management strategy.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Soy meal traders looking for risk protection    through use of BM&amp;F soybean futures contracts would also be disappointed.    This hedging strategy had a degree of regional effectiveness that varied from    a very unhelpful negative 12.66% to an only slightly better <a name="vnota4"></a>14.58%<a href="#nota4"><sup>4</sup></a>. As with    soy oil, the correlation between soybean price and soy meal prices was not great    enough to make cross-hedging at the BM&amp;F advantageous.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">For soybean traders, the effectiveness of hedging    at the BM&amp;F varies from 44.61% to 84.38%, depending on region, on average    quite superior to the estimates for oil and meal cross-hedging. Focusing on    the highest and lowest effectiveness values for the hedging soybeans with BM&amp;F    soybean futures contracts, a trader located in Cascavel with a position in the    physical market of 1000 60 kg bags of soybeans would have to negotiate the equivalent    of 765 bags (.765 optimum ratio) in the futures market to gain a risk reduction    as large as 84%, while a trader located in Orl&acirc;ndia, holding the same    position of 1000 bags in the physical market would have to negotiate 408 bags    in the futures market to obtain a risk reduction of (just) about 45%. In general,    this hedging strategy permitted risk reduction above 60% in all regions except    Campo Mour&atilde;o and Orl&acirc;ndia. It is interesting to note that the least    effective hedge was found to be in Orl&acirc;ndia, which is in the state where    the BM&amp;F is located.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The results from the BM&amp;F weekly prices series    suggest that the design of this exchange’s soybean futures contract matched    most of Brazil’s regional soybean markets and is an appropriate instrument for    use by soybean traders in the Brazilian market to reduce price risk. The same    cannot be said about cross-hedging either soy meal or oil holdings with BM&amp;F    soybean futures contracts; these risk reduction strategies were shown to be    unviable.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2"><i>3.1.2 CBOT</i></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Analysis of the results of hedging Brazilian    soybean positions with CBOT soybean futures contracts (<a href="#tab2">Table    2</a>) shows that this strategy is less effective than hedging the same product    using BM&amp;F soybean futures contracts. Ponta Grossa was the only region with    CBOT hedging effectiveness superior to 50%, which does not compare well with    the 83.57% effectiveness of the same hedge using BM&amp;F futures contracts.    This result leads to the assumption that the BM&amp;F soybean futures contract    reflects the Brazilian domestic soybean market’s characteristics better than    the CBOT contract. Notice that even the low volume of trade in the BM&amp;F    contract was not sufficient to impede a high price correlation between the Brazilian    soybean cash and futures markets.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab2"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/resr/v41n2/a4t2i.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

Results Summary</i></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="verdana" size="2">The estimates made using biweekly data were very    similar to the ones generated using weekly observations except in the case of    the soy oil hedge. This general similarity brings more consistency to the following    summary of the results. In the case of soybeans, the relationship between cash    and futures prices favored the domestic exchange. The effectiveness of the soybean    hedge with the BM&amp;F soybean futures contract was about 36% superior to the    effectiveness of a hedge with the CBOT soybean contract.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Soy meal hedging using the CBOT meal futures    contract was consistently found to be a more effective risk reduction strategy    than cross hedging soy meal with soybeans at the BM&amp;F. The series of soy    meal hedges with CBOT meal futures contracts shows that meal traders in the    studied regions gained at best an average risk reduction of 42% with a small    optimum ratio and minimal interregional variation.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">There was divergence between the biweekly and    the weekly soy oil hedging results. The biweekly series shows that, in 77% of    the regions, soy oil hedging at the CBOT reduces risk more effectively than    cross hedging at the BM&amp;F, however, the weekly series shows just the opposite    to be true: the BM&amp;F soy oil cross hedge offers more effective risk protection    in 70% of the regions. This apparent contradiction suggests that one    need be careful when broadly assuming that one hedging strategy offers better    risk protection than another in that market. In addition, it should    be noted that the optimum ratios needed to effect the most efficient BM&amp;F    soy oil hedging strategies are extremely high in almost all regions in both    series, which makes this strategy’s cost effectiveness a concern.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The CBOT soy oil futures hedge for Orl&acirc;ndia    oil traders was the most effective CBOT hedge (63% risk reduction in the biweekly    series) and more effective than any BM&amp;F cross hedge, but at the best, oil    traders in the studied regions gained an average risk reduction of only 37%    at the CBOT with extreme interregional variation (<a href="#tab4">Table 4</a>).    What can be taken from the soy oil hedging analysis is that both hedging    and cross hedging in the soy oil market do not reduce price risk substantially.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The following three generalizations are therefore    made:</font></p>       <blockquote>      <li>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The BM&amp;F’s soybean futures contract is      more effective than the CBOT’s for hedging soybean positions in the studied      regions. Average soybean risk protection provided by the BM&amp;F contract      reached its peak of 76% in the biweekly series. The CBOT soybean contract’s      average protection peaked at 40% in the same series. Futures prices in the      BM&amp;F stayed strongly correlated with the cash prices in most of Brazil’s      soybean producing regions.</font></p>       <li>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Brazilian soy meal hedging using the CBOT soy      meal futures contract was found to be clearly more effective than cross-hedging      using the BM&amp;F soybean futures contract, but the effectiveness of the      hedge using the CBOT contract is still quite low. The effectiveness of the      CBOT hedge rose above 60% in only two regions: Maring&aacute;, and Ponta Grossa      in the state of Paran&aacute;.</font></p>       ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<li>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Hedging Brazilian soy oil with either of the      strategies analyzed in this research was not a particularly effective method      of managing the risk of soy oil price fluctuation. Soy oil hedging at the      CBOT did prove to be a more effective risk reduction strategy than cross hedging      at the BM&amp;F, at least in biweekly series, but the possible benefits from      hedging soy oil at the CBOT are small, except possibly for those trading soy      oil in Orl&acirc;ndia.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p>&nbsp;</p>       <p><font face="verdana" size="3"><b>4. Conclusions </b></font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">This paper shows that the soybean futures contract    traded at the BM&amp;F can be of great usefulness to farmers, cooperatives,    agro-industries, exporters and other agents in the Brazilian soy market for    the management of their price risk, in spite of the low volume of trade in this    contract over recent years. Soybean hedging in the BM&amp;F futures market was    found to be a more attractive option than soybean hedging at the CBOT, offering    average price risk protection across all regions of 76% in the biweekly series.    It was also determined that Brazilian soy oil and soy meal cross hedges with    BM&amp;F soybean futures contracts had very little effect on price risk; moreover,    except in a very few of the studied regions, hedging Brazilian oil or meal with    oil or meal futures contracts at the CBOT also had little effect.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Although it is known that high trade volume contributes    to a greater correlation between cash and futures prices, which is essential    for hedging operations to be effective, the results reported in this analysis    suggest that the correlation between the cash and futures prices of Brazilian    soybeans was greater in the BM&amp;F than in the CBOT. In other words, the similarity-effect,    which is the effect of similarity between the characteristics of the cash market    and the contractual design of the futures market overcame the liquidity-effect,    which tends make the greatest price correlation a result of the more efficient    arbitrage available in larger liquidity markets. However, the results obtained    by the soybeans hedgers in the BM&amp;F would even be better if contract trade    at the BM&amp;F was more liquid.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">Increased trading volume not only improves the    correlation between cash and future prices but should also reduce transaction    costs and facilitate the close of positions for traders who do not want delivery.    These benefits may spill over into soybean product cross hedges, making that    price risk protection strategy more attractive. In the final analysis, the study’s    results show that Brazilian soybean product traders would benefit from the growth    of the Brazilian soybean futures market. Soybean traders certainly would as    they get quite inferior protection in the Chicago commodities futures exchange</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">It is not so apparent that speculators operating    in the Brazilian soybean market benefit from hedging at the Brazilian commodity    futures exchange. This exchange’s illiquidity puts off many speculators fearing    that they will not be able to offset their positions when they want to leave    the market. The drastic reduction in trade volume in the BM&amp;F’s soybean    futures market when contractual reformatting eliminated the cash settlement    rule made this evident. The cash settlement rule provided speculators with security;    although, it was undesirable from a traders’ viewpoint.</font></p>     <p><font face="verdana" size="2">The key for the success of a futures contract    is in its design, which must be attractive to both traders looking to protect    their investment and speculators hoping to make a quick paper profit and get    out of the market. If this balance is reached, the vicious cycle of low liquidity    will be ended and all parties will win.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

This study aims to investigate the level of implicit productivity associated with exports of each product of agribusiness and the sophistication revealed of exports baskets of agribusiness products to the Southern Cone countries and the multiplier effects on the generation of agricultural income, product and occupation, in the period from 1992-2009. To calculate the implied productivity index and the revealed sophistication, the method developed by Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2005) was used, and to estimate the multiplier effect of the sophistication of the export basket to socioeconomic variables, the analysis of multiple regression was used. It is possible to say that the results confirm the hypothesis of the more sophisticated exports of the products of agribusiness of Southern Cone countries, the greater the effects of income growth and the multiplier effect (spillovers) for the economies of countries. However, ceteris paribus, to export agribusiness products implicitly associated with the higher income level constitutes an important strategy for accelerated growth, based on exports, and for achieving higher levels of welfare in the region.

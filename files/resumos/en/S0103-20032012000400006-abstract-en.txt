The purpose of this study was to examine the governance structures established throughout the Local Arrangement Productive of Grains in Santarém and Belterra, from interactions between the institutional environment and social actors, and commercial transactions occurring in the arrangement. Data were collected through structured questionnaire, which was applied to 20 grain producers, and the analysis of results was developed from Williamson (1993), Williamson (1999), Humphrey and Schmitz (2000), Kaplinsky (2000) and Schmitz (2000). Results show that governance throughout the chain occurs with the leadership of Cargill Agrícola S/A company, and that the executive governance developed by growers occurs without an entrepreneurial action, which hinders the creation of sustainable competitive advantages in the long-term.

Abstract: In the Portuguese society of the Old Regime, sex between women was susceptible to the death penalty at the stake and, as a mixed crime, was also under the jurisdiction of the Inquisition Tribunal. The objective of this study is to analyze the inquisitorial process of the young Clara Fernandes sentenced, in 1556, by sodomy foeminarum. Although married and the mother of three children, Clara&#8217;s attitudes express an unconstrained sexual desire for women. Tormented by her &#8220;guilts&#8221; sought pardon of the Holy Office, but found the &#8220;justice&#8221; of an inclement Tribunal.

Abstract The water crisis tends to intensify the use of groundwater, which supplies almost half of Brazilian population. Despite that, its management is precarious. The article analyses the role of groundwater and its management in the current context of water crisis and forward the need to ensure the human right to water. The methodology used is the documentary analysis of literature, legislation, international documents and governmental reports. The fragilities over management and the private appropriation of groundwater threaten water security. The water crises focus in the idea of scarcity stimulates the quest for new sources but does not face the structural flaws of the management models. So the use of aquifers reflects the same problems that have allowed the degradation of surface waters, which is aggravated by the hidden character and the irregular exploration.

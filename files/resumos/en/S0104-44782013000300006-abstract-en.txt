The topic analysed in this article is the interest associations Argentine in the industrial developmentalism period. We emphasize the involvement of industrial organizations in the political conflicts and in turn to study how impact these conflicts internally. The research was conducted based on the journals and documents of associations, to which we add the tracking in newspapers and general interest publications. The data obtained here were tested by the method of qualitative analysis. It shows a close dependence between the organizations of the political system and a political crisis in those years. We have also seen that despite political and organizational differences between them we didn&#8217;t found a favorable business sector and other industrial development contrary to it. Our idea was therefore to show that there wasn&#8217;t a radical contrast between a UIA. anti-industry. and CGE pro-industry, contrast that is usually accepted in several studies related to the issue. Finally it seeks to overcome the tendency to think in terms of absolute contradiction actors within Argentine political and social historiography.

Abstract This paper addresses some of the major issues of feminist theories of the 1970s: the problem of the history of literature and the history of film, the canon and the imputed value to artistic works. I attempt to understand the strategies adopted by feminists to combat the construction of the canon that is not an attempt to destroy the literary canon or the cinematic canon, but an effort to make the inclusion of other possible histories from other epistemologys and onthologys.

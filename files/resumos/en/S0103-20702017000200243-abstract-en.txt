Abstract This text is in order that we understand to be the main theoretical legacy of Bourdieu to the sociological study of sport, namely the systematization of a modus operandi that allows us to understand the structure of this practice as a field governed by laws of supply and demand, and in the wake of this investigative line, demonstrating how sport is appropriate from a peculiar symbolic economy that updates the divisions of the social world and often reinforces mechanisms of domination. To account for this analysis, the text was divided into three areas of discussion. In the first part of the paper we recover a theoretical framework that encouraged the development of Bourdieu&#8217;s sociological. In the second analytical block, it tries to restore the way the sport was conceived by Bourdieu as a sociological problem. Finally, we recover some criticism directed at Bourdieu&#8217;s sociological reference to the literature and suggest that an inventive appropriation of his theoretical model may be useful to interpret some sporting processes carried out in modern society.

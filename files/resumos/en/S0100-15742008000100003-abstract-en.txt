This study characterized adolescents who attended programs for young offenders in a city located at SÃ£o Paulo state. A total of 123 protocols pertaining to the year 2002 were analyzed. Cross-data analysis showed that not attending school was related to increasing numbers of criminal re-incidence, use of drugs and of weapons. In addition, participants with higher educational level lived with both parents, while low schooling adolescents lived with single-parent families. Considering that school attendance reduced the severity of delinquent acts as well as the use of weapons and drugs, it is important to face the challenge of keeping these adolescents within the school system, instead of forcing them out.

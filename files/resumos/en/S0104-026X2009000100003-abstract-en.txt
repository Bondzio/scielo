In this article, we have attempted to analyze how comprehensiveness started to be used as a reference in the women's health field, from the current proposal put forward by PNAISM - Política Nacional de Atenção Integral à Saúde da Mulher (National Public Women´s Health). We have aimed at problematizing what we have understood as comprehensiveness in the effectiveness of care in relation to the woman's health. We have used an excerpt of the introductory text produced by the State Health Department in its homepage on Internet, as an exercise to circumscribe this issue. This extract has been divided in three parts. Each one of them has been discussed considering an axis of formulations to problematize comprehensiveness: the woman as a subject of health, the PAISM - Programa de Assistência Integral à Saúde da Mulher (Woman's Health Comprehensive Assistance Program) as conformation of a certain health field for women, and the production of scientific knowledge for the practice in the field of Public Health.

Abstract The evaluation of artistic work as an integral part of the contemporary sociological context imposes that the recovery of the environment of cultural policies is a factor that influences the conditions of this type of craft. The main concern is to recover the historical trajectory of sectoral policies to understand they act upon production, distribution and consumption of cultural activities given the increasing participation of companies in funding artistic work today. It is a matter of mapping the attempt to build the institutionality of the cultural area in Brazil, along with its legal and discursive apparatus that reflects a project implementing governmental actions, informing the course and place of the State in the field of culture.

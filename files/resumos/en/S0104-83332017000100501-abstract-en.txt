Abstract This study explores how transnational motherhood is experienced by a group of Brazilian women participating in the global care chain. Our analysis indicates that transnational motherhood is an experience ripe with contradictions and emotional constraints. On one hand, transnational motherhood can subjugate women for not conforming to conventional motherhood norms. On the other hand, the migratory experience allows women to (re)negotiate their maternal roles, producing new meanings for care and mothering practices.

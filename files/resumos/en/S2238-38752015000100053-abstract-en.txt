Abstract How did Georg Simmel, the "first sociologist of modernity" according to David Frisby, get to know and to conceive modernity? We believe that this happened during the phase in which the author participated in Naturalism - a social movement that had a strong impact on German society and culture. We argue that Simmel was strongly influenced by Naturalism, as many aspects of his theoretical and methodological ideas depend directly on the concept of modernity in the sense given to it by Naturalism.

abstract The relationships between the social division of labor and social stratification are regarded as the key explanatory nexus of recent changes in income distribution in Brazil. The paper highlights the role of class divisions at the level of the job structure, to which are added status groups, segmentation factors and educational credentials. The determinants in question capture changes in the socially organized dimensions of the distribution of rewards. Reductions in the spatial, sectorial and educational inequalities are acknowledged. The inequalities in social status wane, showing contradictory signals. The class conditionings on income remain robust, but show differentiated and nuanced effects amidst the reductions in aggregate income inequality.

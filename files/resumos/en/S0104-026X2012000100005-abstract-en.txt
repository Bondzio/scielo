This article studies the impact of the International Women's Year (1975) in Argentina. Its main activity was an International Conference which took place in Mexico City between June, 19 and July, 2. At that moment, Argentina was going though a time of strong political conflict, a time embedded between two fierce dictatorships (1966-1973 y 1976-1983). It is a topic which has not been so much visible in historiographical studies and that this article considers together with the invocation of women's rights as a disputable political cause. The invitation addressed by the UN made women more visible as individuals with their own demands. The analysis of this topic helps evidence the limits and unwillingness of the State and of some women and women's groups to embrace those demands.

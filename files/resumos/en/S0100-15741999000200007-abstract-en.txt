The article discusses some of the relationships between demographic dynamics and the Population's educational level, using the literacy rate as a basis. It demonstrates that the evolution of total literacy rates over time depends on the age groupings within the population and the capacity of the educational system to form literate individuals at all levels. Based on an analysis of literacy rate projections up to the year 2020, it concludes that the present rate of growth is slow and that an increase depends on taking measures related to education for adults and youth.

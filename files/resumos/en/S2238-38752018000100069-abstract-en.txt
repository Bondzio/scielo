Abstract This article analyses the international circulation of the work of sociologist Florestan Fernandes &#8722; an aspect that has been somewhat overlooked. The paper focuses on three aspects of this problem: (1) it highlights the singularities of the international circulation of Fernandes&#8217;s work vis-Ã -vis the modal trajectory of the scholars who led the formation of the discipline in Latin America; (2) it analyses his publications in foreign journals, his participation in international scientific events, and the reviews of his works made outside Brazil, data from which is used to map the international circulation of his work; (3) in order to explain the case of Florestan Fernandes, it offers some explanatory hypotheses focused on the conceptual distinction between the terms &#8216;internationalization&#8217; and &#8216;international circulation.&#8217; Finally, the article makes some suggestions concerning the impact of the international circulation of Fernandes&#8217;s work on his own sociological theorization of the peculiarities of Latin America.

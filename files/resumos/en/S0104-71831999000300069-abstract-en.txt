In this article I discuss an anthropological approach of narrative as a form of interpretation of collective and personal experience and as a vehicle of sense. The discussion has as backdrop a study about new religious and therapeutic cultures in Brazil, where we approach the person, her experience and meanings of these experiences. The reflection is based in two forms of narrative that has arisen from the fieldwork: therapeutic and autobiographical narratives. The personal dimension, central in narratives related by &#8220;Aquarius children&#8221; about their spiritual itineraries, found in the middle of the narratives, another dimension: that one who speaks about the experience and their social meanings.

What is the point of dealing with the relationship between the visual arts and Feminisms today? What are the possible effects of this discussion for contemporary art teaching? These and other questions permeate this article, which intends to bring to the fore a still marginal topic, almost invisible amidst our main pedagogical concerns related to art and education, arising also from the few or scarce theoretical texts about it, especially the ones written in Portuguese. The discussions presented in this article emerge mainly from researches made by Loponte (2002, 2005, 2008, 2010) and Coutinho (2010, 2011). By raising questions that intertwine the visual arts and Feminisms or the idea of art pervaded by Feminist intentions, we propose a more attentive view of pedagogical practices that are not exempt from the inclusion of such discussions, but still seem to be lethargic around these and more provocative and deconditioning approaches in the school context. We initially present the discussion intertwining contemporary art, Feminisms and female artists, indicating some of the ways of thinking around this relationship. We also approach the erosion of the Feminist adjective as related to the visual arts to, finally, point out pedagogical contradictions and implications in the connections between art and Feminism. In this sense, we intend to call attention to the need of critical analyses involving a work turned towards education about art produced by contemporary women artists in the school environment, presenting a few arguments in favor of this educational task.

Over the last decade, a vulnerability management model in which the family was positioned as the central agent of social policy has been consolidated in Chile. A qualitative study regarding home intervention practices and home assistance management programs support the view that these policies transform and shape family dynamics, in a gender-related way. Analyzing three dispositive acts, which are characteristic of this type of policies, - to focus, to transfer and to visit - , it can be highlighted how the intervention produces and induces valuations of the place assigned to gender and the mode families organize their social relations "behind closed doors".

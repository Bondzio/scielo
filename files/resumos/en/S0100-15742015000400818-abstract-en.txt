The purpose of this essay is to discuss some consequences of productivism, which the academic community has been going through, in recent years. More specifically, we will consider and reflect on two episodes of evaluation of scientific work in the field of education. After outlining a brief introduction, we proceed to the analysis, pointing out ideas and dilemmas worth debating. We conclude by considering the openness to the other as an exercise in which we experience our own decision making symmetrically to the otherÂ´s decision making, as a practice of negotiation. The plurality of ideas is a fundamental presupposition and we consider evaluator and reader as an agonistic pair that is guided by plausible arguments: both need to recognize the legitimacy of their own positions, therefore, it is not a matter of mutual annihilation, but of the recognition that they each perceive the other not as an adversary but as a legitimate and reasonable peer.

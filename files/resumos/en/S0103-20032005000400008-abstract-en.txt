The object of study in this research is the ecotourism experience developed in the Poço Encantado Waterfall located in Teresina de Goiás, in the Chapada dos Veadeiros region, Northeast of Goiás. It is a family business established since 1996 opened to public visitation which offers rural and ecological tourism. The activities developed there are also related to the territory of the biggest remaining community of quilombos in Brazil: the Kalunga community. In order to understand this object of study we attempted to attain the following objectives: a) To know the strategies that form and were implemented in the chain of ecotourism in the waterfall of Poço Encantado; b) To understand in what ways the Kalunga people are inserted within such chain; c) To reflect about the formulation and implementation of public policies which can benefit the Quilombolas communities in Brazil; d) To provide a plan concerning future perspectives. In this research, we chose the single case study as a methodological resource. We consider the Poço Encantado Waterfall to be a unique manifestation that must be contextualized and part of the present capitalist society which presents itself in a contradictory and dynamic way. The purpose of this research is to contribute in the agribusiness field. This business proposition is to analyze and point out immediate and viable ways to change the approach and strategies in the activities involved along the productive chains.

This paper investigates the ratio between real exchange rate and chicken meat prices in Brazil, from 2008 to 2012. The Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) was applied. The results show a long-run ratio between the real exchange rate and the frozen broiler price - cointegration. However, evidences of the chicken meat price sensibility to the exchange rate are weak for the analyzed period. On the other hand, the paper suggests the evidence of the commodity currency. The paper highlights the importance of analyzing effects of the frozen chick meat on exchange rate in Brazil in the recent period.

This paper presents a summary of the diverse occupations of public spaces in SÃ£o Paulo, especially those in which activists (or similar) have been fighting for the expansion of rights to the city and its public facilities. These occupations are carried out by networks of collectives comprising students, artists, architects, associations and many other agents. A focus has been adopted on the understanding of a certain genealogy of these phenomena &#8211; of which the days of June 2013 represent an indispensable reference &#8211; as well as on the identification of the main ethnographic challenges to the anthropological approach.

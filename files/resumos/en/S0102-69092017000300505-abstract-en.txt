This paper explores recent developments on the Letelier case. Orlando Letelier, former minister of Salvador Allende&#8217;s Government and opponent of the Chilean military regime, was shot in Washington, on September 21st, 1976. His assassination came to be regarded as the most spurious action of the Chilean secret police and also from the so-called Condor operation. After four decades of pursuit by justice, the Letelier case is still object of interdisciplinary academic research in different countries. This paper is based on diplomatic documentation and literature, as well as on the contributions of transnational justice.

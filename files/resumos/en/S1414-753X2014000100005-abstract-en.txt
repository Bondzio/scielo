In the text are discussed plans and action designed to safeguard the diversity of flora and fauna existing in the lands that were flooded to form the lake of Itaipu Hydroelectric, betwen Brazil and Paraguay. For this, we analyze the guidelines developed by the company responsible for the work, which guided the production of inventories of fauna and flora, in a developmental context. The loss of biodiversity, the transformation of the river dynamics, the destruction and fragmentation of habitats and the disappearance of the scenic landscape of the Sete Quedas are hallmarks of that moment.

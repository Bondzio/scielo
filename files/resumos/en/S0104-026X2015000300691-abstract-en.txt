The debates on intersectionality occupy a central place in the theorization about gender and migration. This paper explores the potential of intersectionality to think about social processes and experiences, principally, international migration and migrant experiences. Moreover, it analyses some of the 'problems' this perspective presents. In order to accomplish this purpose, it reconstructs the origins and consolidation of intersectionality, its implications in social sciences in general and migration studies in particular, and its methodological and theoretical ambiguities. Finally, this paper recuperates the contributions of intersectionality to empirically study the relationship between work and migration from outlining labor trajectories in paid domestic work of Peruvian women in Argentina. In methodological terms, this research is based on a qualitative work (participant observation and unstructured interviews) developed since 2011 up to the present in Cordoba city (Argentina) with Peruvian women who have been involved in this labor activity in their migration itineraries.

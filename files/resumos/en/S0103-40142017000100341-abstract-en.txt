Abstract From an immanent analysis, this papers dialogues with Luk√°cs aesthetics, presenting some of the main categories used by the philosopher to build a new proposal about the aesthetic field. The central thesis is that that art shares a special condition of the subject-object relation, in which the production of a certain homogeneous field by the artist refines the opacities of everyday life, enabling the rise of the social being to a higher level of objectification, uplifting humanity to the condition of recording its self-awareness. Art, with this elevation, confirms human immanence. To carry out this investigation, we strove to identify, based on mediation derived from the centrality of work, the kinds of reflections that exist in everyday life and how some of these reflexes develop and differ from the others to achieve a certain degree of superior objectivity.

An extension of the General Vulnerability Index - IVG to cover a geographic region was used to assess the vulnerability of the municipalities within the region of Itajub√°, MG, Brazil. The IVG methodology, developed by Fiocruz, is based on socioeconomic, epidemiological and climate indicators. The result pointed to socioeconomic factors as the major contributor to vulnerability in the region. As showed by the analysis of extreme precipitation events, climate showed to be an important vulnerability factor in 30% of the cases. The low quality of epidemiological data on regional scale, especially the incidence rates, was the main limiting factor for the regionalization of the IVG.

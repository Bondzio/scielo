Abstract This study aims to describe the relations between Catholicism (and other religious groups) and politics in the bioethical field of the contemporary Argentina. The question about these relations is relevant in light of the discussions that have taken place in recent years in Argentina regarding the problem of people's rights over their bodies. In order to accomplish this goal, six fields of controversy related to the bioethical politics were selected and studied from the perspective of legislation, process of debate and speeches that took part on these debates. To do this, an approach that combines process tracing with quantitative discourse analysis techniques was used.

This article presents the macro-trends that defines the current differentiation of environmental education field in Brazil, and seeks to interpret them through a dialogue with its recent debate and with the support of references from Political Ecology and Social Field produced by Bourdieu. The reflection identifies three macro-trends competing for symbolic and objective hegemony of Environmental Education field in Brazil: conservationist, pragmatic and critical, which function as Weberian ideal types with didactic, analytical and political purposes, although they don't expect to draw an objectivist representation of the reality.

Municipal Social Policies must prioritize citizens' participation in decision-making processes. This is expected to take place by means of mechanisms which allow for a substantial engagement of both citizens and social organizations. The article analyzes and assesses the opportunities, contributions as well as the limitations concerning citizenship participation that can be seen in institutionalized structures on the local/municipal level. The idea is to investigate some of the proposals and alternatives that, from the point of view of participants, would be necessary for the enhancement of local governance and for the increased institutional efficacy of social intervention. In order to illustrate my argument, I draw mainly upon the experience of citizenship participation in the Murcia Region (Spain) - which implemented the new autonomous laws of social services -, comparing it with few other clarifying experiences.

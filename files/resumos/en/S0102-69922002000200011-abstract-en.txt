This paper deals with the problem of the scientific practice of researchers in social science who use forms of knowledge historically produced in other contexts. How to operate with alien forms of knowledge? The paper tries to answer this question through the discussion of sociologists from the Arab world and through the way that Pr. Arkoun, Pr. Dja√Øt, Pr. El Jabri deal with the issue in the analysis of Moslem Arabic realities. The different approaches of the object of this paper shows how the contextual mediation is relevant to social science. The tools of analysis are not automatically transferred but they subjected to the necessity of decontextualization and recontextualization. Thus, intercontextuality as a researcher practice is a process of dealing with the concepts of social science. Intercontextuality operates within the scientific practice and has both an epistemological and an hermeneutical dimension.

ABSTRACT In this article we employ bibliometric techniques to examine the authorial, disciplinary, bibliographical, and thematic profiles of the Journal DADOS, from its foundation to the present (1966-2015). The database was amassed using two different methods, the periodical&#8217;s most recent output was scraped from the website SciELO in XML format while the older issues had to be scanned and its bibliography extracted by painstakingly copying and pasting each entry. We employed two techniques to analyze the material: Correspondence Analysis, to determine the patterns of co-citations and thus to chart the bibliographical map of the periodical, and Topic Modeling, to identify the main themes and approaches in the corpus. The results show that Dados privileged themes and debates that were most relevant in each period, in a constant attempt to bring together methodological rigor and public relevance.

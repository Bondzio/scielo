Recent concern over the issue of political exclusion challenges traditional understanding of mechanisms of representation, specifically with regard to the conviction that the key to good political representation lies in the ideas and program shared by those who represent others and those who are represented -- with no reference as to the identity of those who represent. On the other hand, there is a growing claim for the physical presence of excluded groups in the locales where decisions are made which has frequently led to the adoption of electoral quotas. Nonetheless, more than just a matter of choosing one form of representation over another, we should understand the limitations of each, seeking a more just system that incorporates both presence and ideas.

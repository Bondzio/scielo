This article deals with a study done together with teachers of the deaf, to value the teachers' perceptions of themes related to their pedagogical tasks, with the aim to improving them. It investigated the type and level of reflection of these teachers of the deaf. To this end, 13 teachers from two large schools for deaf students, working with the concept of Total Communication, were interviewed. The data obtained were analyzed using four thematic areas which emerged from teachers' reports. A concern with pedagogical issues was evident in the reports, inserted into a vision of "normality" and "social adaptation". The clinical concepts of deafness and of a deaf person persist, however.

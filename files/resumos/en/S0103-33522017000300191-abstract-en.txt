Abstract The paper deals with the repertoire of action of the Brazilian Indigenous movement between 2009 and 2016 focusing on the cycle of protests the approval of the Constitutional Amendment Proposal 215/2000. This bill proposes the transference of demarcatory competence to the Brazilian Congress. We collected and categorized all the posts made on the websites of the Articulação dos Povos Indígenas do Brasil (APIB) about their political activity in the period. We conclude that this movement mainly uses a non-contentious repertoire, with emphasis on its active use of digital media and dissemination in the press throughout the analyzed period, which has been declining in quantitative terms. Protest actions are multiethnic in nature, meaning they involve more than one ethnic group. Finally, we verified that the actions of the movement are concentrated mainly in Brasília, followed by Mato Grosso do Sul and Amazonas.

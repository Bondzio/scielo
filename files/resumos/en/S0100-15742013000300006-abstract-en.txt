This article discusses the research results on the conditions of educational quality based on the analysis of the application of the Quality Conditions Index pertaining to the first years of elementary local public schools, in 2007 and 2011. Considering aspects of the educational policy, namely, faculty work conditions, material and structural resources of the schools, and school management conditions, said index measures the possible effort made by the policy in order to respond to the educational demands faced due to the circumstances found in Brazil. The study concludes by showing that apparently the general state of the educational quality in Brazil has improved and the municipalities that have obtained the best results are those in which there are either less than 1000 or more than 10,000 students enrolled in local public schools.

This paper aims the analysis of the experience of suffering from the viewpoint of the executioner of violence, taking as its privileged perspective how this issue overlaps with religious experiences, particularly Pentecostal. To do this, I suggest the analysis of the testimonies of the so-called "rescued from death": a group of men somehow related in their past with crime experiences, nowadays members of the Assembleia de Deus dos Últimos Dias - Adud, headquartered in São João de Meriti, periphery of Rio de Janeiro. The path to redemption offered by this church to these subjects is presented as a complex composition of significant elements in this process: the acceptance of the suffering and the pain of the bandit; the forgiveness of their sins; and the reconfiguration of their subjectivity - based upon fame and power when related to criminal practices - into a gospel version of it, represented by the potent image of the "rescued". These combined practices and representations, I suggest, form a particularly effective Pentecostal device for dealing with suffering through the circumvention of victimization.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Welfare    State in the Age of Reason</i> is nor a neutral or modest book. It openly defends    a position and suggests specific paths for social policies in Brazil based on    successful international experiences that have produced more equality. In its    first sentence, the author claims that the book is a defense of the welfare    state - in clear opposition to a widespread idea highlighting its crisis - which    shows resilience and solid institutionalization. Furthermore, an expansion is    observed in emerging countries precisely during these decades of austerity -    a period known as the "silver years" of the welfare state. After declaring her    position, the arguments in the book are built from the objections and difficulties    presented by an imaginary skeptical discussant, but that, in fact, express common    arguments, pessimistic or ideological, which ultimately justify the inertia    or a negative view concerning the option of a bold and truly transformative    solution, on the one hand, or deny the credibility or even the desirability    of a more radical redistribution, on the other hand. From these stated assumptions,    the author dares to sustain and suggest that these solutions are feasible and    presents her arguments in the defense of a universal welfare-redistributive    state. This is achieved by mobilizing an extensive and updated bibliography    on states or welfare regimes, comparing historical experiences and presenting    a set of data and evidence capable of convincing the reader of the viability    of her gamble. At a minimum, it raises a promising question for readers who    desire more egalitarian outcomes in our "welfare state": is this indeed a feasible    path for Brazil? This is one of the merits of the book: it provides not only    information and relevant analysis concerning development and the welfare regimes'    state of affairs, but it also urges us to think about policy alternatives.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The specification    of the assumptions from which the author builds her arguments is the point of    departure and presented in the first part of the book. These include both defining    the welfare state as social welfare - the object of intervention of any welfare    state - and its relation with development. Without questioning, the author assumes    a broad delimitation of the welfare state - which is not free of controversy    - by identifying the minimum requirements of public intervention and categorizing    them along a line of maximum and minimum manifestations (different from other    schemes, such as the well-known typology of Esping-Andersen). In this sense,    it seems that the author does not endorse the classical distinction between    states and regimes of welfare, using the terms interchangeably. Instead of attempting    to solve these conceptual problems, she adopts a practical solution to the problem    of concept definition: what the welfare state actually is in its various empirical    manifestations. To develop the concept of welfare, the second "assumption",    the author bases her arguments on classic works such as Titmuss, Marshall and    Sen and then builds a normative definition along the lines of the Scandinavian    school of social welfare. In this integrating reconstruction format, the reader    is presented with the notion that the welfare state should seek the satisfaction    of social needs, to offset social costs for economic activities, to guarantee    social rights and to promote the expansion of capacities, formalized as real    freedom. Still in the first part of the book, a recurring theme in the political    agenda is dealt with, namely the notion of a trade-off between development and    distribution in which Kerstenetzky presents a quite relevant and innovative    contribution. By questioning the assumptions that welfare states presupposes    a certain level of economic development or even a trade-off between growth and    redistribution, which would involve choosing either one or the other, the author    presents arguments and irrefutable evidence which demonstrate a positive relationship    between welfare state and development, particularly the contribution of the    former to the latter.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An important analytical    distinction guides this discussion and places it in a diverse field from social    development theory. It refers to the distinction between social policies oriented    economically and economic policies socially oriented. Such a distinction goes    beyond an analysis of the unintentional social effects of economic policies    and vice versa, and considers the degree of autonomy of each policy field. Having    as a paradigmatic example the Scandinavian case, Kerstenetzky shows how some    elements of social policies were crucial to boost development: universal policies    to support families and social services such as education and infant or elderly    care services had economic impacts on both the supply (expanding social services,    creating jobs and promoting labor market inclusion) and demand in general. Regarding    socially-oriented economic policies, the author highlights the reconciliation    between economic growth and distributive objectives. The argument stating a    positive relationship between the welfare state and development will be the    guiding thread of the book and the backbone that justifies the construction    of a model of development rooted in welfare policies; not restricted, therefore,    to a strict economic point of view.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second part    of the book recovers the historical, ideational roots, characteristics, distinctions    and specificities, and the recent developments of welfare state changes associated    with new social risks. This effort covers a comprehensive reconstruction filled    with data and information, from its origins in Europe up to the first decade    of this century, and includes a description and an analysis of the "belated"    welfare states, in this case referring to Latin American countries. Against    the argument of a welfare state crisis, dismissed after an analysis of social    spending, the book presents a framework for the changes in recent times in the    sense of being changes in the architecture of policy programs and adaptations    that resulted in the privatization of welfare provision in "traditional areas"    - and although not becoming residual, there might be possible impacts on redistributive    capacity -, and the expansion of public intervention in the area of services.    In the same way different welfare regimes were formed, different responses are    given to new external circumstances in the "Silver Age", which followed the    "Golden Age", and also receives the name the Age of Reason of the welfare state    - an expression which, incidentally, gives the book its title. The explanatory    key for this diversity is to be found in the different political priorities    and specific institutional trajectories in such a way that the political voluntarism    is associated with the consequences of previous choices, which includes the    legitimacy achieved by states, regimes or models of welfare - as the terms are    used in a interchangeably way. However, in terms of the future of the welfare    state, the analysis raises many questions which are not given definitive answers    because despite being resilient and institutionalized it might also be "changing    its soul" to use the expression of the author. Although the author denies these    changes, the data suggests less redistributive trends. Could Kerstenetzky's    bets concerning the construction of welfare states that are able to simultaneously    produce development and significant redistribution be compromised given the    cracks in the mirror?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third part    of the book focuses on Brazil and it ranges from the historical reconstruction    of the Brazilian welfare State (given the adopted definition, the term is applicable    to Brazil) to a prospective analysis about future directions - or the consequences    in terms of a future agenda - which, as the argument develops, could benefit    from this belated condition and mirror the best known international experiences,    in other words, those that have produced more equality. Moving beyond the simple    reproduction of well known interpretations, Kerstenetzky brings something new    concerning the most recent developments by analyzing closely the first decade    of this century in which she identifies as the prelude of an extended universalism    that would characterize the third wave of institutional innovation and the diffusion    of social rights in Brazil, preceded by two others: the corporativist and the    basic universalism. In this third wave, which reflects the constitutional changes    and the variations in political coalitions, a shift is observed in the governmental    strategy in the sense that growth becomes "a variable, to a certain extent,    endogenous to policies and social spending (...) and to administer the fiscal    adjustment in order to gain increasing degrees of freedom for the promotion    of growth with redistribution". In other words, this period would have witnessed    the experimentation of economically-oriented social policies and socially-oriented    economic policies. The demonstration of this argument is supported by a massive    set of primary and secondary data, one of the merits and original contribution    of the book.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, from the    normative perspective that guides the book - namely, the need to advance towards    the reduction of inequalities by means of public interventions of a certain    type and by forging the articulation between economic and social policies -    the fundamental aspect is to acknowledge the centrality of the socioeconomic    inequalities in the country, although there has been a movement towards extended    universalism, it has not been truly redistributive yet. This is a core argument,    articulating all others, which defends a new model of development that is redistributive    and protect individuals from the new social risks of today. This also means    to challenge all skepticism concerning the economic-financial and political    sustainability of such a welfare state. It is precisely in the largest welfare    states (those characterized by maximum manifestation) where the financial and    political conditions for a greater redistribution exist. This may be another    one of the book's major contributions to the debate: the inescapably articulated    character of economic and social policies as well as the political legitimacy    that support them. In addition to concerns of justice, redistribution is also    economically sustainable.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The end result    is a mature and audacious book that shows an author engaged in the theme of    inequality and development with the aim of producing knowledge that could inform    public policy alternatives in Brazil by comparing international experiences.    It also reveals the author's double affiliation as an economist and a political    scientist. If a certain economic bias emerges - in a positive way, it is important    to add, for a fruitful analysis of social expenditures, their redistributive    results and consequences to inequality, for example - given the nature of the    data used, the policy analysis is not ignored. It emerges, for example, from    the analysis of the political factors that could explain both the emergence    and expansion, as well as the format and the degree of sustainability of social    interventions, citing, among others, the idea of path dependency to explain    the continuity of trends as a function of interests and ideas formed throughout    the development of welfare regimes - along the trail of the new historical institutionalism    applied to the analysis of public policy decisions. In other words, fine political    economy. Part of the book produces a summary of the most renowned analysis concerning    welfare states or regimes, but it also forges a reinterpretation from the main    focus - namely, which model of development produces greater distributive justice    - and the assumptions and theoretical and conceptual framework which are points    of departure. For the novice on the subject, the revision and reconstruction    parts offer a broad state of the art picture, especially concerning the debates    and controversies in the analysis of the welfare state, including a mix of historical    account and theoretical-normative arguments. Alternatively, for the more experienced    reader, it provides an innovative analysis based on a quite ample informational    material, as well as presenting a set of updated and original information from    different sources, which is the result of mapping and matching together diverse    findings to support the arguments. More than a reinterpretation, a re-explanation    is produced, particularly concerning the recent developments of welfare states    or regimes.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the book    has also the merit of merging quality and theoretically informed research with    the <i>advocacy</i> of a specific model of development. A book certainly bound    to stir controversy, but an essential read for those interested in the subject    of social policies and development in Brazil.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

abstract After the French Revolution of 1789, the democratic State established the universal rights of the citizen. Social movements initially embraced this universalist ideal and fought for the recognition of their rights: women gained the right to vote and blacks obtained anti-racist laws. Later, the recognition of equality gave way to the struggle for the recognition of differences. This text seeks to focus on "affirmative actions" implemented by the State and its problematic outcomes.

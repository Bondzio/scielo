In August 28, 2003, after two years working and having collected 17000 testimonials, the Peruvian Committee for the Truth and Reconciliation presented its Final Information on the violence period from 1980 to 2000. This Committee shared many traits with its equivalents from Guatemala and South Africa. All three Committees were considered gender-sensitive for they tried to bring to light the experiences of violence suffered by women. Such an emphasis reflected the will to write "more inclusive truths" as well as changes in international jurisprudence. In this article, I examine the gender-sensitive research strategies and the ways in which truth committees incorporated these strategies to their work. Truth and memory are, in fact, crossed by gender, but not necessarily in the way that common sense understands it. Thus, I hope to offer a more subtle understanding of the dimensions associated to gender in war.

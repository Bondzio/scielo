Rural violence has reached dramatic levels in several Latin American countries in last decades. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze the origins of that violence in order to find solutions to the problems that cause it. The purpose of the present essay is to explore relations between the agrarian structure, agrarian reform and rural violence in Latin America. Its interrelations are examined from a historical perspective in which global transformation processes are underscored. Factors such as the political regime, markets, technology, crops (for instance, coca) and State actions have an important presence in the several kinds of conflicts and violence in rural areas. Nevertheless, the level of influence of such factors varies a good deal according to the characteristics of existing agrarian structure and social relations. A special examination is made on the influence of agrarian reforms and/or peasants' demands for agrarian reform over rural conflicts and violence. The cases of Chile, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico and some countries from Central America are considered. Although preliminary, the conclusions present some comparative analyses. However, it is my understanding that those should be further developed, but I hope they might offer reference points for more encompassing comparative analyses. The studies on rural conflicts and violence have so far focused mainly on one country. Comparative studies, in my opinion, can offer a broader analytical scope and comparative context might open new possibilities for a better understanding of causes and consequences of rural violence in Latin American countries.

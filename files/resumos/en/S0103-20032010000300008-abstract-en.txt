This paper aimed to analyze the comparative performance from the Minas Gerais "Cerrado" coffee producers and the south-western conventional coffee producers, according to the returns and the risk level. Differentiation and costs were emphasized because they were the strategic options adopted by the grower in these two regions The margins and potential loss of these two producer groups were measured, in a way that a relation between risks and returns could be presented. The returns were estimated by an index that relates costs and prices - operational margin -, and risk analysis was conducted based on Value at Risk estimates. The results indicated that, besides obtaining better returns, the Minas Gerais "Cerrado" producers had smaller loss potential than those from the south-west. The favorable results obtained by the Minas Gerais "Cerrado" coffee producers were related to the differences in productive costs and coffee quality. Improved product quality and productive management were the most relevant aspects found to enhance the performance of the south-western coffee producer. As for the "Cerrado" coffee production, the importance of maintaining the efforts related to differentiation and to the productivity was pointed out.

ABSTRACT Thirty years ago, 1988 Brazilian Constitution dedicated a specific chapter to the rights of indigenous peoples. Studies about violations of indigenous rights led them to in that chapter the foundation and explanation of these rights. The way of life of the different indigenous peoples in Brazil was recognized, as well as their autonomous legal capacity. During the work of the Constituent Assembly, orchestrated accusations of conspiracy against national interests sought, without total success, to destroy the obtained accomplishments. These attacks never relinquished and there are nowadays numerous threats to the constitutional rights of indigenous peoples.

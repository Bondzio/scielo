ABSTRACT The Triple Helix has developed into an internationally recognized model that is at the heart of the emerging discipline of innovation studies, and a guide to policy and practice at the local, regional, national and multinational levels. University-industry-government interactions, forming a &#8220;triple helix&#8221; for innovation and entrepreneurship, are the key to knowledge-based economic growth and social development. The article discusses the model&#8217;s origin, concept, dynamics, sources, and alternate routes.

ABSTRACT Senior high school performance, stagnated for more than ten years, is related to a general insufficiency of basic education. A recent law that changes the national education law needs to be reviewed together with the common core curriculum in order to become a synthetic educational reference. Better distribution of tax revenues is suggested, as well as logistical support to the counties, so that they can really be held accountable for primary schooling. A teachers&#8217; career program is proposed so that they may progress without ceasing to teach, and become tutors in the practical training of futures colleagues.

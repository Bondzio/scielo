This article focuses on the new editorial model launched in Revista Estudos Feministas in 2002, that is, three years after its installation in Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC). While firstly detailing the memories of such metamorphosis, the text refers to the transitions of REF's editorship format, to the purposes and criteria of the new structure, as well as the meanings of the team expansion in relation to some national and international feminist publications. Eventually the article briefly discusses the advantages and challenges implicated in this new editorial policy.

The presente article intends to be a contribution to the study of consciousness in a sociohistorical perspective, therefore we elected Vygotsky as our main author for the development of our refletions. To make this article possible, besides the contribution of the above mentioned author , we have used works of other authors who were also studies of Vygotsky books, and also two other authors, Agnes Heller and Fernando G. Rey. Through the articulation of the theoric contributions, we have developed some refletions about the consciousness category, stressing its constitution process, its mediations and importance to the understanding of human being ways of think, feel and act.

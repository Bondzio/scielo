Abstract: The central issue of this paper is to understand the implications of the dilemma experienced by young policemen in the context of UPPs. We intend to assess the exercise of police mandate at the so called territories under intervention or pacified communities. We take into account police discourses about their practical approach and, therefore, discuss the proactive regulatory social function assigned to policing and their challenges. We have observed that one of the key dilemmas resides exactly on the issue of not becoming &#8220;too much authority&#8221; nor &#8220;too less authority&#8221;.

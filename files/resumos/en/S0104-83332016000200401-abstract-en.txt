Abstract In this text I comment on recent discussions about sexual economies, human trafficking and the relationship between these problematics, considering new questions that are raised in the debate about them. I dialog with other articles published in this issue of the Cadernos Pagu, considering the results of studies conducted in Brazil and other Latin American countries. My comments focus on two issues that arose in the dialog between this work and the articles of Christian Groess Gren, Marcia Anita Sprandel, Kamala Kempadoo and Amalia Cabezas published in this volume. I first refer to the analytical possibilities and the limits of concepts such as sexual economies and sex markets. A second question relates to forms of governmentality articulated in the regimes for fighting human trafficking that affect these exchanges, particularly sexual work. The question is, in the fifteen years since the enactment of the Palermo Protocol, the most important supranational legal instrument related to this crime, what new issues appear in the analysis of these regimes and of their effects on sexual and economic exchanges?

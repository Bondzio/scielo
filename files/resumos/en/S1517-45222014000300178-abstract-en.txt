This paper examines class structure and social mobility in Brazil using the most                current data available. It is presented the evolution of class structure from the                1970s to 2000, which indicates that if measured in terms of the occupations, there                was a gradual decrease in the classes of professionals and skilled manual workers.                This change, however, does not mean that Brazilian society has become predominantly                comprised by a middle class, as some social scientists have argued. We claim here                that information about intergenerational mobility is essential to define the main                cleavages of class. Thus, the article describes the pattern of social fluidity in                Brazil, which determines both the inequality in opportunities for social mobility and                the main points of social closure in Brazilian social structure. The social fluidity                in the country is best described by the vertical - or hierarchical - pattern, which                implies that the distance between social classes in terms of intergenerational                mobility is fundamental. The role played by achieved education in mediating between                the origin and destination classes is also presented. The analyzes are mostly based                on data from the survey Social Dimensions of Inequality (PDSD-2008), although data                from the national survey by household sampling (PNAD) for the years1973, 1982, 1988,                and 1996 are also presented.

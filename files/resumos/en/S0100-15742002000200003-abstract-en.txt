This paper analyses ethical questions faced in research developed with children of various ages, groups and contexts. It discusses the childhood conception that underlines research presented in monographs, dissertations and thesis that are presented or commented along the text. The article refers to three issues. The first issue focuses on names (true or fictional) of children observed or interviewed. The second issue discusses the use made of children's images (in photographs, videos and films). The third issue deals with the implications or the social impact of scientific texts and it asks if it is possible to contribute with data or results, preventing children and young people from suffering the consequences of the institutional situations which are revealed by the research.

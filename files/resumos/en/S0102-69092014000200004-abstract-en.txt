Paulo Freire states the existence of two sources for the sense of fatalism present in our society: the misguided view of God and the Brazilian social and historical context. Based on such conception, he develops his social critique as a condemnation of the unfair world that thwarts the full realization of the human person and as an announcement and encouragement of a new social order, developed and democratic. In order to achieve such goal, it is necessary to promote in the subject his historical sense and capacity of acting in the world. This article discusses the catholic foundation of Freire's pedagogy of 'conscientização' and of his narrative strategy of the testimony as producers of social change and examples of the new catholic relationship with the mundane.

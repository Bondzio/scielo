This article offers an analysis of Almanac of the Dead, by Angelita La Escap√≠a, in light of feminist theories and of a post-modern perspective on time, emphasizing the notion of present pasts through the exploration of the metaphor of a live photograph of Marx, shown in the novel. The passion the character Angelita demonstrates for the photograph of Marx is seen as form of synthesis between the Native American perception of time as eternal presents -- which is also resistance against oppression insofar as the past is never forgotten --, and the Marxist concepts of time and history.

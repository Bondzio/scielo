Abstract After the Pilot Project of Empowering People with Disabilities for Work in Rio Grande do Sul was implemented, a network of actors started to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities into the workplace through the Affirmative Law 8213/91. In this context, the experiences of people with autism brought to light theoretical and practical discussions on both the condition of this diagnosis as being characterized as a disability, and the ways of managing these people in the everyday life of labour. Thomas is one of the young men whose participation in the Project I followed. Through the ethnography of his &#8216;case&#8217; itÂ´s possible to reflect on the effects of inclusion policies in management practices and subjectification processes of people with disabilities, as well as shed light on the agency opportunities for those people across the symbolic and practical construction of citizenship and &#8216;social sensibilities&#8217; in Brazil.

Abstract This article profiles Ciclo da cana-de-açúcar(The Sugar-Cane Cycle) of José Lins do Rego and O tempo e o vento (Time and the wind) of Erico Verissimo, as well as articles and interviews of their authors to investigate the production and circulation of region and regionalism ideas. Thus, it investigates the ideas production context with which the writers dialogue establishing a repertoire of themes and issues, which although being common to both, find different resolutions in each case. Therefore, it aims to evidence that the tension between local, regional and national organizes the narratives and produces the nexus between literary form and social process, in a movement that makes the region the problem faced and not only the narrated theme, and the regionalism a forming element of the narrative.

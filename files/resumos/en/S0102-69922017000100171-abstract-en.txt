Abstract This study aims to understand how financial transactions affect social relationships between farmers and directors of credit unions operating resources provided by government programs. The problem of research sought to understand the strategies of these leaders, called mediators, to articulate the symbolic universe of farmers, with the expectations of public policy and the circuit where the money flows. To understand this issue an empirical research was carried out in a Cooperative Credit System called Cresol. The theoretical framework that guided the analysis of the information articulated the concepts of frames (McAdam, McCarthy and Zald, 1999) and "negotiation of intimacy" (Zelizer, 2005). The conclusion is that the mediators operate its strategy of making trust and friendship (intimacy) on institutional affiliation. Its action acquires an instrumental bias in that converts economic transactions in intimacy, financial transfers in expanding and strengthening social relations and identity system.

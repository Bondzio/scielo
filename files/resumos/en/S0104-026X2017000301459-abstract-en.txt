Abstract: Based on theoretical references about the conception of the &#8220;imaginal&#8221;, that is, modes of constitution of bodies and sexualities through images, this analysis will concentrate on the film "Feos, sucios y malos" (Brutti, sporchi and cattivi) (1976) directed by Ettore Scola, aiming at observing the visualities of the body and its transformations when presented as excess of the representations. In the film, bodies, sexuality and desires mark the excesses of the representation of the popular and, therefore, a rupture of the visual normality of bodies. Thus, the representation of women and other sexual identities are woven between the axes of a normalizing gaze that the film raises to the grotesque as a means of criticism. The analysis of &#8220;Feos, sucios y malos&#8221; questions, in the criticism, the dominant and normalizing forms of inscribing the sexualities in visual devices of contemporary signification.

Abstract: This study aims to analyze the regional productive efficiency of agriculture using estimation techniques of stochastic production frontiers and exploratory spatial data analysis. The estimation was carried out for permanent and temporary crops separately using data from 2006 Agricultural Census. The results of production equation show that productive factors such as land area and labor promote productivity gains to those crops related to respectively increase returns to scale and technological intensity. Results also show that the linkage between efficiency and specialization is positive for permanent crops but negative for temporary crops. Additionally, the efficiency of temporary crops seems more sensitive to geographical factors as precipitations, temperature and biomes. The spatial analysis applied to permanent crops identified high efficiency clusters in Northeast and South and low efficiency clusters in the North. Considering temporary crops, it was identified high efficiency clusters in Northeast and Southeast and low efficiency clusters concentrated in North and Northeast of Brazil.

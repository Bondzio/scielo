The Tilápias production has detached like a activity wich confer chances for famlilys producers of semi-árida region, with a production of fishes in dams, wells and lakes, basic for surviver of communities and producers, of semi-árida region. The general objective this paper was evaluate the performance of familys organization producers of tilápias, representantive of the productive reality in the semi-árida region of Rio Grande do Norte. The methodology was the case study with intentional sampling of families organizations, representative of reality tilápias of familys production in the region potiguars semi-árido. For analise of performance it used the tool of "Escala de Likert", identifying competitives pointers to differents segments of suply chain, and influencing the global preformance of suply chain. It used the matrix of importance and performance os Slack, in complement, to command the degrees of importance and these influence in the general performance. Finally, this research show the possibility to use the analysis tools, normally use for biggers agroindustrials sistems, for family production, detaching its conditions and dificulties. Also, it indicates itens excellent for specifies research for tilápias suply chain, in the scope of familys production.

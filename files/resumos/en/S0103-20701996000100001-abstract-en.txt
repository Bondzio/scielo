The globalization of capitalism and the new transnational division of labour which is dinamized by new technologies, by informatization and the robotization of production &#8211; a process which also expresses itself through the migrations between nations in a broad process of worldwide urbanization &#8211; show us the birth and re-birth of racial problems associated to nationalisms and localisms. All these facts emphasize that globalization is accompanied by a fragmentation in which the frontiers between class and race are mixed but mostly not dissolved. In this context racial problems can be seen as an expression of movements and configurations, and as a fundamental dimension of a rising global society.

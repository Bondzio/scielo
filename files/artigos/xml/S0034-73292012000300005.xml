<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the last decade, concerns with the increase of   emissions in the aviation sector augmented considerably among scientist and   policymakers. In the 1990s, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change   (IPCC) stated that the total contribution of aircraft emissions of carbon   dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) was around 2%. Today, despite the improvement in fuel   efficiency and new technologies, this industry is expected to grow   considerably.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a> It is estimated that the aviation   sector is now contributing to almost 5% of global emissions and are expected to   double or triple by 2050 if no action is taken, jeopardizing the 2 &deg;C target.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More importantly, this industry has been one of the   most rapidly growing sources of CO<sub>2</sub>. In the European Union (EU), for   example, emissions from aviation fuels expanded 80% from 1990 and 2009.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a> In an attempt to cope with this problem, the EU has recently decided to extend   its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to include aviation. However, many countries   and airline associations powerfully contested the new Directive. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To contextualize, since January 2012, the EU compels   all airlines to be accountable for its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when   landing in or taking off from EU airports independently of nationality,   flights' origin and destination.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>4</sup></a> To illustrate the general   dissatisfaction, China's top negotiator Xie Zhenhua said that "this decision by   the EU will seriously jeopardize &#91;our efforts to&#93; tackle the international   efforts to climate change."<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a> Interestingly, China was not alone. In   fact, after the approval of the new legislation, the EU found itself isolated.   A coalition of countries, notably the Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa   group (BRICS) and the United States joined forces to take measures against   Europe.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The US, in particular, showed vehement rejection. One   example can be found in a letter, signed by Hillary Clinton and Ray Lahood   (Transportation Secretary), objecting the fact that international airlines are   required to transmit to the EU information on their emissions.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a> The   letter urged the EU to re-engage with the world and stated that "absent such   willingness on the part of the EU, we will be compelled to take appropriate   action."<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>8</sup></a> Nevertheless, on the other side of the   Atlantic, Connie Hedegaard, EU Climate Commissioner, declared following the   approval of the new law: "After a crystal-clear ruling today, the EU now   expects US airlines to respect EU law as the EU respects US law."<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From this episode, it became clear that while some   highlight the positive aspects of the EU's measure, others pungently condemn it   for being illegal, unfair and unilateral. Given this binary perception, this   paper interrogates why the EU's directive was so severely criticized, despite   its apparent degree of environmental coherence. It argues that concerns with   competitiveness and risks of legal inconsistency at the WTO are important   elements to this conundrum. However, they are insufficient to explain the   reasons for an isolated Europe. Beyond the aforementioned aspects, I suggest   that the method chosen by the EU to deal with the aviation emissions was   perceived inappropriate, mainly because it was viewed as an imposed solution to   the rest of the world. Therefore, I claim that this conflict has more to do   with a normative divide than with a substantive divergence on what should be   done in regards to aviation emissions. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My analysis is based on present literature about   competitiveness and the links between trade and climate, but gives particular   weight to an empirical assessment based on extensive dialogues with numerous   stakeholders and the participation at roundtables relevant to the topic.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a> The paper is divided in three parts. First, it presents the scope of the   Directive in a historical perspective. Second, it explores the EU's measure   through three different angles: legal, economical and political. The third and   final part explores some possible solutions to overcome this conflict.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The EU's strategy to   cope with climate change: stuck between insufficient global progress and fears   of carbon leakage</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the heart of   the debate on how to manage emissions from the aviation sector lies a broader   and growing concern related to the interface between trade and climate change.   While the EU's decision is unique for including non-European airlines into the   EU scheme, it is only one example among several possibilities dealing with   carbon leakage.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a> This problem   refers to countries that are taking strong measures to internalize the costs of   carbon emissions, but could be exposed to unfair conditions of competitiveness   comparing to countries "carbon heavens." That is, because of loose regulatory   frameworks, some industries could move to other countries in quest of reduced   environmental burden. In order to cope with this risk, mainly the EU and the US   are considering the use of two mechanisms &#150; free allocation of emissions   allowances and border measures.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup>12</sup></a> The expression   "border adjustment" has several denominations<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><sup>13</sup></a>,   but its key objective is to balance the costs between those who undertake   abatement measures and non-abating countries. Therefore, in the case of   aviation, the inclusion of all airlines (independently of their nationality) is   a direct response to the fears of carbon leakage and unfair competition. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moreover, the   present state of multilateral negotiations is another relevant dimension for   the argument of this paper. Because of high levels of uncertainty, the problem   of a global regulatory gap can only be reinforced. Despite the ongoing   officials talks, mostly under the Durban Platform<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><sup>14</sup></a>,   concerns with the unequal costs of emission reductions remain a key obstacle to   advancing negotiations within the United Nations Framework Convention on   Climate Change (UNFCCC). In particular, proposals from the US and the EU   relating to carbon taxes before Copenhagen increased tensions between developed   and developing countries. Considering potential conflicts between trade and   climate regimes, emerging countries &#150; mainly the Brazil, South Africa, India   and China coalition (BASIC) &#150; have been highly skeptical of integrating trade   dimensions into the post-Kyoto agreement, with China taking the lead in   contesting any attempt to link these issues.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><sup>15</sup></a> In this sense, the analysis of the inclusion of aviation into the ETS has to be   understood under a broader perspective, which considers the turmoil in climate   governance and the perception that the principle of common but differentiated   responsibilities must be respected.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>16</sup></a></font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides the concerns with competitiveness, it is   important to bear in mind the historical attempt to deal with the aviation   industry. While the Kyoto Protocol states that the International Civil Aviation   Organization<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><sup>17</sup></a> should take the lead on this issue,   little has been done in the last two decades to collectively cope with this   problem.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>18</sup></a> At the International Civil Aviation   Organization (ICAO), technical information and recommendations regarding   standards have been the core of actions to limit aviation GHG emissions.   However, for several years the EU has warned that, in the absence of more   ambitious measures, it would include aviation in the present ETS.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><sup>19</sup></a> Therefore, one should not think that the EU's decision to fight against the   growing aviation emissions is not necessarily new.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><sup>20</sup></a> For   example, this issue was already evoked when the Council of Environment Ministers   recognized on December 2005 that the inclusion of the aviation sector in the   Community Scheme was an appropriate solution to cope with the problem of   growing aviation emissions.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a result, the Council urged the Commission to bring   forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2006. Posteriorly to the   Commission's proposal, the European Parliament welcomed the initiative through   a resolution and recognized the importance of emissions trading as one   potential solution.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><sup>21</sup></a> To clarify, the EU ETS is a   cap-and-trade mechanism. This means that there is a limit on the total amount   of GHG emissions that certain sectors can emit. Within this cap, companies   receive allowances that can be traded between them as needed. The     limit serves to give value to this transaction and to guarantee that emissions   are being reduced beyond business-as-usual and, most importantly, where it   costs the least. In order to reduce emissions, the total number of allowances   is reduced over time.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><sup>22</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new Directive is not the only instrument to combat   emissions from the aviation industry. Another fundamental reference in the EU's   attempts to fight climate change is the 2020 strategy. This document states   that the EU should aim to set the target for reducing GHG emissions in   developed countries by 30% in the context of multilateral negotiations by 2020.   Irrespective of this outcome, the EU is compromised to the reduction of at   least 20% by 2020, being 1990 the baseline. With the support of the member   states since 2007, this target should be complemented by the following measures<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><sup>23</sup></a>:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.&nbsp; Improving     the EU's energy efficiency by 20% by 2020.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.&nbsp; Increasing     the share of renewable energy to 20% by 2020.</font></p>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.&nbsp; Developing     an environmentally-safe carbon geological storage policy.</font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Given this context, it seems relevant to mention that,   in climate change, the EU sees itself as a frontrunner.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><sup>24</sup></a> This   image of leadership, however, suffered a considerable backlash after the   Copenhagen negotiations &#150; Conference of the Parties 15 (COP-15). Leaving   Denmark with the feeling it "had no friends,"<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>25</sup></a> much attention was   devoted to the fact that the EU was sidelined in the most crucial moment of the   negotiations, when the Copenhagen Accord<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>26</sup></a> was agreed to.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>27</sup></a> However, what this round of negotiations made clear was that international   climate governance is in turmoil. The first evidence for this relates to the   decreased level of ambition present in the final agreement. Thus, the main   message from the Copenhagen Accord was that bottom-up approaches regained   legitimacy.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><sup>28</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In retrospective, several organizations have been   trying to better cope with the impact of aviation on climate. However, it is   fair to say that scientific complexity and uncertainty are major drawbacks to   advance this debate. Notwithstanding the lack of consensus, scientists agree   upon the need to reinforce the practice of inventories as an attempt to better   quantify the impact of this sector. And yet, the fact is that no single   approach exists and uncertainty is a variable to be taken into account.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><sup>29</sup></a> This technical complexity is certainly one of the reasons for the difficulties   in reaching an agreement under the ICAO. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, this paper will show that the fundamental   difficulty in dealing with bunker fuels at present is not science uncertainty,   but politics. In particular, little progress has been made in this organization   because negotiations are divided between those who favor more ambitious   policies and others who defend that fast-growing developing countries should   not be compelled to specific targets. According to the European Federation for   Transport and Environment, the negotiations under ICAO were a "lost decade."   <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a> below illustrates this argument<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><sup>30</sup></a>:</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><a name="tab01" id="tab01"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rbpi/v55nspe/a05tab01.jpg"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite the lack of considerable progress at ICAO,   critics from non-European countries maintained a critical tone against the EU   insisting it acted unilaterally. The anger was significant to the point that   China issued a directive banning its airlines from complying with the ETS.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><sup>31</sup></a> Russia, India and the US are demonstrating their willingness to do the same.   Such resentment became clearer in December 2011 in Delhi, when, in parallel of   a meeting between the EU and the ICAO Council, 26 countries met to discuss how   to oppose the European decision through what is now known as the "Delhi   Declaration."<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><sup>32</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Posteriorly to this meeting, further work was done   under the ICAO Working Paper 50, which elaborated on this declaration stating   that the Aviation Directive was contradictory to Art. 2, paragraphs 2 (aviation   and marine bunker fuels) and 10 (CBDR) of the UNFCCC, as well as the Chicago   Convention.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><sup>33</sup></a> The ICAO council adopted this paper in   November 2011 with 26 countries in favor and all the     8 EU countries against, joined by Australia and Canada (originally supporters     of the Delhi Declaration). Following this movement, in February 2012 another   meeting in Moscow gave continuity to possible retaliation measures against the   EU. The outcome was the "Moscow Declaration," which had as a goal to suspend or   delay the "only functioning system that exists to address aviation carbon   emissions."<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><sup>34</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is relevant to note that the support of the United   States was not consensual, but condemned, for example, by the New York-based   Environmental Fund (EDF) for not having a constructive role in this process and   act as an obstructionist.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><sup>35</sup></a> Similarly, some argue that the idea of   unilateralism is a caricature of the state of the problem. As one analyst says,   "countries cannot be hostage of global inaction."<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><sup>36</sup></a> This   argument echoes the EU's most recurrent explanations for its decision, as the   aforementioned lack of progress at ICAO also illustrates the need for further   action.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On this subject, the year of 2004 was an important   date. After another unsuccessful round of negotiations, the organization   endorsed the opportunity of its member states to incorporate international   aviation in their own emissions-trading scheme. As a result, the EU interpreted   this document as a "green light" for passing the inclusion of aviation in 2008   into law, becoming effective in January 2012. Furthermore, Arthur Runge-Metzer,   International and Climate Strategy Director at the European Commission,   defended the European position stating that "business preferred emissions   trading to other regulation and the airline trade body International Air   Transport Association (IATA) had backed the extension of the EU ETS to cover   aviation in September 2006. ICAO itself, he added, had endorsed an open   emissions-trading system since 2001." This reinforces the fact that the EU's   decision did not come "out of the blue."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To sum up, the perception that no progress was being   made at ICAO is fundamental to understand the EU's decision to "go alone." So   far, the paper showed how difficult it has been to deal with emission from the   aviation sector for technical and normative reasons. In the next sections, I   will examine this regulation from three different angles: legal, economical and   political. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Is the EU directive compatible with present international   law?</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One major concern of analysts is whether the EU's   legislation is consistent with a number of international accords. Three sets of   concerns have been calling the attention the most. First, it is questioned   whether the EU can extend its own regulations beyond its territorial   jurisdiction. Second, critics of the measure have been alerting for the EU's   disrespect of a number of multilateral and bilateral agreements. Finally, there   are doubts about the degree of consistency between the EU's law and the World   Trade Organization (WTO) rules. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In regards to bilateral and multilateral agreements,   the main negative reaction came from the belief that several international   rules were being infringed in the scope of the Chicago Convention, the Kyoto   Protocol and the Open Skies Agreement. In the case of the Chicago Convention,   the complaint is that an illegal charge or an illegal tax on aircraft operators   would be imposed, which is prohibited under Article 15. Since the EU ratified   the Kyoto Protocol, it should comply with the rule that says that GHG emissions   from aviation must be dealt under the ICAO authority. Finally, the same   argument applies for the Open Skies Agreement, which has the EU and the US   agreeing to pursue emissions trading measure within the ICAO framework.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><sup>37</sup></a>As   a whole, the main accusation is that the EU is breaching customary international   law by trying to rule beyond the European Union's territorial jurisdiction. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The accusation of illegality was first brought to the   London High Court of Justice by the Air Transport Association of America &#150; an   association between American Airlines and United-Continental. The London court   then transferred it to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><sup>38</sup></a> Pushed to respond to these critics, the ECJ concluded in December 2011 that the   scheme could not be considered a tax because it was not designed to generate   revenue for the public authorities and was not a pre-established value   according to any specific calendar. Instead, the price of allowances would   reflect free-market forces. Furthermore, it considered that the Open Skies   Agreement was not being violated, as it is meant to prohibit discrimination   between American and European operators. Despite the Court's decision and the   measure being validated and implemented, a number of legal difficulties still   persist.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><sup>39</sup></a> Before exploring this topic, I must   say that the interest of this paper is not to extensively tackle the legal   limits of this measure.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><sup>40</sup></a> Because of the excessive complexity   and the large scope, I will only outline the most important arguments, mostly   within the WTO.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First of all, in the attempt to address the degree of   consistency with the WTO, analysts usually focus on three central interrogations.   One is whether EU law violates the most favored nation and national treatment   obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The other   is whether, in case of a WTO panel, the EU could use the articles dealing with   environmental exceptions. A third point relates to the question whether the EU   scheme could be considered a Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA), in other words a   border tax.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><sup>41</sup></a> According to Bartels, the European   Court of Justice ruled that the scheme does not constitute a tax, implying that   the measure is non-fiscal. Therefore, he believes that it cannot be considered   for the GATT purposes. In his words:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The fact that some of the revenue earned as a result of     such a measure flows back to the state is unimportant. The EU's scheme is more     similar to a law requiring motorcycle riders to purchase helmets. This is     obviously a regulatory measure, and it does not cease to be one just because     the state sells an initial quantity of those helmets. The point is that the     compulsory purchaser retains something of value &#150; indeed, in the case of     emission allowances, this is something the value of which could increase     significantly on the open market."<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><sup>42</sup></a> (Bartels 2012, 16) </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, this interpretation remains   inconclusive. Some analysts argue that, if the EU ETS does not impose an   illegal charge under the Chicago Convention, it "imposes at least an illegal   tax, because emissions are linked to the use of fuel and Article 24 of the   Chicago Convention as well as the EU/US Open Skies Agreement provide that fuel   shall be exempt from duties."<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><sup>43</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After evaluating several angles of potential   incompatibilities with the WTO, Bartels suggests that the EU scheme might   violate a number of obligations under the GATT and the General Agreement on   Trade in Services (GATS). For example, giving selective exemption to certain   airlines or countries, in case they implement a similar scheme, could infringe   the most favored nation principle. However, Article XX, which allows some   environmental exceptions, could justify them in light of climate change   concerns.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><sup>44</sup></a> The obstacle, in this case, is to   comply with the series of additional requirements present in the chapeau of   Article XX. The most contentious issue will then be to prove that the measure   is not arbitrary or unjustified discrimination. In general, the fact that   countries with regulatory measures could claim an exception suggests that   products from non-regulated areas will have to cope with extra costs according   to the distance of the travel that goods need to arrive in Europe. In case of   litigation, this could be considered discriminatory. Another problematic point,   which Bartels points out, relates to the risks of unintended effects of the   scheme. With the objective to avoid the burdens of the new regulation, airlines   could start avoiding direct flights. This would, paradoxically, create an   incentive for more carbon emissions. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, it is still too   early to present a conclusive analysis regarding the competition distortion   resulting from the EU's decision. However, some recent studies have alerted for   the risk of the low impact of the regulation. According to Vespermann and Wald,   "while the system will unfold both its economic and ecologic effects in the   long run, the current system design will not evoke a substantial reduction of   emissions from air transportation. If significant absolute reductions of   environmental industry costs are intended, these reductions can only be reached   by a more restrictive system design."<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><sup>45</sup></a> Given these concerns, the next section   turns to the present estimations of the financial impacts of the Aviation   Directive. </font></p> <h5><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"<i>It's the   economy, stupid!</i>"</font></h5>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The European Commission calculated that the new   Directive would increase in the costs per passenger between &euro; 2 and   &euro; 12, which is significantly less when compared to the non-compliance   penalty of &euro; 100 per allowance.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><sup>46</sup></a> However, this assessment varies. The   industry, for example, normally indicates higher values and favors a global   approach. In interviews with European high civil servants, the question of methodology   was raised. For example, the price of the carbon tone varies and has probably   an impact in the final estimated price. This is a key issue in trying to   establish the real reach of this ruling. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the tax, the EU argues that the cost for airlines is   practicable and estimates that "the scheme could prompt carriers to add between   &euro; 4 and &euro; 24 (US$ 32) to the price of a round-trip long-haul   flight."<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><sup>47</sup></a> In addition, it is expected that the   extra costs will not be paid by the industry, but transferred to the consumers.   For the Commission, the impact on the demand is considered mild and could be   mitigated by expected industry growth.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><sup>48</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While Europeans highlight the "manageable" extra cost,   others argue that this is "just the beginning." As one diplomat affirms, "the   costs are not negligible, because it will all depend of the future prices of   carbon, which can increase considerably depending on the demand."<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><sup>49</sup></a> For others, the main problem is the risks of discriminatory rules under the   environmental label with potential spill-over effects into other sectors   already in the phase of implementation &#150; i.e. Renewable Energy Directive,   Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change Program (REACH) and   Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS). In other words, "what we   observe is that regimes under environmental or sanitary justification of the EU   always mix, in a very fine manner, fair arguments with unfair norms."<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><sup>50</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the specific case of Brazil, interviews also   revealed that the Brazilian government seemed to be more upset by the EU's   decision than Brazilian airlines. Moreover, despite less vocal than China or   India, Brazil signed both declarations (Delhi and Moscow) and supported all   initiatives to retaliate the EU. Interestingly, an air services agreement was   not signed at the last minute during the EU-Brazil Summit in October 2011. One   of the reasons was a paragraph in which the EU requested a license to not be   questioned about domestic measures regarding environmental actions in the   aviation sector.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><sup>51</sup></a> This implies that significant economic   effects can be a reality in the near future. In this case, the weight of the   present economic crisis is a considerable variable that should be taken into   account. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yet, a relevant point of this debate is that the primary   reason for resentment is not necessarily related to the costs of this new law.   This research interestingly reveals that, in some cases, governments and not   airlines associations are taking the lead in boycotting the compliance with the   EU legislation. In conclusion, although the costs are real, my argument is that   this is not what disrupted the bitterness of third countries. In particular, it   is curious to note that those who are the most vocal are not necessarily the   most vulnerable. China is the best example.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><sup>52</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Normative dividend as a powerful reason for discord</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The previous   sections explored the critics towards the EU Directive in global aviation   mainly from the economic and legal aspects. I showed that these dimensions   alone were insufficient to understand the world's reaction against the EU's   measure. In this part, I am interested in developing this argument further. My   goal is to demonstrate that the EU took a significant risk in approving the   rule and must now deal with the unintended effects by using its persuasion   power and its capacity to build international coalitions. At present, non-EU   countries are teaming up to combat a decision that should not be denounced. One   of the tasks of this paper is to point out the serious political implications   of this decision for the EU.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To start, it is worth citing a recent press release by   Lufthansa that stressed the gloomy situation of European airlines: </font></p>     <blockquote>       ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"According to the most recent forecast of the International     Air Transport Association, Europe's airlines are headed for a loss of     US$ 1.1 billion. As late as March, the association was expecting a     loss half that amount and cited the euro debt crisis and the ongoing recession     in several EU countries as reasons for the worsened outlook. Add to those     factors the political regulatory environment, which is undermining the     competitiveness of local airlines. German Federal Transport Minister Dr. Peter     Ramsauer summed up the situation in mid-June 2012, when he said: 'Aviation today     is caught in a toxic mix of burdensome air travel taxes, emissions trading, and     restrictions on operating hours.'" </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This quote puts into evidence how it would be   problematic if several countries decided to boycott the EU's regulation, which   is not unrealistic. For example, Russia declared that overflight rights could   be denied as a pressure measure. India has considered revoking the landing   rights of EU airlines. This is particularly challenging for the future   projections of a billion-euro future market. China has repeatedly stated its   intention to impose punitive tariffs and sanctions, while threatening to cancel   contracts with Airbus. The United States is trying to pass a law prohibiting US   airlines to comply with the ETS.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><sup>53</sup></a> All these menaces are neither positive   for the environment, nor for scaling up a low-carbon economy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, following the Copenhagen trauma, the   official European position remained keen on a robust legally-binding agreement   under the UNFCCC.<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><sup>54</sup></a> However, it is remarkable how the need   for building coalitions gained importance in official statements.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><sup>55</sup></a> Subsequently, the Copenhagen Accord, building support with different partners   to reinvigorate the multilateral negotiations became vital for the EU. In this   sense, the aviation industry certainly challenges the EU's ability to bring   other countries to its side. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In summary, instead of collecting adherent voices to   its cause, the EU provoked extremely antagonistic reactions. The BASIC   countries, the US and the Alliance for Small Islands States (AOSIS) felt   betrayed by the EU's behavior. In the case of the island states, the reaction   is less vocal in the media but not less important. These insulated states will   be affected by any decision due to their high dependence on tourism, which   could particularly suffer from shifts in the price of tickets as a result of potential increases in   emissions due to newly unsustainable routes.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><sup>56</sup></a> The general perception is that the EU lacks authority and disregards key   principles in international law. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This paper, thus,   draws attention to both the effectiveness and the legitimacy challenges of the   directive. Studies and interviews with stakeholders show that, instead of   combating deadlock, the EU seems to aggravate the situation by reinforcing its   lack of trust and transparency. For example, "if many countries were to employ   unilateral measures, this could result in an undesirable fragmentation of   environmental protection."<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><sup>57</sup></a> The first   unintended consequence could be the creation of incentives for conservative   players (i.e. China, India and the US) to retaliate against environmental   regulations. By denouncing the illegality of the rule, they are delaying a sound   solution to the problem. Furthermore, some argue that the implementation of the   EU ETS undermines the role of ICAO, which has a leading role in this matter   according to resolution A37-19116, also signed by EU member states.<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><sup>58</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The solution</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The previous   section showed high degrees of dissatisfaction with the EU's aviation   directive. At present, criticism is so fierce that a global boycott has ensued.<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><sup>59</sup></a> In a context of political stress and multilateral fatigue, one shortcoming for   the EU is that its frontrunner image is being jeopardized. There are reasons to   believe that losing key partners is troublesome not only for the EU as a global   actor but also for the integrity of the multilateral process. As former   Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer says, "a leader is only a leader if it has   followers."<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><sup>60</sup></a> Considering the   present transitional moment, in which new poles of influence are rising, it is   particularly problematic to behave the way that the EU has with regards to   excluding key partners from the process of rule-making. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Instead of   criticizing the EU for taking the first step, this section is interested in   assembling a potential solution for the conflict. One unanimous answer is   "finding a global solution at ICAO." However, it seems difficult to understand   how, after a decade of little progress, countries can all of a sudden agree.   The main point is that aviation needs to be regulated globally and not through   a regional scheme. Interestingly, this viewpoint does not differ from that of   the EU. Most importantly, following this wave of threats, the EU agreed to   revise its decision if a global decision is reached. There are two problems   with this approach. First, non-EU countries feel that they have to negotiate   under pressure in order to find an agreement and avoid paying penalties. As a   European Diplomat states, "the problem is that countries feel that they are   negotiating with a gun in the head."<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><sup>61</sup></a> Several   stakeholders, confirming the level of discomfort, repeated this line of   reasoning. Second, there are signs that the EU also feels uncomfortable for   being pressured to change their own law as "backing off now would symbolize a   lack of credibility."<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><sup>62</sup></a> Moreover, it is   difficult to conceive a suspension of a law that has already been approved. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The EU's decision   certainly forced ICAO to speed up negotiations. At present, four options,   mutually non-exclusive, are on the table: mandatory offsetting, offsetting   complemented by a revenue-generating mechanism, a cap-and-trade scheme, and an   emissions-trading baseline and credit system. However, ICAO works in three-year   cycles. The next round of decisions will be at the General Assembly in 2013.   Given these procedural constraints, experts point to the unlikelihood of a   market-based global system before 2015.<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><sup>63</sup></a> This implies that a solution will most likely not be reached in the near   future. One of the fundamental problems continues to be a conflict between the   UNFCCC, which argues for a principle of common but differentiated   responsibilities, and ICAO's principle of equality among member countries. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first great   challenge of policymakers is to accommodate both principles according to   circumstances and capabilities. This conflict is far from being new. In   particular, it is interesting to note that, despite the union of several   countries behind the Delhi and Moscow Declarations, the position of US airlines   differs from those of developing countries. As argued by Meltzer, "for the US,   the EU legislation should not be discriminatory. All countries must be treated   equally."<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><sup>64</sup></a> In objective   terms, the legislation has little chances to change if no other ambitious   decisions occur at ICAO. Therefore, airlines are progressively concerned about   how they can best comply with the measure and avoid escalating penalties. One   of the alternatives for the industry is to force its own governments to adopt   similar regulatory frameworks in order to gain exemption rights. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, it seems   clear that a real solution can only be found via negotiations. There are signs   that the EU's action added some fuel to the fire. However, old dilemmas seem to   continue to block a multilateral consensus. The question whether the EU scheme   will be postponed or not remains open. What is clear, instead, is that Europe   is not in a position to be indifferent to the escalation of conflict. Neither   is the environment.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion: what is the lesson for the EU?</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This paper explored the reasons for global resentment   against the EU's aviation directive. Drawing from the historical attempts to   regulate the aviation sector with respect to GHG emissions, the analysis maps   out the problem from three different angles: legal, economical and political.   The most substantive conclusion is that the EU's unilateral action created a   normative divide among its main trading partners, putting at risk its future   capacity to persuade these countries to take more ambitious actions in climate   change. This is especially counterproductive given the present state of   multilateral negotiations, which continues to advance at an unsatisfactory   pace. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the EU had the right intention, the method it   chose was unfortunate. By sending a wrong sign to its partners, the EU   aggravated the Copenhagen trauma and the image of a leader "without followers."   The main lesson is perhaps that climate change negotiations need fewer sticks   and more carrots. I showed that the EU gained very little in trying to solve a   complex problem without its partners. Besides accusations of illegality and   unilateralism, the EU put at risk the creation of a patchwork of bureaucratic   and conflicting rules, which, ultimately, could not properly address its main   goal: to cut aviation emissions. Unsurprisingly, this is only one example of a   deeper problem related to the interface between trade and climate rules.   International shipping, for instance, also faces similar challenges to those of   the aviation industry.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><sup>65</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Make climate change about bills, not bears."<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><sup>66</sup></a> This phrase summarizes well the evolution of the climate change debate. Not too   long ago, this issue was stigmatized by ecological images in relation to the   protection of species, most notably the polar bear. Today, governments have   realized how strategic this issue has become. As one of the most important   challenges of our century, the debates have gained importance because of their   strong link with competitiveness policies. There is a shifting perception that   climate change is shaping the daily life of other powerful organizations, most   notably the WTO. Attempts to deal with potential conflicts between trade and   climate regimes lost force in 2010, after building momentum in Copenhagen. This   proved to be only a momentarily pause in a problem that was only starting to   gain prominence.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><sup>67</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lastly, the next chance of better addressing this   problem will be in Doha, Qatar, in the occasion of the 18<sup>th</sup> Conference of the Parties. There, countries will have another chance to find   common solutions for problems that are now deeply interconnected. If they   succeed, the symbolism of the city should inspire the disentanglement of the   moribund Doha Round on Development. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>

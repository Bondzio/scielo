The article presents a study on the process of production of texts written by ten children, during school time, in the elementary class, attended by six years old children. The pedagogical work of the children's teacher is theoretically and methodologically relevant to the study. Two aims were defined: (i) to characterize the strategies used by children to come close to the conventions of the writing system, specially the alphabetic principle and the segmentation of the text in words; and (ii) to characterize the continuous activity of elaboration and reelaboration of linguistic knowledge, from where we think the subject in/of the language. A corpus of 115 texts produced along a semester was analyzed. The methodology utilized is that of indicial investigation, based on Ginzburg (1989). The analysis of the data showed the children's singular and general strategies to come close to the writing system. The children's production is organized, chiefly, according to knowledge originated from the written texts accessible to them. The children's epilinguistic activity was expressed during the whole semester, on different levels. The analysis of the children's procedures pointed out that the process of constructing up written texts is peculiar to each subject; the process is based on social writing and tends toward social writing, in individually different ways.

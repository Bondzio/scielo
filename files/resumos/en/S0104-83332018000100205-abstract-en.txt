Abstract The many steps of the installation of a mining complex in Barcarena, Par√°, have led traditional communities to experience processes of expropriation, displacements and the cumulative effect of environmental crimes committed by companies involved with the project. The existence and ways of living of men and women were drastically changed by this development project. This article addresses resistance strategies of women and men against this imposed project of development. The memories and voices of group of women encompass involvement in the fight for ethnic and territorial rights and strategies for remaining in and returning to their specific territorialities. Scott (1995, 2001) and Brah (2006) support a descriptive perspective on the specificity of women from these traditional communities.

The goal of this investigation is to understand the possibilities and limitations of an experience of continued education for primary school teachers who deal with adolescents from poor neighbourhoods. The study was conducted in 2002 and involved 10 teachers and 15 meetings, which were occasions for sharing reflections on how to minimize violence in the schools. We discussed theories of moral development and carried out educational activities (dramatization, moral dilemmas, and group dynamics) to encourage the emergence of constructive social interaction among the teachers. Meetings were assessed according to hermeneutic methods. In the systematization of results, we initially examined the experience as a whole. Next, we focused on significant pedagogical moments in the meetings, in which the teachers shared with us their educational experiences.

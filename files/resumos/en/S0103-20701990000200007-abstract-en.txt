This article aims to analyze the perverse effects that take place when the left makes as its the issue of difference, that is crucial, defining of rightist traditions. Based upon the Sears case (USA) and the Le Pen case (France), the author points up to the racist, and sexist traps ingrained in arguments that underline and focus difference, particularly in a time in History when conservative forces come up again, and reuse those arguments as though they were theirs, and now shoot them against leftist social movements.

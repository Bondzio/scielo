Abstract This article analyzes human trafficking as a form of labor insertion of migrant populations and not only as an issue of organized crime or human rights. Considering cases of transnational human trafficking in Latin America, Europe and Africa, we analyzed the trajectory of people who found themselves in this situation: how they entered and left, the treatment they received and their agency under these conditions. We find that trafficking reproduces and grows not so much because of sophisticated criminal networks, but because of socioeconomic inequality and the agency exercised by victims in these conditions. We conclude that different types of trafficking imply different forms of labor insertion, and in this sense, states must fight against this illicit trade not only through the criminal justice system, but also by regulating migratory status and job opportunities.

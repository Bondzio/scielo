Abstract The work The Adventures of Di√≥fanes by Teresa Margarida Silva e Orta had diverse editions, but many of them concealed Orta&#8217;s authorship. The purpose of this article is to point out the possible reasons that could have lead to the hiding of the authorship of this novel that raises many questions concerning the female authorship. Starting from the analysis of the work (observing also the dialogue with The Adventures of Telemachus by Fenelon, which is presented as a reference for the authoress) we also intend to discuss the process of camouflage of the characters, hat contributes to the problematizing of the questions related to the feminine and the masculine issues.

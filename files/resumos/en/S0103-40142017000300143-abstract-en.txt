Abstract This article aims to analyze an artistic practice that, in contemporaneity, has gained a vast extension and recurrence: the act of walking. The implications of one's chosen pathway, its aesthetic and urbanistic dimension, are crucial themes in the analysis, which focuses on the artistic production after the 1960s. This approach presents an inventory of the lexicon that has gradually qualified the act of walking in its various meanings. It is from this glossary that the main theoretical considerations about the specificities of walking as an act with aesthetic implications emerge, based on the situationist d√©rive of Nicolas Bourriaud's "radicant" aesthetics.

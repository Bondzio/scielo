This work proposes a consistent approximation between continuous education projects and use of information networks in the field of education. It suggests the concept of "continuous educational environment" as a form of ensuring space for mobilization around the idea of in service learning for projects to have the community's own demands as a starting point. Based on this articulation, it envisions new possibilities for combining projects on a continuous basis, for academic research and collaborative writing of works, stressing the importance of contextualized management of network-based knowledge, explicit and democratic enough to allow the school or school system to be a privileged site for research, pedagogical action and decentralized writing of works.

Abastract This article describes some aspects of female physiology according to what I was taught by the Araweté, a Tupi-Guarani-speaking people of the middle course of the Xingu river (Brazilian Amazon). I will focus on the relation between menstruation and conception, on the difference between menstrual and gestational substances, on the self-fabricating property of semen, on the &#8220;container&#8221; capacity of the female body and on parental restrictions during pregnancy. I will also describe Jahi (Moon) and Iwikatin-hã (the one who lives on the &#8220;other side of Earth&#8221;, or the Owner of the River), two figures associated with the Araweté reproductive universe, and particularly related to female corporeal logics. I will discuss some cosmological elements associated with each of them, as well as the effects of their intercourses with women.

Abstract: The male transnational emigration is an old phenomenon in Cape Verde. Nowadays, in small rural communities, changes regarding activities and social position of the remaining women concerning the occupation of the traditionally male spaces can be observed. Women are occupying that space to provide for their households, as well as a strategy to achieve the paths of emigration. This article analyzes the social and family changes in gender relations that occur simultaneously in the areas of production and domestic spaces in Ribeira de Principal, Santiago Island, Cape Verde, in the context of emigration strategies to Europe.

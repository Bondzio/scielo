This article analyzes the heuristic power of the notion of imagination for the study of religion. From a critical perspective of the Durkheimian distinction of beliefs and practices, the work highlights its importance for understanding the relationships between them. In doing so, literature that employed such a conceptual tool in anthropology and other social sciences is reviewed. Secondly, the association with the image and the imaginary, as well as its liminar and creative condition for the religious change is showed. Finally, two ethnographic cases exemplify the process of imagination in the field of cosmology and religious experience.

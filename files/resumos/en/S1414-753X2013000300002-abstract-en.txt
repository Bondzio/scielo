In the last fifteen years, Argentina became one of the biggest producers and exporters of genetically modified (GM) crops. During this process, issues such as environmental risks, advantages and disadvantages, increasing inequalities between large and small farmers, among others, have been in the core of the debate by several stakeholders. However, small farmers have been absent of the debate. In this paper, results of a study using focus groups on the perception and attitudes of Argentinean small farmers toward GM crops are presented. The results suggest satisfaction by the local small farmers with the new technology, but also concern toward the environmental and social impacts of the genetically modified crops.

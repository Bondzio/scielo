In this paper I present some of the guidelines of an approach which emphasizes the symbolic dimension of the relationships of domination and the ambiguity of the dominated consciousness found in recent Brazilian academic production. Next, I discuss the criticism towards the irrationality of this analytical perspective and outline, in opposition to the first, the criticism towards the compromise this approach has with the rational tenets of the conception of social subjects. Finally, I show the potentialities this kind of approach has on contemporary thought regarding political and social subjects.

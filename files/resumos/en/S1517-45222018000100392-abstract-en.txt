Abstract This work contributes to the studies on modes of scientific knowledge production in Brazil by means of the examination of the flows and mobilizations that helped to constitute the Organizational Learning discipline, in the area of Administration. To this end, the present research draws on a collection of texts that seeks to systematize the main investments and perspectives of the discipline over the last decade. Based on this scientific artifact, we follow the threads connecting people, ideas and institutions around an academic network in expansion in the country. Finally, we present an alternative view on how the field is traditionally characterized.

The aim of this work is to propose a methodology to evaluate the performance of students at Unicamp [SÃ£o Paulo State University at Campinas] from admission to graduation. The sample consists of all students enrolled in Unicamp from 1997 to 2000, and the population corresponds to the universe of students throughout the existence of the university. The available database was gathered from socio-cultural questionnaires applied by the University Commission on College Entrance Examination at the time of enrollment for the examination ("vestibular") and from academic information provided by the Unicamp Academic Studies Board. A methodology is proposed based on the "relative gain" variable suggested by Dachs and Maia (2006). This new methodology is based on the diversity measures proposed by Rao (1982) and on the use of U-statistics. Homogeneity tests have been proposed to assess whether there is a difference in performance among students from different groups.

Abstract This study problematizes a reality of degradation of waterways that are bordered by or surround urban spaces. Lagoa da Francesa (LF) in Parintins / AM is one of those spaces, once preserved and now polluted. On its banks, hundreds of people live and intensely make use of this place. This study investigated the environmental awareness by children living in the vicinity of LF. Qualitative research was developed by drawings and the content presented by children. The participants were 120 girls and boys, between 7 and 13 years old. The categories of perceptions on LF that emerged were: a) Pollution; b) Flood; c) Trade; d) Transit; e) Living; f) Recreation. Such perceptions reflect feelings of attachment or detachment, possibilities or vulnerabilities that children experience from the world they receive from adults.

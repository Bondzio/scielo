AbstractIn recent decades there has been in Argentina and especially in Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area, an increase in the visibility and appreciation of the African and Afro-American manifestations, in the context of an alterity national formation that valorized &#8211;and still valorizing&#8211; an ideal of a white European nation. Under the analysis of the expansion and practice of the Afro-Brazilian religions in the country, discusses how the parallel consolidation of a cultural activism of Afro-American and African manifestations related to the arrival of migrants from these sources, and international, regional and national processes of revisibilition Afro-descendants under multicultural policies that promote also the emergence of immigrant communities, create spaces where the different African and Afro-American diasporic expressions and constructions (religious, ethnic, racial, national) interact one another creating or reactualization common Africanness that decress but does not disappear their differences or legitimacy.

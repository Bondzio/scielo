This paper aims at using a series of practical concepts about    legitimacy, from Weber and Habermas, to analyze the revival and present functioning    of these groups, especially associations based on folk religion. As I see it,    the fact that social groups are able to exist "normally" and to operate, even    though they are not in conformity with the law, should be understood with the    help of three categories: political legitimacy, administrative legitimacy and    social legitimacy. At the end of the paper, I discuss the promulgation of the    "Regulations for the Administration of Social Associations" which sets legal    legitimacy as a core process integrating the three other kinds of legitimacy,    and I examine the effort of government to require all social groups to possess    full legitimacy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Keywords</b>:    Chinese society, folk religion, grass-roots associations, legitimacy.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Resumo</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Os grupos de base    chineses t&ecirc;m tido uma rela&ccedil;&atilde;o complicada com a ordem social    durante os &uacute;ltimos 30 anos.

Their social activities were generally within or    under the name of the unit (in the case of urban residents) or the commune/production-team    (in the case of commune-members) to which they belonged. As the result of reforms    during the past decades, city-dwellers are no longer completely attached to    their units,<a name="n1"></a><a href="#v1"><sup>1</sup></a> and rural dwellers    have turned from commune-members into villagers.<a name="n2"></a><a href="#v2"><sup>2</sup></a>    In these circumstances, individuals feel the need and encounter opportunities    to organize horizontally in associations and participate in new sorts of social    processes. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In a short period    of under 30 years, associations have undergone considerable development, demonstrating    complex relations with various legal, political, and administrative orders and    engendering new social practices. According to certain analysts, from a legal    perspective, existing associations may be classified in four types: 1) legally    registered associations; 2) secondary associations without corporation status    (i.e., those nominally affiliated to legally registered associations but that    are in fact independent); 3) business corporations registered with the industrial-commercial    administrative authorities; and 4) "illegal" associations that are not registered    at all, such as associations operating under the names of "saloons", "tribunes",    or "clubs" etc (Kang Xiaoguang, 1997, p. 630). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Adjusting this    scheme to our needs, we divided associations into three categories: registered,    nominally affiliated (including those nominally affiliated to business enterprises)    and "illegal" associations.<a name="n3"></a><a href="#v3"><sup>3</sup></a> The    second category includes those nominally affiliated to legally registered associations    and those nominally affiliated to and operating within various kinds of enterprises    and institutions. Prior to its registration, an association must be nominally    affiliated to a certain unit. It becomes a registered association only after    official registration. Some registered associations failing to go through the    annual check-up may once again become nominally affiliated associations. "Illegal"    associations include, in addition to those active in metropolitan areas and    named by Kang Xiaoguang, the many traditional folk groups that exist throughout    urban and rural areas, e.g., folk-arts organizations in Beijing, worship groups    and temple fair organizations in the countryside. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is fair to say    that registered associations have a foot-hold within the law, and "illegal"    associations stand completely outside the law. Generally speaking, nominally    affiliated associations are those having one foot inside and another foot outside    the law. Here, the term "outside the law" includes different behaviors. In some    cases, an independently operating association has a unit for nominal affiliation,    but doesn't go through the registration procedure. Others may operate under    the name of an enterprise. This is the mode in which, for example, most <i>qi    gong </i><a name="n4"></a><a href="#v4"><sup>4</sup></a> organizations have    been carrying out their<i> gong-passing</i> and <i>gong-practicing</i> activities.    Still other associations that have their orientation within their units, and    hence are exempt from registration, are in fact operating in the society at    large. No matter what their status in relation to the law, associations of the    above three categories all go about their business and are faring well. This    doubtlessly shows that their existence and operation tallies with a certain    kind of order, although this order lies beyond the realm of law. It is especially    the case of grass-roots associations of folk religion in China which supply    many typical examples and the main concern for this essay.<a name="n5"></a><a href="#v5"><sup>5</sup></a>    In the following discussion, we attempt to show that to understand the <i>de    facto</i> status of associations, "legitimacy" is a better category than "legality".    </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><b><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Four categories    of legitimacy </font></b></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"Legitimacy" is    a concept with complex semantic extensions. According to dictionaries, its adjectival    form, "legitimate", means any of the following: 1) according to law, lawful;    2) in accordance with established rules, principles, or standards; 3) born of    legally married parents; 4) in accordance with the laws of reasoning, valid,    logical; 5) resting on or ruling by the principle of hereditary right; 6) justified,    genuine; 7) of the normal or regular type or kind. The concept of "legitimacy"    is used to denote possession of these properties. In short, "legitimacy" denotes    something having a basis for being recognized, approved, or accepted. As to    what particular basis it is, (e.g., certain provisions of law, rules, standards    or logic), is to be determined by the actual circumstances. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concept of    "legitimacy" is used in social science (sociology, political science, etc.)    in both its broad and narrow senses. The concept in its broad sense is used    in discussions of social order and norms (Rhoads, 1991, p. 167; Weber, 1954,    p. 5-10), or norm systems (Habermas, 1979, p. 204). The concept in its narrow    sense is used in describing a sort of state rule (Weber, 1968, p. 212-216),    or political order (Habermas, 1979, p. 179). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concept of    legitimacy in its broad sense involves extensive fields of society, more extensive    than law or politics, and has great potential social usability. Weber's idea    of a legitimate order consists of morality, religion, custom, convention, and    law (Rheinstein, 1954, p. lix). As Rhoads put it, "in sum, a legitimate order    in Weber's sense consists of empirically valid rules differentiated by their    modes of enforcement into either conventions or laws" (Rhoads, 1991, p. 168).    The rules enforced by special persons and institutions to ensure people's conformity    are laws, while the rules naturally observed by the society are conventions.    Legitimacy means consistency with certain rules; among them, laws are only a    rather special group. Other than laws there are rules such as regulations, standards,    principles, norms, values and logic. Therefore, the basis of legitimacy might    be found in the legal order, but it might be found in certain social values    or practices inherited by the community as well. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In their discussions    of the legitimacy of rule, Weber and Habermas used the concept of legitimacy    in its narrow sense. Legitimate ruling is one of various forms of legitimate    order. It includes acceptance by the ruled. According to Habermas, legitimacy    means recognized value and <i>de facto</i> recognition of a certain political    order (Habermas, 1979, p. 179). A ruling can enjoy the collaboration of the    ruled, because the rules or the basis on which the ruling is established are    acceptable or even approved by the ruled. Theoretically speaking, the ruling    is recognized due to its legitimacy. However, from a sociological point of view,    a ruling is legitimate because it is recognized. This sociological approach,    using recognition as an indicator, is a useful methodological reference for    our study of the legitimacy of currently existing associations in China. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Legitimacy of ruling    as discussed by Weber and Habermas is shown as recognition of those "above"    by those "below". However, discussions in recent years about cultural pluralism    have extended recognition to relations between communities (horizontal recognition)    and relations between those in authority and those being ruled (recognition    of those "below" by those "above"). This sort of relationship forms the "politics    of recognition" between different cultural groups within a community, and through    this process particular cultures or groups with particular cultures acquire    their legitimacy<a name="n6"></a><a href="#v6"><sup>6</sup></a> (Taylor, 1994).    Therefore, when we analyze the legitimacy of an association according to the    recognition it receives, we define the recognition-giving subject as the state,    the government departments or their representatives, the various units or social    associations, as well as individuals in the society. Recognition by the state    or government departments involves giving authorization for the association    to operate. Recognition by units or other associations involves cooperation    or the provision of resources. Recognition by individuals involves the participation    of particular individuals. An association's activities are the public activities    of a group or organization, and the legitimacy endowed by these three sorts    of subjects is the basis for its public activities.<a name="n7"></a><a href="#v7"><sup>7</sup></a>    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another concept    that goes with legitimacy is "legitimation", which means, according to the dictionary,    1) to make or to declare lawful; 2) to admit (a child born out of wedlock) as    genuine; 3) to display, prove or declare lawful, proper or justified, so as    to win recognition or authorization. "Legitimacy" denotes the property of being    consistent with a particular norm, which seems to be something objective, while    "legitimation" denotes a process of actively establishing a relation with a    particular norm, which obviously has its emphasis on something subjective &#150;    an effort with definite intention. "Legitimation" can be understood as defending    legitimacy at a time when legitimacy might be denied (Habermas, 1979, p. 179,    181). In other words, legitimation denotes an effort to reach a certain consensus    about legitimacy at a time when the objective basis of legitimacy is being questioned.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The concept of    legitimation is a powerful tool in analyzing relations between newly emerging    things and norms or orders in an increasingly fragmented society. Legitimation    is necessary only when legitimacy is not automatic, and legitimation is to show    that our behaviour is consistent with certain norms, even though the case may    seem (or actually is) just the opposite. The mechanism of legitimation relies    on the fact that, firstly, due to the fragmentation of social values, there    no longer exist uniform and generally accepted norms, and therefore all concerned    can only seek common grounds in their differences; secondly, the social process    is a process of dialogue, aimed at arriving at a certain consensus over complex    behaviour; and thirdly, any creative action is in fact a breakthrough and something    that should be approved by the existing order. Therefore, legitimation is a    process of extending and restructuring order. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To sum up, legitimacy    involves relations not only with the law, but also with the social order. Legitimacy    is not a problem of being pursued by law, but of being recognized by the society.    Legitimation is then a process of actively proving a positive relation with    the order, not just passively "not running in the contrary direction". </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The theory on legitimate    order that we have outlined above should be helpful in understanding how associations    are faring and operating currently in China. We intend to show, through the    analysis of various aspects of present-day associations, that current legitimate    order in China is compounded, diversified and pluralized. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking at the    temporal dimension, we observe the coexistence of new norms with those that    have enjoyed a long continuity, as well as those long past. New norms, e.g.,    newly promulgated laws and rules regarding associations' activities, are constantly    produced or enacted while, at the same time, among those norms to be reformed,    some are rescinded and some continue to be effective. To make things more complicated,    some completely discarded norms of the past have been revived and are effective    in certain areas. The staging of a folk show at religious festivals serves as    apt example. If the organizers hold the ceremony in accordance with old conventions,    the event will readily be recognized by authorities according to present-day    standards. This overlap in the time domain is a significant characteristic of    a society in its transitional period. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In spatial terms,    activities in rural areas follow a set of norms different from those in urban    areas, and those associations rooted in units have norms different from those    with using neighbourhoods as their base, even though both sorts of associations    are active in urban areas. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking at the    social aspects of this context, we see that China has gone from being highly    integrated politically, economically, legally, administratively and culturally    to being relatively scattered &#150; a process resulting in a lot of what Bourdieu    has called "fields" with independent logics and rules of their own (Bourdieu;    Wacquant, 1992, p. 94-98). Legitimacy in one area does not necessarily mean    consistency with norms of another area. Temple fairs and worship groups recognized    by villagers in accordance with traditional customs do not necessarily enjoy    recognition by local governments. Even those folk worship-groups recognized    by local government may not have gone through proper legal procedures. It is    precisely because the current legitimate order (or the legitimacy of order)    is dependent on fields that the basis of legitimacy of associations' existence    is complicated. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sources of legitimacy    for current Chinese associations are chiefly political, administrative, as well    as including social and cultural traditions, in addition to the law. An association    may acquire legitimacy in one of these four domains, but it may also acquire    legitimacy in all four domains. That is to say, some associations acquire relatively    complete legitimacy, while other associations may acquire only local or partial    legitimacy. The requirements posed for an association's legitimacy by these    different domains have changed over the past thirty years, just as the degree    of an association's need for legitimacy in these domains has changed. Legal    legitimacy became an explicit requirement for associations only after the promulgation    of "Provisional Regulations for the Administration of Social Associations",    finally becoming a rigid requirement after the "straightening out" of associations    in 1997 and the promulgation of the "Regulations for the Administration of Social    Associations" in 1998. While legal legitimacy has gradually developed into a    compulsory requirement, though with considerable latitude, associations still    must seek the social order's acceptance through satisfying political, administrative    and socio-cultural legitimacy requirements. In the following paragraphs, we    propose to discuss the wisdom of a certain group's organizers who founded their    association through local legitimacy and strived to develop it, working for    full legitimacy on three different fronts, viz., through political legitimacy,    administrative legitimacy, and social legitimacy (or social and cultural legitimacy    as manifested by folk norms based on cultural traditions, social customs, etc.).We    will conclude our discussion showing how legal legitimacy is programmed by the    Chinese government as a core process to integrate the other three kinds of legitimacy.    </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Social legitimacy    </b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Social legitimacy,    as we stated above, is manifested as recognition or even participation by certain    people or community accompanied by concrete forms of social justification. Social    justifications may have three kinds of basis: one is local heritage, another    is local common benefit, and the third is consensus regarding rules or arguments.    To have its foothold somewhere, an association must have at least one of these    as its basis. For folk groups, tradition enjoys irrefutable justification. The    organizer of a lion-dance association once expressed this fact in a most convincing    way &#150; "This is not my invention but inherited from our ancestors. Having    been passed on from generation to generation, how could it be disrupted in our    hands?" (Gao Bingzhong, 1998, p. 3). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Folk groups that    exist nowadays often formulate justifications on all possible bases. We can    cite as example the "Dragon Tablet Association" we investigated in a rural area    of northern China. It was organized by the dwellers of Fan village, and was    said to have a long history but was banned when people were organized into People's    Communes at the end of the 1950s. At first, people continued to burn joss sticks    stealthily at night, but then all such activities stopped when the Cultural    Revolution began. It was probably in the year 1979 that villagers resumed enshrining    the dragon tablet. And dragon tablet fairs were resumed in 1987. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The "Dragon tablet"    is a tablet with engravings saying: "Tablet of the Dragon &#150; True Dominator    of heaven and earth, the three worlds, and all the ten directions". There are    nineteen leaders of the association, who take turns keeping the tablet for one    year. On and around the second day of the second month of the lunar year, the    tablet is moved to a temporary shelter for worshipping by more than hundred    thousand people from the neighbourhood, during which time a temple fair is organized    that normally lasts four days. Donations to provide joss sticks and lanterns    and directly as votive offerings to the god amounted to &yen; 80,000 (US$10,000)    a year in the beginning of the 1990's and more than &yen; 40,000 (US$5,000)    in recent years. The leaders claim to "have kept themselves "clean and honest"    through their faith in the "dragon tablet". The council in charge of the temple    fair declares that "everything taken from the people will be used for the people",    and the money is used primarily for receiving troupes that come to give performances,    for entertaining guests, for assisting families with financial difficulties,    and for improving conditions of local schools. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The "Dragon Tablet    Association", it may be observed, is part of local tradition, and from the beginning    of its resumption it has enjoyed what Weber called "Traditional Legitimacy"    (Weber, 1968, p. 36). It has also inspired a yearly fair which facilitates economic    intercourse among people of the area. Therefore, it also has a basis in public    welfare. Moreover, its income and expense conforms to the generally accepted    rules of the neighbourhood and, in this sense, operate in an acceptable way.    The Dragon Tablet Association, with ample justifications, has thus won the recognition    and merited the participation of the local people, demonstrating its social    legitimacy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most folk groups    at their inception do not go through the legal process. They can exist without    legal legitimacy because, like the Dragon Tablet Association, they have acquired    social legitimacy through traditional ceremonies. There are now nearly a hundred    such traditional folk-arts organizations in Beijing. Each one of them has gone    through the traditional ceremony of celebration at their inception. For revival    of an old organization, experienced organizers must first have various kinds    of stage props, such as "lions" or drums, and a team of performers who are adept    at using these props with sophisticated skill. When everything is ready, the    leaders, instead of going to register at the civil administration department,    will select an auspicious day for the celebration ceremony, and invite several    older, still-living leaders as well as leaders of other friendly or related    organizations. Traditional folk-arts organizations cannot be founded independently,    but have to be shown approval by the presence of these leaders, people of the    same occupation. In the past, the celebration ceremony alone could endow a folk-arts    organization with ample legitimacy, but today it serves only to convey social    legitimacy.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The question of    social legitimacy in the modern nation-state has posed new requirements to folk-arts    organizations. These organizations are active at the grass-root level. They    are founded and kept operative only because they have a certain social legitimacy.    However, the monopoly of violence and symbols by the modern nation-state has    left society with no more than relative autonomy. The present relation between    state and society has reduced the social legitimacy of folk-arts organizations    to a limited legitimacy to operate in a limited sphere of social life, in limited    ways. The organizations now face pressure to meet the requirements for legitimacy    in other respects as well. When a folk-arts organization, worship group, or    temple fair has developed to a certain stage or level, it eventually will have    to deal with legitimation problems in other respects. If it operates only in    a village or in a neighborhood, social legitimacy alone might be sufficient    to guarantee its smooth operation. But if it is to operate or has influence    over a larger area, it will have to acquire legitimacy in other respects, or    it will encounter unbearably repressive administrative, legal and political    forces. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Social legitimacy    is extremely important not only for these folk groups, but also for many other    associations. Project Hope of China Youth Development Foundation has enjoyed    great success only because the idea of education held by the CYDF has won extensive    recognition by the society. Now that the government is no longer providing funds,    if an association is unable to gain a certain level of social recognition, it    will not have the necessary resources for operation, not even the basic fund    for registration. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Administrative    legitimacy</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Administrative    legitimacy is a formal legitimacy based on procedures and practices of the bureaucratic    system. Administrative legitimacy of an association depends on recognition by    the head of a certain unit.<a name="n8"></a><a href="#v8"><sup>8</sup></a> His    recognition usually extends naturally into participation, which in turn shows    his recognition as a matter of course. The form of his participation is quite    flexible. It might be either practical or symbolic, such as holding the position    of an "honorary chairman". If the organizers of an association ask for permission    and report in accordance with administrative procedure, duly notifying the authorities    of all relevant activities, acting always with the approval of all unit or department    heads concerned, then they can operate within the space formed by the unit itself    and its effective sphere of influence, even though the association does not    enjoy legal legitimacy. If the organizers of the association are themselves    administrative officials of certain rank, the association will naturally enjoy    administrative legitimacy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Administrative    legitimacy has extraordinary significance for Chinese associations and their    operations. In a certain sense, the administration of associations in China    is an extension of the administrative system with the unit as its foundation.    As mentioned above, China's associations can be classified, with respect to    legal status, in three categories: registered associations, nominally affiliated    associations, and illegal associations. We can also differentiate existing associations    in terms of social structure into three types: corporation associations (those    that have acquired corporate status through registration), unit associations    (those whose activities are limited to within a unit), and folk associations    (those that are not registered nor nominally affiliated to any unit). Administrative    legitimacy is particularly vital to the corporation associations and unit associations.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Administrative    legitimacy is a prerequisite for corporation associations. According to the    provisions of the "Regulations for Social Associations," no association can    qualify as a corporation unless it finds a responsible unit. That is, a responsible    administrative or quasi-administrative unit is a fundamental condition or prerequisite    for an association to consolidate its legal standing. If an incipient association    is unable to find a unit that will agree to grant it administrative legitimacy,    it will not be able to request, much less be granted legal legitimacy. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Administrative    legitimacy is even more vital to unit associations, since the unit is legally    entrusted with full power in management of all associations within the unit.    These associations are exempt from registration. To these associations, the    unit is actually a legal and administrative system all in one. For instance,    there are usually many associations in universities, even tens of them in larger    universities. In order to enforce better administration, some universities have    issued regulations for the administration of associations within the university.    These regulations show that the unit is exerting administrative control over    association activities. For example, Provision 13 of the "Regulations for the    Administration of Student Associations" of a well-known university stipulates    that "any association, prior to conducting any activities, should send in an    application to the university Youth League Committee, and, after being granted    consent following preliminary review, hand in a budget report of its activities.    No activity should be organized until the entire program of activities is approved.    Those responsible for the association should give the university Youth League    Committee an oral or written report after completion of said activities." Provision    15 stipulates that "any association to conduct joint activities with other units    within or without the university should seek prior consent of the university    Youth League and send in certification by cooperating units along with the program    of activities. No activities should be conducted until these are reported by    the university Youth League Committee to higher level authorities or relevant    units and approved thereby." In other words, the operation of these associations    is entirely regulated by administrative procedures. Their proposals and programs    can be implemented only after acquisition of legitimacy through administrative    mechanisms. Compared with corporate associations, unit associations have less    autonomy and greater dependence on administrative legitimacy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For folk associations    that generally lack legal legitimacy, administrative legitimacy also has a practical    significance. Folk associations enjoy social legitimacy limited to the grass-roots    level and can operate only within a very limited space. However, in the course    of their activities, they end up involving administrative departments of all    levels &#150; an involvement which helps these associations go beyond the limitations    of a grass-roots society. Dancing and singing troupes of folk-arts organizations,    worship groups or temple fairs usually operate within the neighborhood or village,    but certain activities organized by the administrative units allow them to conquer    a wider audience. For example, in Zhao County of Hebei Province, the Bureau    of Cultural Affairs organized an annual competition of folk-arts organizations    and awarded certificates of merit to the winners, who then proudly displayed    these certificates during their participation in temple fair ceremonies. In    Beijing during the Spring Festival, the Chongwen District government sponsors    the Longtan Lake temple fair, the East Metropolitan District government sponsors    the Temple of the Earth fair, and the Chaoyang District government sponsors    the temple fair held at the Temple of Dongyue. During the fourth month of the    Lunar Year, the Mentougou District government sponsors the Miaofeng Hill Golden    Top pilgrimage temple fair. The fairs unite within their framework those folk-arts    organizations usually scattered in the neighborhoods, and these organizations    in turn transform their certificate of participation in these activities into    a vague administrative legitimacy (or an impression of administrative legitimacy)    and use it as a basis for justifying their public operation. Some organizers    apparently consider that their associations acquire a certain legitimacy through    participation in these administratively authorized activities. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To distinguish    the administrative legitimacy of the association from that of its other aspects    may further help us understand the importance of administrative legitimacy.    The administrative legitimacy of an association may be obtained once and for    all from a certain unit (e.g., when a corporate association becomes affiliated,    or when the unit association obtains approval to be founded), but administrative    legitimacy may also have to be obtained step by step, because the space for    association activities may vary among different units and some activities may    even go beyond a single unit. Therefore, whether a corporate association or    a unit association, if it is to get on with its activities, it will have to    get in touch with various units and seek approval or support from the authorities    concerned. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The administrative    system gives an association a certain degree of legitimacy based on its usefulness.    Units and departments consider associations as elements of their activities    or as part of their social resources. On a small scale, many local governments    invite folk-arts organizations to perform, warming up the atmosphere at ceremonies    in memory of martyrs during the Spring Festival or in honor of military men's    families on Army Day. On a larger scale, local governments may use temple fairs    to stimulate markets and promote the economy. For instance, "Jingxi Tour Agency"    (in Beijing) is a corporation controlled by the Mentougou District government,    Beijing. One of its economic mainstays is the income from tourism to Miaofeng    Hill, the main attraction of which is the temple fair together with the pilgrimage    to "Bixia Yuanjun" (Goddess with Azure Glow). And the Miaofeng Hill temple fair    that resuscitated in the 1990s is formed with the participation of folk-arts    organizations from various districts and counties under the sponsorship of the    Mentougou District government. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Political legitimacy</b>    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Political legitimacy    involves intrinsic qualities of the association such as its purpose and the    intention and meaning of its activities. Political legitimacy denotes that the    association or its activities conform to certain political norms, that it is    "politically correct" and hence acceptable. An association chooses its own purpose    and shows the meaning of its activities in the course of its operation. If these    are accepted, especially by the Party system,<a name="n9"></a><a href="#v9"><sup>9</sup></a>    the association has thus obtained a certain legitimacy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Political legitimacy    is vital to the existence and development of associations. It is a problem to    be solved first of all in order to have any existence in China's public space.    China's administration of associations emphasizes the administrative mode of    control. It takes associations as an extension of the state unit system, and    administrative control of any unit sees maintenance of political order as its    primary obligation. Therefore, to get a unit for affiliation an association    must satisfy the requirements of the political norms. Passively speaking, it    should not "run contrary to the norms".<a name="n10"></a><a href="#v10"><sup>10</sup></a>    Positively speaking, the association is best served by making contributions    to the existing political order. Only under such conditions will the unit leaders    allow the association to use their administrative resources and to operate within    their administrative space. Only then will the association have any possibility    of success in becoming a corporation. Even after an association has turned into    a corporation, the leaders of the unit, with resources in their hands, will    still continue to evaluate its activities in terms of political legitimacy and    react accordingly. Associations with neither legal nor administrative legitimacy    will use social and cultural legitimacy to make their appeal while using political    legitimacy to respond to pressure from the administrative and law enforcing    departments. For example, they might say, "Yes, we do not have your permission,    nor have we registered, but what we have done is right in nature." Usually they    would thus be exonerated. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of its    importance, political legitimacy is a <i>must</i> for associations. Associations    are technically autonomous organizations of the masses, but they are generally    quite conscious of their double function as a kind of state political unit and    will take on certain political responsibilities to reinforce their political    legitimacy. To be "politically correct", as defined in state-promulgated regulations    for the administration of associations, is a passive requirement, meaning "no    violations". However, most associations explicitly state their intention to    show a positive political attitude. For example, the alumni association of Peking    University (founded in 1984) stipulated its purpose as "to strengthen relations    between alumni, to carry forward the good tradition of Peking University, and    to make contributions to the development of our alma-mater, to the socialist    modernization construction and the reunification of our motherland, and to the    rejuvenation of China." The charter adopted by China Folklore Society (founded    in 1983) stated its aim as "to uphold the four cardinal principles, carry on    the policy of 'letting the hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of    thought contend', unite those working on the folklore of our country to investigate,    collect, process and research on the folklore of our country's different nationalities,    and make contributions to establishing Marxist-Leninist new folklore with Chinese    characteristics, to transforming social traditions, to enhancing socialist material    and moral civilization, to promoting overseas cultural intercourse and to enriching    the cultural treasures of the world." Apparently the political aspirations of    these associations go much higher than the bottom-line of the state. This underlines    how associations are in dire need of political legitimacy to survive. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To maintain its    political legitimacy in an ever-splintering society, an association needs to    make skillful maneuvers. "Politically correct" is a subjective judgment. It    forms the basis of legitimacy only when this judgment becomes the consensus    of all concerned, and the easiest way to reach this consensus is to affirm it    in the association's explicit purposes, as in the above examples. However, to    pass judgment on the activities of an association is a much more complex problem.    In a country where social strata and cultural values are undergoing sharp changes    and divides, it is the general rather than the exceptional case that people    would have different interpretations regarding the political significance of    the same action. As a matter of fact, an association and its activities may,    in its main or direct aspects, be quite different from the current political    norms, and the above-mentioned consensus might not be reached naturally (or    spontaneously). In such circumstances, the association will have to produce    (or form) this consensus through its own efforts. This is called legitimation,    in the course of which some activities that started out as vague, contradictory    or negative may turn out to have positive value. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Associations have    produced "politically-correct" consensus by using various tactics. For instance,    the China Youth Development Foundation initiated "Project Hope" to seek donations    for poverty-stricken students to complete their primary education. This is a    project to make amendments for deficiencies in the government's education policy.    To be implemented, it had to arouse sympathy and get donations from people.    Hence it revealed the misery of children deprived of education, a revelation    that implied political criticism of social injustice. However, its overwhelming    success relied precisely on its utilization of politically legitimate administrative    resources. Its organizers did not openly criticize government mistakes, but    instead made every effort to publicize the concern leaders of the party and    state<a name="n11"></a><a href="#v11"><sup>11</sup></a> expressed for this project,    as well as other sorts of positive political values they extracted out of Project    Hope to the state.<a name="n12"></a><a href="#v12"><sup>12</sup></a> As a result,    what people generally perceived was the project's positive political meaning,    a perception that guaranteed ample political legitimacy from the Party and government.    "Project Hope" owes its great success to the great political wisdom and skill    of its organizers. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A folk group's    effort in seeking political legitimacy presents another example of this complicated    maneuvering. The dragon tablet enshrined by the "Dragon-Tablet Association"    of Fan Village was originally a tablet representing the God of the Land<a name="n13"></a><a href="#v13"><sup>13</sup></a>    or a group of gods.<a name="n14"></a><a href="#v14"><sup>14</sup></a> But around    the year 1990, as the dragon-tablet fair grew in scale, intellectuals of the    Dragon Tablet Association (native villagers and non-natives) gradually reached    unanimity in stating that the dragon tablet represented the "Gou" Dragon &#150;    Successor of the Dragon. The organizers had this verdict printed on pamphlets    and included in the history of the "Dragon Tablet Association". Giant horizontal    scrolls were unfurled at gathering places, saying "All descendents ofYan Di    and Huang Di are successors of the Dragon". Results of questionnaires applied    to villagers of Fan Village as well as to visitors, in 1998 and 1999 respectively,    showed that 72% of the villagers from the Fan Village and 50% of the visitors    thought that the god of the dragon tablet was the ancestor of the Chinese people.    "Successors of the Dragon" is a slogan to enhance cohesion of the Chinese people,    and has been endowed with the profound political significance of patriotism.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the past five    years, the concept of "intangible cultural heritage" has become very popular.    The central and local governments now recognize many items of folklore and folk    religion (which had been treated as symbols of backwardness and superstition    for decades) as valuable culture. The concept of cultural heritage has become    a category of political rectitude. The Dragon-Tablet Association's organizers    made new scrolls during the 2005 fair with saying such as "The Dragon Tablet    Fair is an Intangible Cultural Heritage". Through reproduction (reinterpretation    and publicity) of its original meaning and identity, they have transformed their    worship from something that might well be rejected by the outside world into    something people cannot but admit is politically right. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Political legitimacy    is a rigid requirement, but <i>which</i> political norm applies and how compatible    it is with the nature of an association are flexible issues. Political legitimacy    is a form of restriction, however it also provides political rhetoric for creating    new interpretations. As a result, it provides a certain cover for social dynamics    and vitality. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Investigation of    various associations' statements about their political purposes and significance    suggests that they have three ways of demonstrating their consistency with the    political order: 1) consistency with the ideology and values upheld by the state    (e.g., socialist moral civilization); 2) consistency with the goals of the state,    especially the central task (e.g., economic construction); and 3) consistency    with policies of the state (e.g., united front and maintaining stability). The    key to political legitimacy is not what is done but what is spoken. Political    legitimacy depends particularly on the process of interaction. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Legal legitimacy    as the core of integration</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When they began,    many associations had only one sort of legitimacy: political, administrative    or social and cultural, hence their operation was based on one aspect. Legal    legitimacy was the last and the least important requirement, proved over time    to be a requirement that could be disregarded. However, the time when associations    could exist with just one sort of legitimacy is finished. Since the promulgation    of the "Regulations for the Administration of Social Associations"("Regulations"    in brief) in 1998, the government has imposed comprehensive requirements of    legitimacy on associations, which now must be politically up-to-par, administratively    affiliated, compliant with legal procedures, and supported by the society. None    of the above can be omitted. Among them, legal legitimacy is the only genuinely    rigid requirement. According to regulations, social groups have to register    with the Department of Civil Administration in order to become legal groups    recognized in law, or they will be punished. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Apparently legal    legitimacy is considered a core process, designed to integrate the other three    kinds of legitimacy, and so the government expects all associations to possess    full legitimacy.The Regulations require all social groups to hold political,    administrative and social legitimacy as well as legal legitimacy. The 9<sup>th</sup>    entry of the Regulations reads "before any initiator applies to the registration    bureau to found a social group, he must have his application censored by the    units in charge and acquire their permission." The censorship and permission    of concerned units means that the social group must pass the test of political    and administrative legitimacy. Furthermore, the 10<sup>th</sup> entry states    that any social group is expected to have certain resources and civil capacities    &#91;such as a certain number of members, fixed location, legal source of property    and financing, operation outlay from &yen; 30,000 ($3,750) to &yen; 100,000    ($12,500),etc.&#93;. Social legitimacy is the premise of all these conditions,    because society is the only place where associations can find their members    and supporters, property and financial resources. We can say that social legitimacy    is the base on which associations can make room for themselves in society. Apparently    these three kinds of legitimacy are prerequisites to legal legitimacy as well    as channels for the state and society to exert their influences. The state,    through the Party and administrative authorities, holds the power for endowment    of political legitimacy and administrative legitimacy, while the general public,    acting according to its own interests, decides whether or not to endow associations    with social and cultural legitimacy. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With abundant resources,    some associations, such as China Youth Development Foundation and China Tea    Friends Association, can satisfy the new legal requirements. However, others    have a hard time coping with them. Experienced secretaries are undone by the    required registration fees. Even some academic associations which, up to now    were doing well, find it is hard to adapt to the new requirements. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other associations,    such as folk groups, are finding it nearly impossible to gain legal legitimacy    under the new Regulations. For the folk-arts organizations in Beijing, the most    difficult condition is that they must affiliate to units in charge. No government    unit &#150; neither the Propaganda Department, nor the Culture Bureau, nor the    Tourism Bureau &#150; is willing to take political and economic responsibility    for them, even though the various temple fairs bring promise of economic prosperity.    We can say the main problem of academic associations is an economic one, while    the main problem of folk groups is that of administrative affiliation. While    there are exceptions (the "Dragon Tablet Association" has successfully combined    its dragon worship with national ideology, transforming a temporary shrine into    a "Dragon Culture Museum"), most grass-roots associations in China have been    hampered by the new law. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The "Regulations    for the Administration of Social Associations" issued in 1998 brings home the    message: an association either enjoys all four kinds of legitimacy, or it does    not exist at all. Nonetheless, within the categories of folk groups and illegal    associations, there will continue to be many associations for quite a long period.    In a society where several contradictory orders coexist, there is bound to be    a mechanism for acquiescence embodying compromise (Weber, 1954, p. 9). This    will leave some room for the operation of different types of associations as    well as a unique field for further study. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BOURDIEU, Pierre;    WACQUANT, Loic J.

<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="tit1"></a><a href="#tit">*</a>    This research was launched by the China Youth Development Foundation and funded    as a program of "Association Studies" (02JAZJD840002) by the Foundation of Research    Centers of Human and Social Sciences under the Ministry of Education of the    People's Republic of China.    <br>   <a name="v1"></a><a href="#n1">1</a> Some have been separated from the unit    system. Those that remain within the system see considerable changes in their    relation with the unit, i.e., the unit no longer holds all-round responsibility    for the individual, and the individual owes only limited obligation to the unit.    <br>   <a name="v2"></a><a href="#n2">2</a> Commune members are attached through the    commune to the state, while villagers are autonomous and have to arrange independently    their own productive labor and cultural life.    <br>   <a name="v3"></a><a href="#n3">3</a> "Illegal" doesn't necessarily mean criminal.    It just means that such associations have not gone through legal procedures.    <br>   <a name="v4"></a><a href="#n4">4</a> Qi gong, or qigong, is a Chinese traditional    energy acculturation, e.g., a Chinese system of prescribed physical exercises    or movements performed in a meditative state.     <br>   <a name="v5"></a><a href="#n5">5</a> We should bear in mind that grassroots    associations of folk religion in China, although they can barely register and    attain legal status as worship groups, have survived tough political circumstances,    enjoying increased popularity during the past decades. The different forms they    take on will be discussed below, including folk-arts organization and temple    fair organizations. Though the religious function has never been abandoned,    these associations wisely resort to traditional, cultural and administrative    tactics tosediment their legitimacy.     <br>   <a name="v6"></a><a href="#n6">6</a> For examples using the concept of legitimacy    in these ways (i.e., horizontal recognition and recognition from above), see    Gutmann (1994, p. 5).    <br>   <a name="v7"></a><a href="#n7">7</a> Kang Xiaoguang (1997, p. 636) mentions    that associations in China have to simultaneously gain two kinds of legitimacy:    official legitimacy and social legitimacy.     <br>   <a name="v8"></a><a href="#n8">8</a> Business enterprises and institutions are    not themselves public administrative departments, but their leaders also belong    to the ranks of public personnel, and perform administrative functions. They    too are therefore sources of administrative legitimacy.    <br>   <a name="v9"></a><a href="#n9">9</a> One of the characteristics of the Chinese    system is the existence of a professional political system in addition to the    administration system, which consists chiefly of the Party and Youth League    system. They examine associations, looking for political standards consistent    with the political order and grant or deny the association political legitimacy    accordingly.    ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<br>   <a name="v10"></a><a href="#n10">10</a> All of the government regulations on    associations list certain fundamental political norms that must not be violated,    e.g., no contradictions with the four cardinal principles, no harm to national    reunification or to the unity of the Chinese nationalities, etc. Thus the regulations    are formal as well as substantial.     <br>   <a name="v11"></a><a href="#n11">11</a> For a comprehensive report on the participation    of important leaders, see the section on "Waves of love from Zhongnanhai" in    "For the Future of Our Motherland &#150; A report on the seven years of operation    of Project Hope" (<i>Journal of the China Youth Development Foundation</i>,    1 November 1996).     <br>   <a name="v12"></a><a href="#n12">12</a> For example, "Project Hope" is a new    growth point in the construction of socialist moral civilization. (<i>Journal    of the China Youth Development Foundation</i>, 1 August 1996).     <br>   <a name="v13"></a><a href="#n13">13</a> The God of the Land is also known as    "Dragon Fude"     <br>   <a name="v14"></a><a href="#n14">14</a> Perhaps they are called "Dragon Tablets"    because they incorporate engravings of dragons. I have discussed this conclusion    with Professors Ye Tao and Liu Tieliang using the results of their investigations.    </font> </p>      ]]></body><back>

Abstract In Canada today the issue of human trafficking is high on the public agenda. A variety of activities are included under the rubric, including &#8220;homegrown&#8221; or domestic prostitution, where crossing either national or internal borders is not a requisite for state definitions of trafficking. Canada does not stand alone in this attention for an expansive definition of human trafficking. Globally, sex work/prostitution, &#8220;sex trafficking,&#8221; child labour, undocumented migrant labour, and &#8220;modern slavery&#8221; are integral to hegemonic discourses on &#8220;the horrors&#8221; of human trafficking. In this paper I look more closely at three prominent campaigns that sustain this discourse and discuss some of the work that these campaigns do. I argue that a closer examination makes visible a twenty first century version of the &#8220;white man&#8217;s burden&#8221; supported by contemporary western, corporate, neoliberal interests, through which the unfettered exploitation and abuse of working people&#8217;s lives and labour continues. So, rather than getting to &#8220;the bottom of things,&#8221; I argue here that dominant discourses on human trafficking tend to obfuscate structural problems and revitalize imperialism in new ways.

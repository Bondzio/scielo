Abstract In this paper, I propose to describe some aspects of a recent movement around the so-called "medicines of the forest", mainly the nixi pae (ayahuasca) of the Huni Ku&#297; (Kaxinawá). The proposal includes the monitoring of continuous flows between the "forest" and the "city" of the nixi pae, the so-called pajés and the emerging groups around them, evidencing ontological conflicts and connections. A significant contribution of this work may lie in feeding reflections in the ayahuasca research field from a cosmopolitical proposition (Stengers, 2007), which will seek to take nixi pae as a technology of connectivity. Thus, it is hoped to unfold the semantics of terms like cure and medicine through the pragmatics of collectives (of shamans, substances, spirits) in action: what effects do these generate when they act in network, what moves, what strengthens, what is left behind. The nixi pae will then appear as a key element in the activation of ontologically heterogeneous collectives, opening possibilities for encounters with otherness in attempts of composing spaces of coexistence.

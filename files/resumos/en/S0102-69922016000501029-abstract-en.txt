Abstract It is proposed in this paper to study the contribution of four intellectuals, who worked in the beginnings of the University of Brasilia, Brazil, to the marxist theory of dependency. Texts and memorials written by them as well as two interviews recently made are used as sources of information, besides the usual bibliography about the subject matter. Evidence was found that the University of Brasilia has been the place for theoretical disputes between structural functionalism and marxism, for the need to lay foundations for the analytical production of these intellectuals with the methodological and theoretical contributions of marxism, for making the criticism of the conceptions of the relations between countries that are part of the world system as developed and underdeveloped, without implicating a relation of exploitation among them, while the references of a general formulation of the theory of dependency were more as roots and beginnings, there including the mechanism of a double exploitation, either by the national bourgeoisies or by the international capitals. The paper indicates the militant formation of at least three of the four intellectuals in the ranges of Polop (Marxist Revolutionary Organization - Proletarian Politics) and its influence over political action and over the need of a socialist revolution,

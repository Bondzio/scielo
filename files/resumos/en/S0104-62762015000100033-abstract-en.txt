What is the effect of campaign financing on the behavior of congressman? This article analyzes the vote of Brazilian federal deputies (1999-2007) in relation to the projects of interest to the National Confederation of Industry (CNI). Methodologically, the article combines descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis to test the hypothesis that, the higher the campaign financing by industry, greater parliamentary cooperation with the interests of this sector. We use cluster analysis, logistic regression models and Poisson to estimate the effect of campaign financing on cooperation. The results confirm the hypothesis partially. Relationship between industry funding and cooperation of parliamentarians was not found, but it is confirmed that the proportion of corporate resources influences positively the cooperation of Brazilian parliamentarians with the interests of the CNI, controlling by different variables. These results align to the international literature about the subject that finds a positive relationship between campaign contributions and Congressional behavior.

Abstract The degree in which social movements can thrive in alliance with political parties is a relevant question for participatory democracy. This article discusses the ambiguous effects of the alliance established between a group of young hip-hop artists and politicians in a Brazilian big city located in the state of Sao Paulo in the 2000's. It explores an interactionist perspective of activism, conceptualizing it as a dynamic social activity and stressing its temporal dimension. Based on in-depth interviews with members of the hip-hop group and party leaders, the study shows how the relationship established between them allowed the youth to actively contribute to the development of the city's hip hop movement and to be recognized as it's spokespeople. Over time, though, their increasing dependence from the party hindered their artistic production, and gave room for internal competition, leading to the group dissolution. By showing how these relations developed, the study reveals the possibilities and limits of social movements dependence from political parties, especially when the later win executive positions in government.

This article analyzes the Dossiers of Revista Estudos Feministas. This section is published since the appearance of the journal on 1992. We describe each one of the 24 dossiers published until now and analyze it main characteristics. The main objective of the Dossiers is to establish a dialogue between the feminist academic discussions and the feminist activism and politics. They are open to different styles of text beyond the academic paper. In the end of the article we analyze the place of the dossiers in the discussions about the tensions between academy and activism, trying to go beyond the dichotomies between action and reflection or between theory and practice.

This article argues for the need to develop a revolutionary decolonial epistemology and identifies two obstacles for the development of a new epistemology: one related to epistemology itself and the other to issues of identity. There is a need for purposeful and reconstructive discussions about truth, as well as reconstructive discussion about how and by whom knowledge is produced. On the other hand, the assumption that any and all claims for identity is marked by an excess of essentialism is also an obstacle. Instead, there should be more reliable explanations of reality that can assess the context in which identity-based movements become narrow and conformist but also when they mean an expansion of political participation and coalition building.

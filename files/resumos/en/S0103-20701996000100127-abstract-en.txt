This essay examines the most recent forms of the corporatist theory, especially its democratic patterns &#8211; called neo-corporatists. Positive experiences in the social, economic and political fields, particularly those developped in European countries, have drawn corporatism away from the strong stigma generated by fascist practice, regaining importance as a social sciences theme. In Brazil, the birth of the automobile sectoral chamber at the beginning of the nineties revealed the emergence of neo-corporatist mechanisms in the industry, sectorially limited in an intermediate level. This experience, politically and economically effective, is analysed as a mesocorporatist institucional arrangement.

This paper intends to contribute to the analysis of the current transnational movements from the feminist criticism standpoint, showing the cultural representations imbricated in the social divisions of work. I analyze the division gender, kinship and sexuality in connexion with the gender representations of Dominican international migration to Spain. This work is based on an ethnographic study done in the southwest of the Dominican Republic and in the city of Madrid (Spain).

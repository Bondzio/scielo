THIS ARTICLE is an attempt to synthesize the important role played by Octavio Gouvêa Bulhões in Brazil's economy. Considered a model Brazilian liberal, Bulhões was a remarkably active civil servant. Founder of Banco Central [Brazil's national bank] and SUMOC [a superintendency for the local currency and credit] and finance minister from 1964 to 1967, he was outstanding for his constant preoccupation about financial and monetary issues, mainly concerning inflation. In tune with the line of thought which had Eugênio Gudin as a leader, Bulhões published academic works dealing with economy policy issues focussing mainly on stability, in his view a fundamental factor for economic growth. A university professor and member of the Instituto Brasileiro de Economia, Octavio Gouvêa Bulhões, both for his life and work, is one of the most important referential names to understand Brazilian economy.

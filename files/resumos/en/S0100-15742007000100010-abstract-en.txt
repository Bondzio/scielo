This article presents some results of a field research carried out in 2002 with the aim of understanding how History teachers in the secondary school represent the school historical knowledge produced daily in their relationship with the students. The research was formulated based on Henri Lefebvre's representation theory and adopted an interpretative participant observation methodology proposed by Frederick Erickson. Four government school teachers in the State of Sao Paulo were observed during the whole academic year. The data analysis suggests that the teachers' representations are marked by a systematic opposition to the so called.

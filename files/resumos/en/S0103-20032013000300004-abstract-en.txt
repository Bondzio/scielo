Paran√° State is a leading fine table grape producer in Brazil, and is characterized by the presence of small and medium producers. This study aims to analyze price transmission asymmetry (PTA) among producer, wholesale and retail levels from January 1997 to October 2011. Vector Autoregressive (VAR) was used to determine how price transmission occurs among players. The model used for PTA measuring was based on the methodology developed by Griffith and Piggott (1994). Results shows that, in the price transmission to the retail, wholesale presented a greater elasticity coefficient than the producer level; the Granger wholesale-retail unicausality is an evidence of asymmetric information; and price increases are transmitted faster than decreases, which, added to Griffith and Piggott's t test results, confirm the existence of price transmission asymmetry.

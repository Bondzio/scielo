Abstract: For this article, I chose the following analog principle: if there is a &#8220;minor literature&#8221;, an expression that Deleuze and Guattari apply to the work of Franz Kafka, why not also think of a &#8220;minor history&#8221;? Indeed, the female narrative, marked by memorials clippings to be told, narrated and described, enable the emergence of marginalized and invisible speeches by traditional history. It is this smaller story - this female memory, rather subjective, family nature, emotional and maternal and neglected by official memory - I propose to analyze. In this perspective, the history of women, to be seen as a minor story, would have the power to produce, through lines of flight that builds itself, discontinuities in the official story.

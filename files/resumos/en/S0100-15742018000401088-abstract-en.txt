ABSTRACT The objective of this article is to show how Education interest groups are organized to defend antagonistic interests regarding the constitutional regulation of devices that define the allocation of public resources to private education. We support the existence of a theoretical model, based on the concept of centralization, which describes the organizational strategies of interest groups in the areas of Health Care, Labor and, as shown in this case study, Education. Our results show that in this area the Fórum Nacional em Defesa da Escola Pública na Constituinte (Fórum) [The National Forum for the Defense of Public Schools Under the Constituent Assembly] and the Conferência Nacional dos Bispos do Brasil (CNBB) [National Conference of Brazilian Bishops] have centralized opposing interests, and their organizational patterns are compatible with the proposed model. The data are shown using social network graphs and are based on institutional historical analysis.

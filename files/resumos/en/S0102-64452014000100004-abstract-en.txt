Iris Young, in a work published posthumously gave an important contribution to the theory of social justice based on the concept of responsibility and of what she called "model of social connection", which retrieves the individual and their responsibility as far as injustice is concerned, in order to analyze the various forms of the individual relationship to the social structure. The article in question will examine the main theoretical constructs of Iris Young, it will analyze the relationships that the author proposes between subject and structure, the heuristic value of their theses and their limits. The article initially show the distinction between guilt and responsibility, will pass to the discussion of the concept of responsibility vis-Ã -vis the social structure, and describe the social connection model proposed by Iris Young.

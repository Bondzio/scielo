Abstract This article aims to discuss certain issues of the genocide in Cambodia, which occurred between 1975 and 1979, through the documentary Bophana, a Cambodian tragedy (1996), directed by Rithy Panh. At the center of the narrative is the correspondence established between the protagonist and Ly Sitha, her husband. For Panh, this correspondence represents the individual&#8217;s resistance to the Khmer Rouge regime by expressing two elements seen as harmful by the totalitarian State: love and culture.

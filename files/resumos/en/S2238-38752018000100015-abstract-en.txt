Abstract In this interview, Elide Rugai Bastos, Gabriel Cohn and Mariza Peirano address some of the main aspects of the academic and intellectual trajectory of Florestan Fernandes, particularly the current relevance of his work, its key theoretical findings and its political and ethical dimensions. The three specialists review, for example, the capacity of concepts like bourgeois autocracy, competitive social order and periphery to interrogate contemporary realities. They also discuss the multiple relationships between sociology and anthropology, history and theory, centre and periphery, universities and social movements, past and present in the social scientist&#8217;s work.

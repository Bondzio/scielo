ABSTRACT The study specifies key indicators for managing local education systems of public education in Chile, as there has been significant and recurring shortages in this sector. Therefore, it is necessary to move forward in this area, especially because the gradual transfer of the institutionality of the local education authority to a new form of organization (Local Education Services) started in 2018.This transfer is extremely relevant to solve the problems detected, asthat can be done through correctly measuring and processing the problems. Based on a qualitative methodology, which in its turn was based on consultation with the main units for local public management education, some indicators are identified and validated, providing a set of variables of simple application, which allow these units to improve their information for better management.

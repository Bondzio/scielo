Abstract This article aims to understand the contemporary political-religious conjunture in Brazil focusing on two fronts: on one hand, the performance and political values of the most prominent evangelicals on the national scene and, on the other hand, on the growing conservantism in the country. The argument is that a segment of these religious groups is articulated along lines of force in different dimensions (economic, moral, security and interactional) of the social process in progress in the country, and that they configure what has been denominated with relative imprecision as a &#8220;conservative wave&#8221;.

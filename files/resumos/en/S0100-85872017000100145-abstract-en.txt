Abstract This is an analysis of the values underlying the speeches of the parliamentarians who voted about the impeachment of the President of the Republic in the Brazilian National Chamber of Deputies, in what regards especially the references to religion and family; considered here as a symptom of the strength of moral criteria in a context where the civic values characteristic of modern republican ideology should prevail. Some analytical models allow for a discussion of Brazilian political culture, mostly in what regards the lower strata of society.

This paper deals with cultural and consumption practices and lifestyles, in the                context of the current social and economic downturn in Portugal. One of the most                striking features of the ongoing transformations is connected with the increase of                social inequalities regarding the access to goods and other resources that                characterize a knowledge society and to the greater use of information and                communication technologies. Contrary to some views about the irrelevance of a                conception of social classes, we intend to develop a perspective of "middle class",                by identifying standardized social principles for structural differentiation of                resources and opportunities. This theoretical-analytical approach to the middle class                also aims to comprehend the repercussions of a context of economic recession and                deepening inequalities, situating this social segment. This proposal is based on the                empirical results of a (online) study on the income and consumption of middle-class                families in Portugal, carried out at the Centre for Research and Studies in                Sociology, Lisbon University Institute (CIES-IUL) in the last quarter of 2012 and                developed as part of the Project Thinking the future and finding new                   prospects for the sustained promotion of well-being and quality of                life.

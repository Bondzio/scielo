The aim of this article is to discuss how the affection and pleasure dynamics intersect with the social inequality in the gay and lesbian circuit in Rio de Janeiro city. Part of the life trajectory of two young black homosexuals living in the carioca suburbs, and one living in Mar√© slum, will be more particularly approached. The field work emphasized that, in this context, the darker male homosexuals living in suburbs and slums in Rio de Janeiro have a broader range of action than those in which young heterosexual male and female and even lesbians and transvestites of different color living in these areas are inserted.

Abstract In this article, we seek to analyze the uses of Antonio Gramsci&#8217;s thought about India with Subaltern Studies. We will focus on the analysis of the group&#8217;s first phase, throughout the 1980s, influenced by Gramscian thought and the leadership of the historian Ranajit Guha. Our objective is to situate subalternist discussion within the context of Gramsci&#8217;s ideas dissemination in peripheral contexts, adopting as counterpoint the Latin American case, in particular through the production of Argentine and Brazilian Gramscian followers. In addition to focusing on highlighting the internationalization of the Italian Marxist ideas, we seek to examine, in an underlying way, how Marx&#8217;s own work was rethought in these contexts from Gramsci&#8217;s influence, with the hypothesis of being attempts of Marxism translation to the periphery of capitalism. We tried to demonstrate this hypothesis through detailed analysis of subalternist theses, as well as to suggest meeting places with Latin Americans, especially those linked to the &#8216;Pasado y Presente&#8217; and &#8216;Presen√ßa&#8217; journals.

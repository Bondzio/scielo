This study seeks to examine the determinants of the duration in employment in all Northeastern states of Brazil for the years 1993 and 2003. In order to do so, we used the data from the National Survey per Residence Samples (PNAD) which is done by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), every year. Results obtained by the parametric model showed that the duration of the relationship of employment is higher for men and older workers. With regard to the regional aspect, it was found that residents in the states of Pernambuco and Bahia - precisely those with the highest unemployment rates - have higher turnover when compared to other northeastern states.

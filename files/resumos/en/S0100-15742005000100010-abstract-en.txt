Data from two studies focusing on secondary education in Ceará enableb a two years monitoring of the development of the educational reform in eight state schools in Fortaleza. The results show that the 1990's policies introduced a new rationality in Ceará's system allowing, among other objectives, to confront the old patronage structures. However, despite some enhancements, basic contradictions of the project became obstacles to the achievement of its initial goals.

Abstract The interview focuses on the anthropological perspective of Tim Ingold, his particular way of understanding ecological relationships between organism and environment. To unravel the author's theoretical perspective, the dialogue follows through his formative years and theoretical influences, as well as the relationships established with other theories in the context of contemporary human sciences.

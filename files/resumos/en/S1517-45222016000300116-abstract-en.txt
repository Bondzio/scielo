Abstract On the night of 2-3 December 1984, an accident in the Indian subsidiary of the US company Union Carbide Corporation (UCC), located in the city of Bhopal, would unleash the world's worst industrial disaster: the Bhopal disaster. In this paper, based on a recent ethnographic fieldwork, more than 30 years later, an encounter with the voices of those whose lives have been affected by the Bhopal disaster This approach intends to convene readings over time, violence and demarcations of humanity that define the social memory. In particular, the processes by which some lives are disproportionately exposed to violence and the paths through which some forms of suffering tend to be erased from the social memory of the West are questioned. Finally, the spaces of enunciation and resistance created within the biographical and corporeal vulnerabilities imposed by the disaster will be addressed.

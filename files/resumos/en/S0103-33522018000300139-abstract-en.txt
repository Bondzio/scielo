Abstract The study analyzes the influences of the Brazilian Young Parliament (PJB) on the political behavior of the period 2006 to 2014. Data from a survey with a sample of 29.17% of the public attended by the PJB during the period, including quantitative Descriptive techniques and statistical inference. The results point to a lasting and comprehensive cultural change at the level of political attitude expressed in the growth of political trust in the Legislative Branch and, to a lesser extent, in political parties. Social involvement, characterized by interest and motivation for the debate of social issues, and civic engagement by following the political agenda and by participating in civil associations are expanding significantly. The formal political participation in party activities also shows growth, however, occurs predominantly among men and graduates who also engaged in the student movement.

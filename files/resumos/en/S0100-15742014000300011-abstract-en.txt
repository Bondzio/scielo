Based on the human rights manuals cited in the bibliography of the Law program syllabi of the state of Rio Grande do Sul as thecorpusof analysis, we present three characteristics frequently found in the recounting of the history of human rights: the statute of the historic source, the notion of historic evolution and the claim to neutrality. We are supported by the statement that the mode of recounting the history of human rights has direct implication in the definition of what these rights are. On the one hand, the historic narrative establishes possible connections between human rights and specific themes (for example, family law). On the other hand, it inhibits or prevents connections between human rights and other themes (for example, business law).

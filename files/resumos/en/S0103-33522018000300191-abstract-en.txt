Abstract The article defends the hypothesis that Joseph Schumpeter in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, rather than constructing an elitist and procedural theory of democracy based on the institutional method of selecting rulers competing for popular vote, was in fact deeply concerned with the operability stable and poised of method once erected. With this in mind, Schumpeter went on to argue that the socialist parties would not only have a fundamental role in the structuring and working conditions of the democratic method, but would be essentials for its permanence and consequently for democracy.

Abstract: Pérégrinations d&#8217;une paria is Flora Tristan&#8217;s initiatory Peru travelog published in 1838, in which she seeks her paternal protection. This is the first publication that makes Flora Tristan a known author. In this article, I defend the idea that Pérégrinations d&#8217;une paria, like hers Nécessité de faire un bon accueil aux femmes étrangères (1835), formulate a theory of social struggle, undertaken by Tristan on her return to Europe, which has as a starting point women&#8217;s freedom acquired by freedom of movement, the ability to travel and to compare her own society with other societies, acquiring social and political consciousness in this process.

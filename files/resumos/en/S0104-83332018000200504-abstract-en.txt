Abstract This is a reflection about the discursive strategies used by the British film &#8220;Black Narcissus&#8221; (1946) when dealing with erotic and racial signs facing Christian and Indian cultures in a colonial context, in the era of the Hollywood Production Code. We propose a dialogue among the different premises of Georges Bataille, Octavio Paz and Michel Foucault who dissect the issue of human sexuality and it&#8217;s repressive mechanisms from different perspectives. We emphasize the need to expand the issue of eroticism beyond polarized notions such as prohibition and transgression when dealing with non-Western societies and their subtle gradations between the sacred and the profane.

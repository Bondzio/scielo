The Sociology of Education in Brazil is being questioned, since the late 1980&#8217;s, by the very researchers who develop it. This movement of self-reflection takes on a new analytical front in the present article, a more detailed examination of the place occupied by the field of education within the Brazilian graduate programs in sociology. Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, the article analyzes data and information originated from different sources, as the electronic pages of CAPES, the graduate programs studied, and the Lattes curricula of the researchers involved in the field. From the study of these agents, their formation trajectories, areas contemplated, research projects, publications and orientations, the scope of the field itself gained important significations in terms of its composition and academic production. The data on the researchers and institutions analyzed point to education as a relevant theme in the research agenda of Brazilian sociology.

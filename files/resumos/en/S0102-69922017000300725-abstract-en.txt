Abstract During the last years, in different national contexts, emerged debates about what religious and non-religious groups call &#8220;gender ideology&#8221;. This paper tries to retrace this term&#8217;s genealogy to comprehend the political grammar in which it works. With this objective, the paper investigates texts that defined &#8220;gender ideology&#8221; around twenty years ago, maps where it emerges in Latin America and when it starts to be used against sexual and reproductive rights. Human rights&#8217; demands have been understood by moral enterpreneurs as threats to status quo creating, at the same time, a moral panic and a discoursive field of action.

Abstract: This article analyzes the tolerance to the breaches of the norm in Medellin and municipalities in Metropolitan Area. For this purpose, we use data from the study about magnitude, distribution and factors associated with violence in Metropolitan Area of Medellin that was conducted in 2004 to ten of its municipalities. In this study was estimated the magnitude of this important risk factor for violence on society. Results emphasize that the standardized indicators of anomie and legitimacy to the breach of the rule are surprisingly high in all municipalities in the Metropolitan Area of Medellin, for both men and women, although most prevalent among men, children and youth. Sociological arguments are presented to provide elements that explain the presence and characteristics of this phenomenon and the factors that motivate a person to cause an incident that contributes to this phenomenon. Among the explanatory values are mentioned both inadequate and lack of certain cultural values, the result of sociocultural constraints and economic situation as individual rationality.

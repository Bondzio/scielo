Abstract: The problem of a society based on private property of productive forces are the unequal and unjust conditions of producing economic wealth and political power. The bourgeois legal concept of private property is a paradigmatic combination of the reification of universal concepts and class-interest. An exemplary case is Hegel&#8217;s Philosophy of law. The essay tries to reconstruct the idea of democratic socialism as a still workable alternative.

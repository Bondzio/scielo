How can quantitative and qualitative techniques be mobilized to assess the impact of public policies? This paper aims to present the basics of impact evaluation and discuss the main techniques used to quantify or qualify the impact of policies. Therefore, we present the controlled experiment and quasi-experimental techniques as tools to identify the causal effect of policies, and observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups as ways to observe the impact on the beneficiaries&#8217; quality of life. Different techniques are presented with practical examples of public policies. The results indicate that quantitative and qualitative approaches answer to different questions in the evaluation. However, both are fundamental to evidence-based policy making.

While in 1992 two international conventions &#150; United   Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the United Nations   Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) &#150; were signed and several policy   documents were approved (Agenda 21, Rio Declaration on Environment and Development,   Statement of Forest Principles), two decades later the UN Conference on   Sustainable Development (UNCSD) adopted a "legally non-binding outcome   document": <i>The Future We     Want</i>, calling for a green economy in the context of sustainable   development (SD)   and poverty reduction, an institutional arrangement for SD, a framework for   action and follow-up.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the first Earth Summit in Rio established a   framework for international climate governance with legally-binding commitments   for developed industrialized countries (Annex-1, UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol   (1967) adopted quantitative emissions limitations and reduction obligations   (QELROs) for Annex B countries, two decades later global climate governance was   paralyzed due to a failure of its Conference of Parties (COP) in Copenhagen   (2009), Canc&uacute;n (2010) and Durban (2011) to adopt a legally-binding post-Kyoto   climate regime once the obligations adopted under the KP expire by the end of   2012.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Annex-1 and Annex-B countries, the Group of 8 (G-8)   shares a major responsibility for this policy failure, together with other G-20   countries, which contribute more than 80% of global GHG emissions. Three G-8   countries face a climate paradox due to their inability to implement their   legal obligations and policy declarations for GHG reduction targets for 2050.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What are the legal obligations of the G-8 under the   UNFCCC and KP? Which political commitments did their heads of state and   governments declare for reducing their GHG emissions until 2050? How did their   GHG emissions change from 1990 to 2010? Why did the climate leaders of 1992   become climate laggards in 2012? Why did the four European G-8 members   (Germany, UK, France and Italy) and most if EU-27 succeed both regards? The   second thesis is that sticking to a business-as-usual approach may result in   high economic costs and major international and human security consequences   during the 21<sup>st</sup> century (EU 2008; UN 2009; Brauch 2009; Scheffran,   Brzoska, Brauch et al. 2012). The chapter concludes calling for   alternative national and regional strategies of sustainability transition in   the energy, transport, production and consumption sectors resulting in a   low-carbon economy and reducing potential resource conflicts by shifting to   renewable energy.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Legal obligations of the G-8 under UNFCCC (1992) and KP   (1997)</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The UNFCCC distinguishes industrialized countries   (Annex 1) with general obligations and other nations defining its goals (Art. 2)   as: "stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a   level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate   system" and that this "should be achieved within a timeframe sufficient to   allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food   production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a   sustainable manner." In Art. 3 paragraph 1, the parties agreed that they would   "protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations   of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but   differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities". Under Art. 4, the   Annex-1 countries "shall adopt national policies &#91;and&#93; &#91;...&#93; measures on the   mitigation of climate change, by limiting its anthropogenic emissions of   greenhouse gases and protecting and enhancing its greenhouse gas sinks and   reservoirs," and take "the lead in modifying longer-term trends in   anthropogenic emissions," recognizing "that the return by the end of the   present decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide   and other greenhouse gases &#91;...&#93; would contribute to such modification." They   would also aim to return "individually or jointly to their 1990 levels these   anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases," and they   "shall provide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full   costs incurred by developing country Parties in complying with their   obligations under Article 12, paragraph 1" and "they shall also provide such   financial resources, including for the transfer of technology, needed by the   developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of   implementing measures."</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on the Berlin Mandate (1995), the Kyoto Protocol   (KP 1997) contains specific QELROs to implement these policies and measures,   including:</font></p>     ]]></body>

The G-8 confirmed the IPCC findings and supported the goal to   stabilize the increase of global average temperature at 2 &deg;C above the   pre-industrial level by 2100. From 2007 to 2011, the G-8, in their annual   summit declarations, i.e. in May 2011 in Deauville (France), declared as the   goal:</font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">of developed countries reducing emissions of greenhouse     gases in aggregate by 80% or more by 2050, compared to 1990 or more recent     years.

Based on this review of long-term and recent global GHG emission trends, the   performance of the G-8 with regard to their legal and declaratory obligations   are assessed based on data of Eurostat (2011), IEA (2011) and UNFCCC (2011) for   Annex B countries (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>). </font></p>     <p><a name="tab01" id="tab01"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/rbpi/v55nspe/a03tab01.jpg"></p>     ]]></body>

Most of the 25 EU   Annex B countries submitted five national communications to the UNFCCC (<a href="/img/revistas/rbpi/v55nspe/a03tab02.jpg">Table 2</a>). GHG emissions for most of EU-27 countries declined from 1990 to 2009. With   the EU enlargements of 2004 (EU15+10) and 2007 (Bulgaria, Romania), ten   transition countries joined whose emissions had dropped with the collapse of   their socialist system in 1989.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The GHG emissions of the EU-27 were   4,614.5 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents in 2009 and they   had declined by 17.4% or by 974 million tons since 1990. But in 2009   the drop by 7.1% or by 354.5 million tons was largely due to the   world economic crisis. According to a Eurostat report, by 2009 the biggest   increases occurred in Spain (+26.8%), Portugal (+24%), Greece (+14.5%) and   Ireland (+14.5%) accounting for 13.6% of the EU total. Spain (+11.8%) and   Ireland (+1.5%) were also above the targets of the EU's burden-sharing   agreement. As these countries are severely affected by the financial crises,   with their declining economic growth their emissions will also drop.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Among the EU-27, the four largest countries (Germany,   UK, France, and Italy) were responsible for 54.9% of the GHG weighted emissions   in CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents.

The share of RES in electricity consumption reaches 64% in a High Energy     Efficiency scenario and 97% in a High Renewables Scenario that includes     significant electricity storage to accommodate varying RES supply even at times     of low demand.

With this Energy Roadmap 2050,   the European Commission offered a policy perspective arguing that the goals   proclaimed by the heads of states and governments at the G-8 level (2007&#150;2011)   are technically feasible but that the transformation would require a strong   political will and a sense of urgency among policymakers. To achieve the   20/20/20 EU targets by 2020, Germany, the UK and France adopted ambitious   national GHG reduction goals, policies and measures.</font></p>     ]]></body>

After the   change of the coalition of the CDU with the liberal FDP, this goal was upheld;   however, under the assumption that the running time for nuclear reactors would   be extended,     a goal that was revised in May 2011 in the aftermath of the nuclear catastrophe   in Japan.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>11</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the UK, the legally-binding Change Bill of 2007   adopted a target of a 26% to 32% reduction in GHG emissions by 2020 and of 60%   reductions by 2050 through these principal measures: a) improving energy   efficiency; b) stimulating consumers to become producers at home; and   c) investing in the development of low-carbon fuels and technology.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup>12</sup></a> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">France adopted a strategic energy law of July 13, 2005   (Grenelle 2) that </font></p>     <blockquote>       <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">sets a target of reducing national emissions 3% per year.     &#91;...&#93; The government aims to reduce the energy consumption of public buildings by     at least 40% and to cut their greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2020. &#91;...&#93; In the     renewables sector, Grenelle 2 sets a goal that 23% of France's energy use must     come from a mix of renewable energy sources by 2020. &#91;...&#93; The law shifts the     focus from national energy security &#91;...&#93; to energy efficiency. &#91;...&#93; Grenelle 2 marks     a shift away from environmental regulation and toward a broader sustainable     development agenda. </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In July 2009, the French Parliament adopted the   Grenelle 1 bill.

They are also committed to GHG   reductions by 30% to 40% by 2020. Thus, in the area of international climate   policy, the EU has clearly become the leader of a policy strategy that calls   for a decarbonization of its economy by 2050.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusions</b></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With regard to the reduction targets of the KP, since   1990 the G-8 countries have shown a mixed performance.

The EU-27 have   clearly met their overall targets under the KP and most member countries have   met their national targets under the EU's burden-sharing agreement (1998) based   on the KP. Only Canada and the US have clearly failed to stabilize their GHG   emissions by the year 2000 to the level of 1990 and to achieve the GHG   reduction targets to which they agreed when they signed the KP. </font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As both the European and North American countries are   liberal democracies, the different performance cannot be explained with the   system of rule. To explain this fundamentally different performance and   especially the fundamental change in public opinion in the US regarding climate   change between 2007 and 2012, additional factors must be considered, such as   the different political culture in North America and in the EU, the different   role of economic interest groups, of powerful lobbies, of the conservative mass   media and of a powerful, inward-looking and ideology-driven grassroots movement   focusing at the Republican Party that prevented the climate change   implementation legislation in US Congress. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The climate paradox hypothesis applies specifically to   these two laggards in climate change performance. Canada and the USA share   extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita and the same "way of life",   which is a part of the North American political culture and of the values,   attitudes and behavior of most citizens. With the assumption of the world power   role during the 1940s, the prevailing thinking on the role of the US in world   politics and especially of the role of its military tool has significantly   changed, as have the dominant theories of international relations from Wilsonian   idealism to Hobbesian realism. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The prevailing mindset of business-as-usual and the   cornucopian vision that assumes that climate change can be solved with market   mechanisms and technical fixes (geo-engineering) are further mental obstacles   that restrained the political willingness to launch a new long-term   transformation of its economic, cultural, social and political system. Radical   climate skeptics portrayed climate change as a major threat to the American way   of life and jobs (Klein 2011). </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The efforts by ultraconservative climate skeptical   movements to attack and delegitimize the IPCC fundamentally contradict the   American optimism in scientific progress. Thus, the necessary long-term   transformation and the sustainability transition (Grin, Rotmanns and Schot   2010) require in the USA and Canada both a fundamental change of their dominant   worldview and consumerist culture, of their values, belief systems, and of the   attitudes and behavior of the people and fundamental transformation of the   energy system aiming at a progressive decarbonization. This challenges powerful   sectors of the economy, the interests of business groups and also of the trade   unions representing these old economic sectors.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proposed new scientific revolution (Clark, Crutzen   and Schellnhuber 2012) and the need for a new paradigm shift towards   sustainability require to gradually overcome the dominant worldview of the   people and the mindset of their political leadership. In international   relations, severe crises have often become a driving force for leaning,   innovation and change, as the response of Nixon and Kissinger to the Vietnam   War indicated, or Gorbachev's efforts to save the socialist model by initiating   a new thinking and reforms from the top. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overcoming the climate paradox in North America   requires a deliberate climate leadership of the EU countries and a sustained   willingness to unilaterally implement their climate reduction goals and the   different roadmaps for 2050. Implementing a sustainability transition with   increasing energy efficiency reduces energy costs and enhances the   competitiveness of European products. It may also reduce the dependence on   fossil imports and thus the involvement in resource conflicts over the control   of fossil energy resources.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overcoming the climate paradox requires a gradual   replacement of the thinking and action in terms of business-as-usual towards   multiple sustainability transitions in all sectors of the society, of the   economy and also in the political realm. To move towards a Fourth   Sustainability Revolution (FSR) requires major changes in the dominant culture   and way of life, in the dominant societal, economic and political worldview of   the citizens and the mindset of their leaders, but also in the forms of   governance to curb the influence of political money on the behavior of the   elected representatives of the people. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus, a dual strategy is needed, a readiness of the   people to support such a fundamental change of their culture and way of life,   and a willingness of the political and economic elites to induce and invest in   a long-term transformation of its energy, transportation, housing   (heating/cooling), production and consumption systems towards sustainability.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Bibliographic references</b></font></p>     ]]></body>

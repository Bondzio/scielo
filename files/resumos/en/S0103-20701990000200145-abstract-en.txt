This article aims to rebuild some aspects of Th. W. Adorno's musical-sociological critique. The author starts from some paragraphs of Philosophy of Modern Music, where Adorno analyses Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. He takes for sure the premise that says Philosophy of Modern Music is quite a divagation through Dialectic of Enlightenment, and seeks for reaching their inner relations. The analysis and criticism of the theme of sacrifice in The Rite of Spring spots this point. The article goes on trying to find out whether that so-called sacrifice fits the idea of annihilation of subject repeated regularly in Adorno's work. At last, it is pointed up to some fundamental premises of Adorno's critique, by chasing after any relationship between Adorno's work and Weber's on Sociology of Music.

Abstract This article assesses the normative resistance to Responsibility to Protect adopted by Brazil and Russia against the backdrop of their international identities and self-assigned roles in a changing global order. Drawing upon the framework of Bloomsfield&#8217;s norm dynamics role spectrum, it argues that while the ambiguous Russian role regarding this principle represents an example of &#8216;norm antipreneurship&#8217;, particularities of Brazil&#8217;s resistance are better grasped by a new category left unaccounted for by this model, which this study portrays as &#8216;contesting entrepreneur&#8217;.

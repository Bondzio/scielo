The souls of plants cultivated by the Jarawara come out of the bodies when they are young. They are nurtured in villages at the nemê, the upper layer, although they are the children of those who cultivate them. The article reflects on Jarawara kinship through the relations between humans and plants, in dialogue with the ideas of "nurturing parents" and marriage. Throughout the article, I focus on the concept of the namosá, a way to embellish, repair, transform and renew relations and everyday life, or an aesthetic of living that blends with care and seduction.

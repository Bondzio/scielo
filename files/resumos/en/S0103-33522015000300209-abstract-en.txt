This paper seeks to demonstrate the political importance of Procedural Law to reforms of Brazil's Judicial system, as well as the political role played by Procedural Law experts in conceiving and conducting such reforms. It starts by examining the institutional characteristics of Brazil's system, seeing the unitary character of Procedural Law in Brazil as a comparative advantage over the fragmentation of bureaucratic agencies and professional careers in that system. It then takes a sociological approach to offer an explanation based on the existence of a legal field that is broader than the formal institutions of the judicial system. In this legal field, agents, identified as an intellectual elite, without necessarily occupying leading positions in the State framework, make use of their symbolical power to achieve privileged access to the political processes of reforming the judicial system.

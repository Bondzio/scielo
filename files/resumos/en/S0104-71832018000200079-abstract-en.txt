Abstract Considering the reflections of a young Guarani who has, as probable destiny, to become a shaman (karai), the bet of this text is ethnographic. Driven from him, a friend that I have been able to follow for about nine years, we are led to diverse speculations about the universe and its inhabitants. Combining a mythopoiesis disposition through philosophical exegeses, and willing to bodily understand whites with his jurualogy, Vera&#8217;i has increasingly revealed his propensity for Mbya shamanism, mainly motivated by his family members since his childhood, but corroborated when some came to seek him for healing and treatment for their illnesses.

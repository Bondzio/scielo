The themes proposed in this paper -- gender and citizenship -- lead us to seek analytical references wide enough to be able to think about how they are articulated. Concepts of citizenship and the construction of gender identity have been defined through an understanding of society based on the dichotomy of the private and public as responsible for disqualifying women from the public. Contemporary feminism discusses this viewpoint, criticizing it and proposing new approaches that permit the integration of men and women through their relationships in the development of social processes.

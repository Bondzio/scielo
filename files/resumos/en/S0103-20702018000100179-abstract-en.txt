Abstract This article addresses the apparently rather old question as the citation from the 1851 issue of the Scientific American indicates &#8211; of how to assess and measure the value or price of knowledge. We will probe the issue from a variety of social scientific and practical perspectives. Against the background of a sociological concept of knowledge economic, political, social and juridical perspectives are discussed that may lead us to a price of knowledge.

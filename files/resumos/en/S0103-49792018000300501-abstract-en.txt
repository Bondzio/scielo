The category &#8220;sub-imperialism&#8221; is one of the most important contributions of the Marxist theory of dependency (MTD). Immersed in the Latin American problematic and, in particular, in Brazil, it provides one of the key theoretical-methodological keys for the understanding of the dynamics of the economic, social and political crisis of that country in the convulsed and complex international and regional context. The objective of this essay is to revisit the concept of sub-imperialism and to highlight its explanatory validity of the economic and political phenomenology of present-day Brazil.

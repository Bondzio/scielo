Abstract In water scarcity situations, water rationing is a management measure taken in order to ensure equitable access to water. The current study presents some factors that contribute to a situation of water injustice in Campina Grande, a city located in the Brazilian semiarid region, which has been facing a new drought cycle since 2012. The water supply conditions in the households and the users' perceptions about the impacts on their water use routines were monitored for 6 months. Two variables were considered: household income and water shortage risk. Among the main conclusions, the following stand out: (1) the higher the household income is, the higher the water storage capacity and the lower the impacts on the household routines; (2) the poorest sections of the population tend to naturalize the restrictive impacts of the water rationing since they have experienced and lived in a permanent state of water saving.

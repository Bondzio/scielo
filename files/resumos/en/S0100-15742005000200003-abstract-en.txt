This article presents the results of a research carried out in Quebec on the needs, expectancies, representations, and knowledge among education system agents concerning the forms, modalities, and practices that they use, and that they may and should use in the process of transferring and disclosing teaching research results. Semi-structured interviews with the main agents of the education system (researchers, people in charge of teaching associations, unions, and the Ministry of Education) and a study conducted with teachers are the material on which we have based our methodology. Data synthesis gives us clues for solving the difficulties presently faced in making university researches known to teachers.

This paper reflects on the relationship violence-prostitution in an oblique reading of the Brazilian and Colombian contexts, from anthropological studies realized in 2006. Considering the dimension and the complexity of such relationship, I intend a concrete approach ethnographically funded in two fields with different depth levels: the relationship of the state to the idea-thing prostitution. The hypothesis is that, for the state - for both these states - it seems interesting to produce a type of prostitution in close relation, either virtual or effective, to the different forms of violence, thus generating prostitution as an inverted looking glass of "democracy" and "modernity". So produced a prostitution is closely linked to the social management of people, bodies, gender relations, sexuality experiences, notions of family, specific forms of labor. I take as point of view the prostitution zone of Puerto Berrios, Colombia, in 2007, and the narratives of historic prostitutes and human rights militants in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2006 and 2009. Additionally, I open my view to look at the "political field of prostitution" in the national and global order. In the two way game I try to evidence connections, transformations and differences taking into account national policies as well as territories and distinct forms of prostitution.

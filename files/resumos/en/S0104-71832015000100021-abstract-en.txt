AbstractThis proposal is a brief of the main issues developed in my ethnography about the universe of experiences lived by Brazilian women in Lisbon&#8217;s Gentlemen&#8217;s clubs &#8211; night clubs where women work to entertain the clients and to make them company. The first part of this paper contextualizes the subject into the field of the migrations movements from Brazil to Portugal. It attempts to demonstrate that the articulation between gender, race, class and sexuality is central in the socially positioning these migrants into the destination context and also constitute what defines this group as diaspora. The second part describes a short episode of my field research to illustrate how the culture of care and the notions of reciprocity, solidarity and responsibility not only represent a source of social status and power, but also shape the construction of the diasporic identities in this context creating spaces of action and agency.

Rodrigues signed his heteronym's name - Suzana Flag- on the autobiographical melodrama Minha Vida [My Life]. The masked authorship and the transvestite enunciation of this text naturalize the ideological effects of the love story, but also poses -perhaps unintentionally- a critical view of the related process of producing a feminine subjectivity and a parody of the resulting ideal of Woman. The analysis of the contradictory characteristics of this text reveals the limitations of the category of "women's literature" and suggests the pertinence of replacing it with that of "writing like (or as) a woman".

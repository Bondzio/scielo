This article recognizes a new location of so called peripheral cultures in world history, and subscribes to a non-monolithic and non-substantialistic concept of culture. It locates Europe's specificity in world history and proposes a symmetrical intercultural dialogue between critics from "peripheral" cultures. These cultures have been colonized, excluded, despised, denied and ignored by eurocentered modernity, but have not been eliminated. The challenge ahead is to establish a transmodern and symmetrical dialogue between these cultures - treated as exteriorities of modernity - in order to deal the challenges set forth by European modernity and postmodernity from a different location.

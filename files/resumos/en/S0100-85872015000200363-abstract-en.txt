Abstract This article intends to analyze the Islamic religiosity in the Brazilian minority context, through the study of the practice of the hijab in the country. The article opens with a brief historical presentation of the Muslim presence in Brazil, covering the traffic of Muslim slaves, Arab immigration and conversion to Islam. Then, Muslim women reports are presented to allow us to better comprehend how they feel they are perceived by non-Muslim Brazilians when wearing the veil. Finally, practices of the hijab by Muslims resident in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Florianópolis and Brasília are analyzed in order to understand how Muslims negotiate and adapt their beliefs and practices in the national context.

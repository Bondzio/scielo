Abstract The purpose of this text is to problematize the issue of migration and its importance as a subject of sociology, in view of the recent intensification of migration flows on a global scale, what is not accompanied by appropriate migration policies and governance. This leads to a dramatic and complex social framework whose understanding constitutes a major challenge for the social sciences and for sociology in particular. Seeking to bring elements that contribute to the understanding of the question and to stimulate its discussion, the text introduces a set of works that comprise the dossier Sociology of migrations: between the understanding of the past the the challenges of the present, offering insights on different dimensions of this issue: in terms of scope (international or focused in Brazil), in terms of the past and the present, in terms of macro and micro approaches.

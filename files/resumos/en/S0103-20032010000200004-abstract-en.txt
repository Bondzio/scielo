This paper examines the French agricultural modernization process based on the evaluation of economists, social and political scientists, involving especially the debate of the contemporary social science and rural economics. The objective is to understand its dynamics by the relationship between different areas of knowledge, aiming at setting up an interpretative model to analyse the specific Brazilian agricultural modernization process. The rural area has not been transformed uniquely on economic grounds, by adopting innovations and new market approaches, but there was also a set up of new political and social identities on rural areas.

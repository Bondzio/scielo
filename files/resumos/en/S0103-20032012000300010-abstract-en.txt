Agricultural production has major effects on the environment; the environment, in turn, affects farming. Despite the importance of the environment, the form of current production is treated as unsustainable and derogatory. In this sense, we have evaluated the importance of this on agricultural production and human actions to conserve the environment. Data Envelopment Analysis and the quantile regression were used. We have used the 2006 Census of Agriculture as a source of data for the municipalities in Minas Gerais state. Results show the significant importance of human actions to conserve the environment on the agricultural production of municipalities and the variables "Plantio em Nível" (Planting Level) and "Terraços" (Terraces) have a major importance. This result can be attributed to the relief and the concentration of municipalities in regions of rugged terrain.

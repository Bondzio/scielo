One of the projects developed by Antonio Gramsci consists of a broad criticism of the ideas of the philosopher Benedetto Croce. Initially conceived as part of a research on the theory of history and of historiography, this critique gradually moves towards a political history of Italian intellectuals of which Croce would be one of the protagonists. This article reconstructs the course of this research inside the Quaderni del carcere, comparing them with the correspondence that its author maintained with Tatiana Schucht and, through her, with Piero Sraffa. This reconstruction allows us to shed light on Antonio Gramsci&#8217;s own method of investigation, which assumes as a principle the identity between philosophy, history and politics.

Abstract In the 2000s, a religious movement that became known as gay churches emerged in Brazil. These religious alternatives remove homosexuality from the area of sin and situate it as a legitimate and natural form of sexuality. The objective of this article is to discuss interconnections between religion and gender transitions based on an analysis of worship. I explore the way in which the feminine is highlighted as a creative power, as worship is a religious activity allowing for plural expressions of identity and gender. I examine the meaning of this experience for its subjects and the way in which subjectivities, politics and gender are interwoven within this context.

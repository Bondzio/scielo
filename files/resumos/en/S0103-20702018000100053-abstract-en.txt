Abstract The present paper analyses Brazilian unionism action, with focus on the main union centre in Brazil, the CUT (Unified Workers&#8217; Central), during Lula&#8217;s and Dilma&#8217;s governments. Our argumentation is that a significant part of the unionism, and the CUT in particular, upon new conditions lived in Brazil in that moment, was unable to join its institutional acting with an increase of labour organization in the working places.

Studies on North-South and South-South development cooperation have demonstrated that there are distinct types of historical experiences, with multiple domestic actors being involved and thematic agendas being reinforced based on different political motivations, as well as various institutional designs conceived by national governments in order to implement their international development cooperation (IDC) strategies. This paper focuses on Brazil&#8217;s strategies as a provider of IDC in the field of education (IDC/ED), analysing its general trends, institutional design, agendas and actors, but also presenting an overview of Brazilian IDC/ED in Portuguese-Speaking African Countries (PALOPS), with a case-study on Mozambique, and taking into account the perceptions of beneficiaries.

Abstract How are international circulation flows produced and consolidated in Latin America? As a wide-ranging literature has shown, the international mobility of people is not produced spontaneously, but rather results from a complex social dynamic. This article reconstructs and analyses the processes by which a number of Argentine students were directed to the Postgraduate Program in Social Anthropology of the National Museum (PPGAS-MN), in Rio de Janeiro. Based on the documentary archive of the PPGAS-MN, as well as on interviews with teachers and former students, this study reveals the institutional mechanisms devised by researchers from both countries in order to enable this flow. It is argued that these dynamics were made possible by the asymmetry between the autonomy and financing of the discipline in each country, and at the same time by the homologous positions in which the Brazilian and Argentine researchers found themselves: the former by the advance of the postgraduate degree courses, and the latter by the existence of a graduate degree in Anthropology, which was unavailable in Brazil.

This article discusses the issue of the depatriarchalization of the Brazilian State, especially from the perspective of the participation/representation dynamics in the executive and legislative branches. This is an on-going process in Brazil (and in other Latin American countries). This article contributes to the debate on the agenda of decolonizing our societies and even the State. The perspective adopted is one where gender is not treated marginally, but as a strategic element for the decolonization/ depatriarchalization of the State, which is one of the central points of analysis regarding the origins of patriarchal oppression. In order to arrive at this point, a long period of critical readings of feminist theory and Brazilian social thought was necessary, given that these reflections discussed the structures, values and theoretical foundations of a social and political system that we claim to still be rooted in patriarchy and neocolonialism in our country. We will observe how this context is permeated by various contradictions: patriarchy has equally transformed itself and unfortunately continues to shape our state institutions, guaranteeing and sustaining the subordinate placement of women in distinct dimensions of the public sphere. Hence, this has greatly slowed down the progress women's movements have demanded and continue to fight for. Nevertheless, there are already some initiatives underway related mechanisms that can make up accountable systems that are institutionally gender-sensitive and be receptive to continuing processes of women's empowerment as a democratizing strategy of the Brazilian state in the legislative, executive and judiciary branches.

The article discusses the intersections between media, gender and elections, presenting an analysis of the coverage in the Jornal Nacional, the evening news of the main Brazilian Television Network, Rede Globo, and propaganda produced by candidates during the 2010 Brazilian presidential elections. It is not a general analysis of TV news and propaganda, but a study focused on gender bias in an election that had two women running for President, both with real chances of winning. The analysis shows how gender is part of the image of the main candidates, both in journalism and in their own campaign strategies. We point out differences and complementarities in gender stereotypes in these two different discourses.

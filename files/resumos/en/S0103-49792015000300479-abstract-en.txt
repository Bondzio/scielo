This article analyzes contemporary Brazilian unionism and, at the same time, discusses the process of affiliation to unions in the country from a few union indicators. Data from this study, mainly based on the National Research by Home Samples (PNAD) of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), show a movement from the unions, regarding all Brazilian regions, gender issues, and the city/countryside relationship. This process is more apparent inside the main union center in Brazil, the CUT (Workers Union Center).

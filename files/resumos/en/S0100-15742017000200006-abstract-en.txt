ABSTRACT Problems inherited from the last decades have led Timor-Leste to restructure its pre-secondary - EPS - and general secondary - ESG - curricula. Considering the importance of an adequate vertical articulation throughout the schooling cycles and before the conclusion of the first complete edition of the EPS, it is necessary to study if such a curriculum is aligned with the one of the ESG, in particular with regard to Science and Technology. This article focuses on the analysis of the EPS curriculum and the evaluation of its articulation with the one of ESG. Notwithstanding the d√©calages among the prescribed, the implemented and the appropriate curricula, it is relevant to have a fine-tuning at this level to ensure good quality education and training, essential to achieve the millennium development goals.

This article presents a critical analysis of seven theses about the Brazilian rural area. In the beginning we explain these entire theses, and after then we wrote a very critical analysis that point out some inconsistent and contradictions that we saw in these theses. Finally, we present some general considerations highlighting the importance of this debate, but with the comprehension that this debate should be done according to the rural complexity situation, and without any exclusion of social segments that live in the rural area.

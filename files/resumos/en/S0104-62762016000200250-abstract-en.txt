Abstract This article evaluates the effectiveness of participatory institutions in Brazil by empirically analyzing the municipal councils of social assistance. We process our evaluation via the Effectiveness Participation Index (IEP), which consists of three indicators: a) the degree of institutionalization of the councils; b) the quality of the deliberative processes; and c) the quality of representation. The IEP was constructed using official data on the functioning of the Policy Councils in 2012 (Census Suas Minist√©rio do Desenvolvimento Social) for all municipalities in Brazil. We conclude that there are significant degrees of effectiveness of the participatory institutions in the country due to, on the one hand, the three constituent dimensions of participation&#8212;institutionalization, deliberation, and representation&#8212;and, on the other, regional and demographic differences between Brazilian municipalities.

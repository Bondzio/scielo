Abstract The legal sociology and that of domination elaborated by Max Weber represent a paradigmatic shift in the field of political theory. By moving the analysis of the means of acquisition and institution of power of dominants to the belief of the dominated, they operate a remarkable inversion in the way of understanding the political power legitimacy. Exposure of the tension between the bureaucratic expansion and the structure of democratic domination has given the Weberian reflection a prophetic tone that is still felt. The purpose of this paper is to examine some of Weber's concepts in order to analyze the relation between bureaucratic domination and legitimacy of political power. In conclusion, a brief analysis is carried out to raise some questions on the legitimacy of the Judiciary in the Brazilian democracy.

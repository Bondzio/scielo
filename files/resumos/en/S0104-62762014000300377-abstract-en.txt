The concept of framing is intensively used in media studies. However, it is usually employed in a fractured way. In despite of its semantics inaccuracy, also contributes to these problems the lack of formal routines to identify media-frames. This article proposes a routine to framing identification based on the combination between Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (Caqdas) and Correspondence Analysis techniques. Such mixed method could clarify the formalization of media-frames without mechanizing the full process. To exemplify the usefulness of this technique, it's applied to a corpusof journalistic texts about the affirmative action in Brazil.

Abstract This article considers the childhood scene in Mário de Andrade's work, focusing on two main levels or spheres of actualization: on the one hand, his politico-cultural interventions and, on the other, his literary production. For both levels, it examines a "politics of aesthetics" in Mário de Andrade: a combination of social and racial preoccupations and aesthetic reflections around childhood. Through its multiple aesthetical and political levels, childhood in Mário de Andrade's work reveals that which has been excluded, reconfiguring ways of perceiving social life and pointing towards the transformation of the hierarchies of representation.

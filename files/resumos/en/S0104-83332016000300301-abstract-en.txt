Abstract This paper analyses the presence of women in scientific expeditions in Brazil in the mid-twentieth century and the several ways gender implications influenced these experiences. The research was conducted primarily through the documents of the Brazilian Inspection Council on Artistic and Scientific Expeditions, the federal organization responsible for inspecting and licensing expeditions into the country between the years of 1933 and 1968. The purpose of this article is to present this study, to reflect about women participation in scientific practices and reveal women scientists&#8217; experiences in Brazil at that time.

Abstract: This article presents the results and analyses of a study conducted with boys and girls in the 8th and 9th grades in one of the metropolitan regions around SÃ£o Paulo state, Brazil. We identified their perceptions about their experiences doing physical activities and sports, the frequency that they practice those activities in/outside of school, their interest in relation to those activities, and finally their perspectives practicing those activities for pleasure, their physical competency, and social support. The investigation involved providing a survey with closed-ended questions to the students, and the final sample included 1,742 subjects from 39 schools. Gender proved to be a statistically significant marker in the results: inequalities in gender were favorable to boys in almost all the aspects evaluated, except regarding educator support, which was perceived to be equal.

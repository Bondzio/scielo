The author explains her experiences on the electronic publication field, and in very important printed publications such as the emblematic Fempress. She approaches the use of the Technologies of information and communication (TIC), that have allowed to share information and contributed to the invigoration and monitoring of actions that propitiate the rendering of information and strengthening of women's nets. By using the TICs, women have promoted alliances and articulations, favoring the structuring and construction of proposals, consents and more equal and democratic relationships in the feminist and women movement. The author describes that through the eletronic publications it is generated and exchanged information about the problems that women live; their efforts and advances are exposed, the solidarity is developed, and a great variety of themes is approached. The nets of women grow and get strengthen, and the information generated by them, grows in an exponential way. But these nets are also integrated by poor women, peasants, indigenous, illiterate, women who speak other languages or with discapacity, who cannot access the TICs, so it is necessary to look for the ways of reverting this situation.

Abstract: This article reviews socioeconomic literature that explains how economic practices condemned at certain times were ressignified and gained social legitimacy. It traces a history from the figure of the greedy speculator to the current image of the &#8220;rational&#8221; investor, who strengthens current financial education projects. Finally, the paper also provides subsidies to elucidate the rise of popular investors and the expansion of financial education programs in Brazil, which is constituted as a social arrangement shared by agents and producers of the country&#8217;s financial world.

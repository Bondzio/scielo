Abstract The article deals with the political, economic, domestic and international dimensions of the international crisis initiated in 2007-2008. It intends to grasp its impasses and peculiarities, to understand its gravity and resilience and explore paths to the future. In order to do that, explores three key conundrums: the governance, the growth and the fiscal conundrums. Then, it deals with four alternative paths which may be followed by the international order. In only one there is significant concern to strengthen the institutional capacity to deal with the impasses. As a consequence, the world order may disintegrate and degenerate in fragmentation and deadlock. The avoidance of this scenario requires governance structures which strengthen cooperation and a growth model able to revert the threatens to the environment.

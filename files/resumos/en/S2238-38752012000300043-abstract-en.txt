Abstract: Despite his prolific work and relevant contributions to the Social Sciences, particularly to Sociology and History, and the recent revival of the debate about social movements in Brazil, a systematic dialogue with the author Charles Tilly is still incipient in the country. This article offers a critical discussion of Tilly's legacy in the study of collective actions, in general, and of social movements, more specifically, divided into three steps: first, "with Tilly", recuperating his classical theoretical and methodological contributions in this field; second, "against Tilly", discussing the most important criticism of his work, controversies with other theories, schools and authors, as well as Tilly's attempts at seeking new answers to his questions; finally, "beyond Tilly", highlighting central elements of his collective trajectory and seeking to reach beyond his most recent work. In the course of its historical and theoretical analysis, this article engages in a broader discussion about the ongoing reconfiguration of collective actions and social movements as a field of study.

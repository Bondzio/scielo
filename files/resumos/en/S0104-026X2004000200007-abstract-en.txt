This paper presents a reading of the way in which feminism treats the issue of houseswok, especially the relationship between domestic labor and its basis for bourgeois intellectual production. Through an examination of three of Getrude Stein's works - The Authobiography of Alice B. Toklas, Everybody's Biography, and The Gentle Lena - this reading seeks to destabilize the negative values usually attributed to domestic labor.

In this work the author seeks to establish a relationship between Marcel Mauss' theory of The Gift and the theoretical approaches to care, what he does from the perspective of the healthcare. Based on these considerations, he proposes a broadened gift-paradigm so that to allow the theories of care to be reinterpreted according to the vocabulary of the gift. In view of this reflection, he proposes to review hierarchies and the forms of motives that structure healthcare organizations.

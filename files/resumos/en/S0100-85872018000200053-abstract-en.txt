Abstract: The objective of this article is to examine the magnitude of the hypothesis about possible changes in the laicity of state model in Uruguay. For this purpose, this research was dedicated to analyze the legislative debate on abortion, in order to verify the influence of moral and/or religious convictions in the discussion of this public matter. The methodology applied consisted of the analysis of the parliamentary pronouncements of the House of Representatives, pronounced between 1985 and 2016. In the first part, the text focuses on constructing the research problem. In the second part, we present the data collected, specifically the positions and arguments mobilized by the parliamentarians. From the findings, we discuss the confluences and divergences of the results with the hypothesis about modifications in the laicity built in Uruguay.

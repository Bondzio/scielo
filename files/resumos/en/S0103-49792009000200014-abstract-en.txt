The objective of this paper is to recover Norbert Elias' ideas that give clues for the understanding of the mechanisms of social suportability and of the devices of regulation of the sensations that become fundamental in the production processes and of social reproduction, particularly delimited in the context of Latin America. For that, at first, the notions of figurations and process are shown. In a second moment, the main transformations are examined in the subjective world beginning with shame and displeasure. Soon afterwards, the "romanticism" notion is analyzed, to conclude with a series of reflections about Elias' contributions for a sociology of bodies and emotions, that is intended to be in epistemic alert from a post-colonial Latin-American point of view.

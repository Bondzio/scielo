Based on an analysis of the relation between home and work, and the meaning of this relation for care practices, the article develops a critique of Betty Friedan arguments in the book The feminine mystique, taken as an ironic continuation of the Marxist project of reducing the emancipation of women to getting a job outside the home. Assuming an opposition between care and work, love and money, certain feminists have turned their back on domestic work. However the organized movement of household workers, which campaigns for legal recognition of their work, has underlined the interconnection between social reproduction and production. At the same time, theorists have questioned the work ethic based on a productivist paradigm of social life.

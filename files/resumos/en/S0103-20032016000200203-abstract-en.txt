Abstract: The paper analyzes the patterns of cotton production for groups of small farmers in Brazil and its impacts on the stated preferences for new systems of production. Specifically, it identifies the main characteristics that differentiate the choices for genetically modified cotton (Bt and RR) and non-genetically modified cotton (colorful, organic and conventional white). Analyses are based on primary data applied to groups of cotton farmers up to 50 hectares in the main producing regions in Brazil. The patterns of association between the characteristics of the farmers and the production systems were analyzed using Multiple Correspondence Analysis. The probability to adopt new systems of production was analyzed using the Conjoint Analysis. Results highlight that even among small farmers there are important distinctions between the patterns of production that determine the choice for new types of seed. The prior knowledge of the farming system, through the current agricultural practice, proved to be a key factor in the stated preferences for new production systems. The paper concludes that the production chain, especially the role of local cooperatives and private networks to support production and marketing, would play a central role in defining networks of influence and the adoption of production systems.

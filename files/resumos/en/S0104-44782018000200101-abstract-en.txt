ABSTRACT  Introduction The aim of this article is to explore party migration dynamics at local level, between 2000 and 2016, focusing on mayor and city councilor elections in Brazil. There is a lot of studies about party migration at national level, especially about Congress. However, at local level the phenomena does not receive the same attention.  Methods Methodology used is all quantitative, taking information from Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE), and using tools like electoral geography, network analysis and descriptive statistics.  Results Party migration does not bring, necessarily, more electoral success. The article also show that, at local level, migration taxes are decaying.  Discussion In general, literature says that parties have &#8220;weak&#8221; connections with their candidates, in the cities. Parties would be changed all the time by politicians, whenever the context were favorable. From this point of view, party migration at the municipal level would be determined by circumstantial factors. However, the findings obtained in this article reveal that there are patterns of behavior of candidates and parties in municipalities in terms of electoral strategies, and that the variation in migration indicators is not ad hoc. In this way, we point to another reality: parties can follow distinct and coordinated strategies, when it is about switching or not.

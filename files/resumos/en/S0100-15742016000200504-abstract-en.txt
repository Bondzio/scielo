Our goal is to analyze aspects of the course of the game that outlined the final version of the fourth goal of the new Plano Nacional de Educação [Nacional Plan of Education] of Brazil. For this purpose, we used documentary analysis as the methodological procedure. Our analyses were based on the game models of Norbert Elias. Our considerations provide evidence that overcoming a political culture, clearly personalist and mercantilist, is an important and fundamental part of a game in which we take part in the process of elaborating social policies. The involvement of people and groups around issues that defy economic rationality makes the social game tense and contributes to the production of a language in which the promises of the spirit of law are more frequently discussed.

This article presents facts, perceptions and social representations on the daily life of female commercial sex workers (FCSW). We evaluated 8 educational intervention programs on STD/AIDS addressed to FCSW in cities of southern, south-eastern and north-eastern Brazilian regions. In those places, we conducted in-depth interviews and focal groups. Results indicate that the representation of a woman who sells her body is resignified as the performance of erotic fantasies. Possibilities of greater autonomy are hampered by discrimination and psychological tension. Client and police-driven violence were remarkable. Condom use plays a relevant role in sex negotiation but it is neglected when relationships involve affection or as a result of competition. We conclude, from the perspective of autonomy, that FCSW's autonomy is limited by social class, economical crisis and stigma, leading to discrimination, violence and STD/HIV contagion risk.

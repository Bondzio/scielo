This article examines the launching of conditional cash transfer programs    by Brazilian municipalities to explore this problem. The literature of political    science asserts that such programs have been widely implemented because they    correspond to an alternative policy strategy adopted by governments facing opposition    to implement universal public policies. So, political competition would be at    the root of CCT launching. This article presents an alternative explanation.    From 1995 to 2001, local governments created or emulated the Bolsa Escola Program    (BEP) in all regions of the country. Sucha a path continued after the lauching    of the national Bolsa Escola by the federal government. Why did some local governments    decide to adopt the national BEP and others did not? To answer these questions,    the research tests the influence of structural, internal and external variables    on the dissemination of CCT programs. Two main hypotheses are tested. The first    asserts that local political competition is positive for policy diffusion. The    second hypothesis claims that party alignment between the municipal and federal    levels increases the likelihood of municipalities adopting the federal BEP.    The research uses Event History Analysis to test statistically the impact of    political incentives on policy diffusion among S&atilde;o Paulo State's municipalities.    Two types of policy diffusion are examined: horizontal and vertical. The findings    confirm that political competition influences the horizontal diffusion among    municipalities. Unexpectedly, vertical diffusion does not occur because of party    alignment or political competition. Rather, levels of socioeconomic development    drive policy emulation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Keywords:</b> policy diffusion; political    competition; local government; conditional cash transfer programs</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The launching of innovations in social policies    by municipalities in Brazil was largely expected as a result of the emergence    of new political parties and the flourishing of participative bodies at the    local level. What is surprising is the fact that local social programs spread    broadly in the country during a specific period when many social policies were    also being offered by states and the central government. Experiences such as    the Participatory Budgeting, <i>Family</i> Health Program and Conditional Cash    Transfers<a name="tx1" href="#nt1"><sup>1</sup></a> are good examples of local    innovation that spread out among municipalities. Understanding the origin and    diffusion of innovative public policies are the goals of this article. More    specifically, the object of this study is the Bolsa Escola Program, implemented    for the first time in 1995 in Campinas (SP) and Bras&iacute;lia (DF). The main    goals of the program were to fight poverty and, simultaneously, to broaden the    coverage of education<a name="tx2" href="#nt2"><sup>2</sup></a> by transferring    cash directely to participant families. The path of Bolsa Escola expansion among    Brazilian municipalities began in 1995 and lasted until 2001. In this period,    the federal government also created two national programs: the <i>Minimum Income    Guarantee Program (Programa de Garantia de Renda M&iacute;nima - PGRM)</i> in    1997, and the Bolsa Escola Federal<a name="tx3" href="#nt3"><sup>3</sup></a>    in 2001. The former was implemented in 1,350 municipalities and the latter was    present in almost all cities in the country from its first year.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The main difference between the municipal programs    and the two versions of its federal counterpart relates to their respective    funding arrangements. In the case of municipal Bolsa Escola, the local government    was in charge of funding. In the first period of the federal programs, cash    transfers made to beneficiaries came from a joint federal and municipal fund,    while in the second period it was funded exclusively by the federal government.    After the implementation of these federal programs, it was expected that local    governments would no longer be responsible for local policies of cash transfers.    Nonetheless, hundreds of municipalities from the five geographic regions of    Brazil followed the experience undertaken in Campinas and Bras&iacute;lia.<a name="tx4" href="#nt4"><sup>4</sup></a>    Deeply diverse in terms of population, poverty levels, economic weight and political    system, many municipalities decided to fund the same program, an event that    occurred in a relatively short period of time. The expansion of an identical    policy model among municipalities is intriguing and raises important questions    for public policy research agenda. The present study of minimum income diffusion    in Brazil is relevant to identify the directional mechanisms for policy adoption    such as emulation across municipalities and emulation as a top-down process.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To explain the phenomena of the diffusion of    innovations that originate from domestic processes and experience multiple directions,    the present article examines the case of the state of S&atilde;o Paulo, a jurisdiction    where approximately two hundred municipalities administered by different political    parties adopted the programs of Bolsa Escola at the municipal level and/or the    PGRM between 1995 and 2001.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In theoretical terms, the approach adopted in    this study is rooted in the policy diffusion and political competition literature,    with special emphasis on the incentives actors are exposed to when creating    and reproducing innovative ideas. This theoretical approach differs greatly    from those traditionally used in the domestic literature. In Brazil, the process    of implementing public policies is studied largely from the perspective of federalism,    with emphasis on intergovernmental relations and the positive and negative features    of decentralization (Draibe 1998a, 1998b, 2004; Arretche 2000, 2004; Abrucio    2002, 2005; Souza 1997, 1998; Melo 1996; Samuels 2004). Despite the essential    contributions to the understanding of a set of specific questions provided by    this body of literature, an analysis of the policy diffusion process in developing    countries like Brazil is non-existent. In a review of public policy research,    Faria (2003) confirmed the lack of analyses focused on policy diffusion in Brazil.    Accordingly, the traditional approaches of the specialized literature appear    limited. When focusing on the role of the central government and its institutional    capacity to implement public policies, scholars tend to minimize factors such    as local political competition, economic development, and the regional effects    of geographic proximity, which are very important to explain the origin and    path of public policies. The theoretical and empirical approaches of social    policy diffusion involving cash transfers have not been yet incorporated into    these analyses. Only a few exceptions to this rule are evident, as the study    by Sugiyama (2007) on the diffusion of the programs Bolsa Escola and Sa&uacute;de    da Fam&iacute;lia ("Family Heath Program"), some theoretical and empirical contributions    by Melo (2004, 2007) concerning the diffusion of pro-poor programs in Brazil,    and by Wampler (2005) about the diffusion of participatory budgeting.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Theoretical Approaches and Policy Diffusion</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The classical problem in the study of patterns    of ideas and policy diffusion is to understand who adopts an innovation, how    this occurs and what is the pace of this phenomenon.<a name="tx5" href="#nt5"><sup>5</sup></a>    In addition to these main questions, others emerge in different fields of study.    In the context of the diffusion of cash transfer programs in Brazil, the following    questions are crucial: why did municipal governors emulate policies from other    municipalities? Why some mayors did not adhere to federal policies and created    new social programs? Why did certain emulated policies spread quickly and others    not? These are key questions that the literature on social policy diffusion,    well recognized by national and international comparative studies, should investigate    to better understand the puzzle of local policy-making process. The current    body of work has been based on three rival theoretical notions to identify the    factors that engender policy diffusion: <i>political incentives</i>, <i>ideology</i>,    and <i>social network</i>. The approach that considers <i>political incentives</i>    to be the most relevant is based on rational choice theories.<a name="tx6" href="#nt6"><sup>6</sup></a>    According to this approach, individuals make rational choices seeking directly    their political survival. The strategy adopted aims at minimizing costs and    maximizing their own benefits, taking into account the selection of policies    among all other existing alternatives. The seminal study by Downs (1999) explains    the strategic behavior of political actors in competitive electoral environments.    The author considers that individuals' rational behavior essentially meets their    own interests.<a name="tx7" href="#nt7"><sup>7</sup></a> In the context of policy    diffusion, the specialized literature indicates that individuals create or emulate    programs in order to obtain political credit from the electorate. According    to Palloni (2001:71), "the vast majority of the applications of diffusion models    in the field of demographic and sociological studies neglects a basic principle:    adopters and non-adopters are rational decision makers and the adoption is the    result of a rational decision making process". The work of Keefer and Khemani    (2003a, 2003b), analyzing the competition for innovative policies, demonstrates    that the stronger the electoral competition between parties is, the more likely    the parties will attempt to propose new social programs. In this scenario, the    parties' goal would be to distinguish themselves from others, seeking to be    identified as reformers. Therefore, municipalities, states or countries with    high levels of electoral alternation tend to create or adopt new policies. From    this perspective, it is expected that BEP and PGRM will be emulated more often    in cities with highly competitive mayoral election races. In short, the hypothesis    is that the increased provision of welfare to vulnerable groups of the population    increases the chances of political reelection.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">According to the theoretical approach focusing    on the question of <i>ideology</i>, political actors would be more interested    in making decisions based on their trust in social change, with no concern about    particular gains. Mullins (1972) considers that the ideological division between    right and left does matter, and guides the evaluation of the implementation    of certain social policies. From this point of view, left-wing politicians are    guided by personal and moral values, being able to make decisions against their    own interests. Analyzing the policy diffusion dynamics in America, Boushey (2010)    suggests that more liberal progressive states will be more receptive to policy    innovation, and conservative traditionalist states will remain entrenched and    resistant to policy change. From this theoretical perspective, since the BEP    and the PGRM represent an institutional innovation both in terms of policies    to combat poverty and in terms of extending social rights, it is likely that    political actors from left and center-left parties will become more active in    emulating these programs, in connection with their ideological beliefs. In recent    elections, parties located on this side of the ideological spectrum vindicated    that the State must reconfigure the welfare network through minimum-income programs.    As the literature points out, the ideological positioning of Brazilian parties    does not present strong variations over time. Using the categories of Mainwaring    (1999), and Power &amp; Zucco (2009) which converge by positing PT and PSDB    as left and center-left parties, the present work tests the role of the main    parties that compete for the paternity of the minimum-income model in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For <i>social network</i> theory, actors and    institutions under similar social structures tend to adopt the same professional    rules and to reproduce their partner's acts. For Abrahamson (1991, 1996), adopting    policies is related to the existence of trends among the members of a certain    social network. By studying the regional effects of the diffusion of state policies,    Mooney (2001) reaffirmed the findings of Walker (1969) and validated the importance    of informal networks, understood as arrangements that bring political and social    actors closer, geographically speaking. In the studies of diffusion, this type    of analysis is denominated as "spatial proximity". A classical consensus of    researches on diffusion is that the spatial proximity among actors can result    in a stronger political influence in connection to personal or cultural links.    Even though Brazil and S&atilde;o Paulo state have an institutionalized network    of public policies, there are no empirical evidences sustaining that a political    or a non-governmental organization have provided support to the dissemination    of the Bolsa Escola Program. Following such a perspective, and based on a spatial    diffusion-model, this study tests the influence of informal mechanisms such    as facilitated communication and the frequency of interactions among political    actors that are geographically close to each other.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The study conducted by Sugiyama (2007) was the    first to critically discuss the three rival theoretical approaches in order    to identify the factors that engender policy diffusion. The study on the diffusion    of Bolsa Escola and Programa de Sa&uacute;de da Fam&iacute;lia ("Family Health    Program") in Brazil produced interesting results. The main goal of the research    was to investigate the factors that caused the recent diffusion of policy innovation    among Brazil's geographic regions. To accomplish this, the three rival theoretical    models were tested in order to identify the individual motivation that led political    actors to emulate the programs. The latter two approaches, ideology and social    network, are connected to sociological theories. They consider the actors' ideology<a name="tx8" href="#nt8"><sup>8</sup></a>    and their participation in networks as factors that are likely to stimulate    the reproduction of programs. The results of the statistical model and the qualitative    analysis demonstrated that the variable "political competition" did not explain    the diffusion. The study concluded that the actors' participation in networks,    as well as their ideological position, are factors that influence the dissemination    of innovative programs. However, from the conceptual and methodological point    of view, the study failed when it dealt with both BEP and PGRM as the only phenomenon    that needed to be explained. The justification was based on the comparability    of two dimensions: institutional design and programmatic objectives.<a name="tx9" href="#nt9"><sup>9</sup></a>    Such a conceptual interpretation leads to a methodological mistake as the effect    estimation of the covariables on the dependent variable is biased. It is not    possible to estimate precisely, in the same statistical model, the effect of    political competition on the creation of local programs and adherence to federal    ones, as actors' political incentives differ and are directly connected to financial    and political costs. In sum, the study provided a relevant contribution to the    literature on policy diffusion, and opened a new research field in Brazil.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To conclude, these theoretical approaches differ    from each other both in conceptual terms and in the definition of the factors    that motivate politicians to emulate policies. However, although this divergence    is valuable for theoretical analysis, a common factor should be considered in    the study of policy diffusion: the costs of reproducing a program from another    jurisdiction. These costs, for instance, the enforcement of law and administrative    procedures, personnel training, and program functioning, result in political    unease for political actors and cannot be disregarded in comparative and case    studies. Therefore, the present study takes the rational calculus of actions'    costs <i>versus</i> benefits that can be obtained as the central variable to    be tested in order to investigate the reasons that lead a political actor to    emulate social sector innovation. From this perspective, the ideological formation    of an actor, or the social network in which they belong are important but do    not matter as much as political incentives to explain the implementation of    a social policy. Based on this theoretical understanding, this study encompasses    an analysis based on an empirical investigation of the <i>political incentives</i>    that motivate politicians to emulate cash transfers policies. In this article,    <i>political incentives</i> are considered in two different dimensions due to    the features of the programs analyzed, as well as their specific diffusion patterns.    In the case of horizontal diffusion among municipalities, <i>political incentives</i>    are analyzed according to the level of <i>electoral competition</i>. The more    intense the local competition, the stronger a mayor's incentive to create policies    that will increase their reelection chances. For vertical diffusion between    central and municipal levels of government, the <i>political incentives</i>    are analyzed based on the competition for federal budget resources, so mayors    politically aligned to the president's party will have more incentives to adopt    national policies, regardless of existing adherence rules.<a name="tx10" href="#nt10"><sup>10</sup></a></font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Methodology</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The focus of this article rests in a case study    of S&atilde;o Paulo.<a name="tx11" href="#nt11"><sup>11</sup></a> The study    employs the Event History Analysis (EHA) methodology. EHA is used by many authors    interested in understanding the conditions that determine the continuity of    a certain phenomenon over time. Researches that make use of EHA can work with    either quantitative or qualitative data, or even with the two combined. In order    to have a reasonable explanation of the factors that led mayors to create BEP    and to adhere to PGRM, this study employs a mix of approaches. The analysis    of the determinants of these motivations required, in addition to qualitative    research, the use of probability-statistical models. These were models of survival    or risk analysis and the <i>logit</i> model. In the international literature,    survival models can appear under different names: <i>survival analysis, duration    models, survival models, reliability models </i>and<i> failure-time models </i>(Box-Steffensmeier    and Jones 2004a)<i>. </i>The application of statistical models in EHA methodologies    is used in order to estimate the probability that a specific event will occur    over time. Traditionally, EHA was applied to case studies with small unities    of analysis (<i>small-N</i>). More recently, studies with <i>large N</i> started    to be covered by the literature. King <i>et al</i>. (1994) affirm that analyzing    a larger number of cases allows one to establish a consistent causal inference    between variables. Box-Steffensmeier and Jones (1997, 2004b) corroborate this    by affirming that the employment of statistical analysis across a large number    of cases can generate improved confidence in the results. Berry and Berry (1990,    1992, 1999), and Collier and Messick (1975) emphasize that the model allows    a more robust analysis of the internal and external aspects of diffusion, which    in turn makes the entire research project more consistent.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The EHA model allows testing both the internal    and regional effects by using time-series cross-sectional data. The main advantage    of using EHA to study the diffusion of policies is that the model captures the    temporal characteristics of changes by using data such as the time, the quantity    of cases, the sequence and the duration of events (Box-Steffensmeier and Jones    1997). Researches that use EHA have a focus, therefore, on the processes of    change over a course of time with temporal longitudinal data, with a strong    emphasis on the dynamic of temporal structure in clear substitution to researches    focused on traditional cross-sectional methods. Compared to other models, the    methodological advantage of EHA is that the method allows to estimate more precisely    the influence of factors that determine the political change over time. A crucial    difference is that EHA identifies the timing of the political change by demarcating    the periods in which the events took place. Thus, the model properly controls    the study of dynamic processes through a technique that is also dynamic. As    its theoretical-methodological proposal, the article presents how EHA can be    used to investigate recent diffusion-phenomena in Brazil based on a design of    empirical research that incorporates both the internal and regional determinants    influencing the diffusion of BEP. In sum, the application of EHA makes it possible    to measure the effect of internal (political competition, ideology, economic    development, etc.) and external (social or political networks by means of geographical    proximity) variables.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>The Diffusion of the Municipal Bolsa Escola    Program</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The emergence and the emulation of social programs    led by local governments is a rare event in the Brazilian political system.    One of the aims of this study is to describe how the bandwagon-effect of Bolsa    Escola Program took place in S&atilde;o Paulo, based on diffusion theories.    The literature does not stipulate a minimum number of cases for categorizing    a diffusion-phenomenon. Instead, it establishes a few points of consensus, such    as: a similar adoption of aims, instruments and implementation styles. Another    characteristic is that the emulation of the program is expected to take place    in a relatively short period of time. Based on the specialized literature, this    study identifies sufficient properties for classifying the emulation of BEP    in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo as a phenomenon of policy diffusion. The S&atilde;o    Paulo municipalities have replicated similar institutional designs for a period    of seven years in an environment characterized by the absence of coordination    of political institutions and pressure by non-governmental organizations. The    decision of emulating BEP was interconnected with previous decisions of other    governments, marked by informal interaction among the pioneers and the copiers.    From this perspective, as defined by Elkins &amp; Simmons (2005), the diffusion    process has taken place in an uncoordinated but interconnected way.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In other regions of the country, the launching    of the program was also an independent decision of each jurisdiction. The adoption    of similar objectives in the cases of Campinas and Bras&iacute;lia and peer-learning    - political parties with analagous programs and contents - indicate that there    was indeed an interconnection among the cases. In all regions of the country,    the model was also emulated by municipalities administered by different political    parties. These municipalities vary significantly in terms of population size    and in economic and social indicators, so it is intriguing that the objectives    and the style of implementation of the policy were quite similar. The following    data illustrate the dynamism and the specificity of the Brazilian case.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03tab1.jpg">Table 1</a> shows the distribution of municipal proposals    for the creation of Bolsa Escola by political parties across Brazil. The survey    shows that 61 per cent of the 90 proposals had a PT authorship while PSDB originated    approximately 13 per cent of the proposals. The result shows that PT had a leading    role in initiating proposals, along with its attempt to dominate politics.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03tab2.jpg">Table 2</a> shows the distribution of municipal proposals    for Bolsa Escola. The state of S&atilde;o Paulo has 53 of the 90 proposals (59    per cent of the total). These data indicate that concerning the proposal of    innovative policies, the state of S&atilde;o Paulo is quite distinct from the    rest of the country. Moreover, the table indicates that the number of S&atilde;o    Paulo proposals is partly associated with the number of proposals presented    by PT.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The number of programs effectively implemented    by municipalities between 1995 and 2001 shows that the state of S&atilde;o Paulo    leads with more than half (51 per cent) of the programs. In terms of region,    80 per cent of the cases are concentrated in the south and southeast, and the    other regions comprise 20 per cent. This result reinforces the findings that    S&atilde;o Paulo stand out from other states. Two factors play a role in explaining    the strength of S&atilde;o Paulo in fostering Bolsa Escola Program: first, the    fact that PT governed a larger number of city halls in this state, compared    to the rest of the country; second, the importance of Campinas as a pole city    that influenced the neighboring cities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03fig1.jpg">Figures    1</a> and <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03fig2.jpg">2</a> graphically illustrate    the development of BEP's diffusion in the state of S&atilde;o Paulo. In <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03fig1.jpg">Figure    1</a>, it is possible to notice that the pattern of diffusion is not stable    over the years, oscillating up and down , including years of no program creation    (1998, 2000). Authors like Lowi (1963) and Walker (1969, 1973) argue that the    first years of a program are more likely to witness the creation of new programs,    either because the motivations to innovate are stronger or because political    campaign promises begin to be carried out. In the specific case of BEP, the    years of 1997 and 2001 witnessed the approval of, respectively, six and two    programs. Considering that in the first year, five municipalities created the    program and in 1996 ten extra municipalities did the same, it would be expected    that in 1997 this number would increase. In 2001, when PGRM had already been    in execution since 1999 and BEP since April, it would be reasonable to expect    municipalities to adopt the federal program. Moreover, the fact that 1996 was    the year in which the largest number of municipalities copied the program and,    at the same time, in 2000 there were no new cases registered, suggest that these    last years did not provide sufficient incentives for the creation of new policies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03fig2.jpg">Figure    2</a>, it can be observed the cumulative evolution of BEP over the last three    cycles of municipal government. In the first period, the first 15 cases appear.    In the second, 12 extra cases are registered and in the last one, two other    cases are observed. The cumulative adoption over time is often interpreted in    the literature as an S-shaped curve that follows a frequency distribution showing    a slow pace at the first stage, followed by faster growth and then a decrease    at the last moment (Rogers 1995; Stocking 1985; Mohr 1987). The cumulative distribution,    which demonstrates BEP's path between 1995 and 2001, can be interpreted in two    ways. In the first case, the adoption rates reflect one of the types of S-shaped    distribution. In the second case, the emulation of the programs is similar to    the classic form of S-shaped distribution. The results of the distribution,    shown in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03fig1.jpg">figures 1</a> and <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03fig2.jpg">2</a>,    define two important dimensions of the diffusion process: the path of the program    and the rate of the program adoption over time as well as the profile of actors    who tend to copy innovative policies.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>The Diffusion in S&atilde;o Paulo: an Event    History Analysis</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This section analyzes the influence of internal    and structural determinants on the probability that S&atilde;o Paulo's municipalities    copy BEP. In order to estimate, the statistical methodology of EHA, which assess    the risk that a specific event will occur in a given period, is used. In the    particular context of BEP's diffusion, the model of Survival Analysis is applied    with the purpose of measuring the probability that a given municipality would    take the initiative of adopting a program from another municipality from 1995    to 2002. Survival models differ from other kind of regressions due to two characteristics.    The first is that this kind of model deals with censored data, which is only    partially observed due to the end of the research, lack of information and/or    random failure. The second difference is that the independent variable can have    its value changed during the observation period, which makes the analysis more    reliable. The Survival Analysis applied in this study is the Proportional Hazard    model by Cox. The model relates the dependent variable to covariables (hazard    factors) that are likely to be associated with the failure or occurrence of    an event.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Description of Cox's Proportional Hazard Model,    Variables and Hypotheses</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The data organization for the analysis of BEP    was undertaken with the support of the statistical package STATA.<a name="tx12" href="#nt12"><sup>12</sup></a>    The statistical model of Survival Analysis will be used in order to allow for    the probabilistic interpretation of the risk of municipalities to create BEP.

Cox's proportional hazard model attributes a hazard function    h<b><sub>0</sub></b> (t) to all individuals.

The dependent variable is coded dichotomically, with "0" attributed    to municipalities that did not create a BEP and "1" to those that have. When    an event occurs, that is, when a municipality creates a BEP, the year of creation    is registered and the municipality is not reported for the subsequent years.<a name="tx15" href="#nt15"><sup>15</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Independent Variables</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The statistical model used in this study will    test the effect of a set of independent variables that are associated with internal    and structural factors of the phenomenon analyzed.

The literature identifies political competition    as a robust determinant of policy diffusion. One of the findings of Walker's    seminal work (1969) on policy diffusion among American states in the 1960s was    that competitive electoral systems are more likely to emulate a policy in comparison    to less competitive or noncompetitive electoral systems. Following this argument,    the municipalities that have greater electoral competition are expected to be    more likely to emulate Bolsa Escola than those municipalities with less competition.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 1</u>: <i>In political systems,    at the municipal level, the larger the electoral competition, the higher the    probability of creating Bolsa Escola</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Municipalities governed by PT (MUNPT) and    by PSDB (MUNPSDB)</i><a name="tx17" href="#nt17"><sup>17</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second group of determinants to be tested    were those associated with the role of political parties on policy diffusion.    Political parties create new social programs aiming to obtain credibility from    certain electoral groups and also from the society as a whole (Keefer 2005).    In the context of BEP dissemination, PT and PSDB were the parties responsible    for developing the program in Brazil. Aligned with this perspective, this paper    tests whether or not BEP emulation is associated with the administration of    the two parties.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 2</u>: <i>municipalities    governed by PT are more likely to copy BEP in comparison to municipalities governed    by other political parties.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 3</u>: <i>municipalities    governed by PSDB are more likely to copy BEP in comparison to municipalities    governed by other political parties</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Geographical proximity (GEOPROX)</i><a name="tx18" href="#nt18"><sup>18</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fourth variable in the model refers to the    neighborhood effect or geographical proximity among municipalities. As observed    by Walker (1969) geographical proximity can have an impact on the policy diffusion    process. This phenomenon is due to the dissemination of ideas that occur in    events related to public policies, like conferences, seminars, political party    meetings, or in the media. With this approach, the circulation of information    on policy innovation would first reach closer territories. Therefore, municipalities    located close to a municipality that has created a new program would tend to    reproduce their neighbor's experience more often than municipalities from more    distant regions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 4</u>: <i>the closer the    geographical proximity to municipalities that have created Bolsa Escola, the    higher the probability that a municipality will copy its neighbors' idea</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Metropolitan Municipality (METMUN )</i><a name="tx19" href="#nt19"><sup>19</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fifth variable in the model also estimates    the effect of geographical proximity. However, there are two important features    that distinguish it from the last variable presented here. The first is the    location of municipalities in innovative regions, that is, areas that innovate    more in terms of offering public policies in contrast to less creative areas.    The second feature relates to the importance of what could be called "model    cities" of metropolitan areas, seen as a reference and example to be followed.    The literature that deals with this question argues that there is a link between    the "pioneers" and the "emulators", where the element of spatial proximity is    an essential element for program emulation (Walker 1969; Elazar 1972). In their    comparative investigation about the implementation of policies in the North    American federalism, these authors noticed that the most similar states in economic    and social terms tended to emulate their nearest neighbors through the identification    of common problems and the possibility of achieving positive effects. Even though    the emulation-requirements are the position as a neighbor and the similarity    among the federative units, the theory of social networks on policy diffusion    has conceived two contending views in regard to the communication channels.    The <i>fixed-region</i> view presupposes that potentially all units adopting    a program in a region have the same information and are formally and informally    influenced by networks. In contrast to it, the <i>neighborhood-effect </i>view    affirms that each unit is influenced by a specific group of neighboring territorial    units, which are not necessarily of the same region. Following Foster's (1978)    view of <i>follow-the-leader</i> phenomenon, this work considers that BEP is    probably more emulated at metropolitan regions because of the influence of model    cities like S&atilde;o Paulo, Campinas and Santos.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 5</u>: <i>metropolitan municipalities    are more likely to copy Bolsa Escola than non-metropolitan municipalities</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Control Variables</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other variables used in the model are <i>Transfers    from the Government to Poor Families</i> (<i>TRANSFGOVFAM</i>)<a name="tx20" href="#nt20"><sup>20</sup></a><i>and    GDP per Capita (GDPperCAPITA)</i>.<a name="tx21" href="#nt21"><sup>21</sup></a>    Regarding the first variable, this work builds on the studies of Mossberger    (1999), and Welch &amp; Thompson (1980), to investigate the influence of federal    transfers in the adoption of innovative policies. Even though in this particular    case the fiscal incentives are not directly targeted at BEP, I assume that the    higher is the level of welfare dependence of poor families, more likely mayors    will use federal resources to adopt new programs to confront poverty. With the    variable <i>GDPperCapita</i>, I seek to control the possible effect of a municipality's    economic development level on its choice to adopt the program. Population size    is a factor that potentially affects the diffusion of Bolsa Escola and is used    in the model as a control variable. Due to the great diversity of population    size of the municipalities studied,<a name="tx22" href="#nt22"><sup>22</sup></a>    and considering this variable is not linear, the units were grouped in three    categories according to the size of their population: small, medium and large.    The classification by population size was defined according to IPEA, which uses    the following criteria: small municipalities have up to 100.000 habitants, medium    size municipalities between 100.001 and 500.000 habitants and large municipalities    500.000 habitants or more.<a name="tx23" href="#nt23"><sup>23</sup></a> The    effect of municipalities of medium and large populations on the dependent variable    will be tested. These last two categories have greater institutional and fiscal    capacities and, as a consequence, are more likely to create or copy new policies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This group of variables encompassing internal    determinants of Bolsa Escola diffusion in S&atilde;o Paulo state provides important    elements in explaining the phenomenon under analysis. However, the selection    of variables in statistical models is a complex task due to two main complementary    reasons. The first is that the choice of variables must be made through the    use of analytically relevant criteria. The second relates to the exclusion of    omitted-variables that could provide a statistical result that is more robust    and accurate. Like any other academic work, the present study, when using a    statistical model to define the causal relationship between variables, can be    omitting an important covariable. Nevertheless, the applied strategy implies    a methodological choice that aims to adjust the statistical model, and to avoid    the inappropriate use of variables.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03tab1.jpg">Table 1</a> presents the results of the statistical    tests that reveal the effect of the determinants on the probability of local    governments to create/emulate Bolsa Escola. The first four regressions showed    in the table include a mix of variables of the study. In the last regression,    the covariables PT and PSDB were removed from the model in order to estimate    the effect of political competition without controlling by the effect of political    parties. The analysis considers the basic models and aggregates sequentially    the covariables, which allows the definition, in a progressive way, of the variation    of the effect of political competition on the diffusion of BEP.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Results and Analysis of the Statistical Model</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The result of the first model of <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03tab3.jpg">Table 3</a> involves    only the first four covariables and defines the coefficients of MPC, MUNPT and    MUNPSDB as highly significant. In contrast, the coefficient of GDPperCapita    did not prove to be significant. This result suggests that the municipalities'    economic level does not alter the decision to copy or not Bolsa Escola. Moreover,    this result provides empirical evidence to support a strong correlation between    MPC and BEP emulation. In the same way, the result demonstrates that the creation    of the program is highly associated with PT and PSDB administrations.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the second model, the inclusion of two variables    estimating the geographical effect does not modify the general statistical result,    that is, it does not alter the influence of MPC, MUNPT and MUNPSDB on the dependent    variable. This statistic shows that the decision to copy the program is not    directly associated with structural variables and also strengthens the notion    that it is not associated with the municipalities' economic situation.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the third model, when we exclude the two structural    variables and include the transfers from the federal government, it is possible    to notice that the coefficients of MPC, MUNPT and MUNPSDB remain positive and    highly significant. The result again indicates that the coefficients of MPC,    MUNPT and MUNPSDB are robust and have a relevant effect on BEP diffusion.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fourth model includes all variables. Similarly    to the last models, the structural covariable GDPperCAPITA do not show statistical    significance. However, the variable TRANSFGOVFAM presents a positive coefficient    at 10%. This figure indicates that the socioeconomic condition of the population    has partially influenced the decision of emulating BEP. The main variables in    the model - MPC, MUNPT and MUNPSDB - confirm their positive effect on the probability    of emulating BEP. Moreover, the study shows that in the presence of the control    variable "population size", the coefficient of MPC is smaller, and in the presence    of GDPperCAPITA the coefficient is bigger.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, the last model presents the results    of Bolsa Escola diffusion without the presence of PT and PSDB. The goal is to    estimate the influence of the other covariables on the dependent variable, emphasizing    the variation level of the political competition effect, which in the other    models was always significant and positive. The results show that two covariables    do not present any influence on the dependent variable: METMUN and GDPperCAPITA.    For the first time the variable GEOPROX presents a significant coefficient.    This result suggests that municipalities with a high level of political competition    and not governed by PT or PSDB made the decision of emulating BEP influenced    by other municipalities of the neighboring region.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In sum, it can be concluded that the combination    of the covariables, as well as the control variables, does not reduce the relevant    effect of MPC on Bolsa Escola creation, which confirms the statistical and theoretical    importance of this variable on all regressions of the model.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Explaining the Adoption of PGRM in S&atilde;o    Paulo</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This section analyzes the influence of potential    determinant factors on the probability of S&atilde;o Paulo's municipalities    adopting PGRM. The result is obtained through the use of a <i>logit</i> statistical    model, which, in the context of this analysis, captures the probability that    a given municipality will adopt the federal program in the years of 1999 and    2000, according to a set of political, economic and structural factors. Two    models are used to estimate the magnitude of covariables' effect on mayors'    decisions. The first model covers internal and structural determinants, and    the second takes into account the external factor "<i>municipality selected    by the federal government</i>". After the political decision to implement the    PGRM, in 1997, the federal government requested a study from IPEA, in order    to indicate the poorest municipalities of the country where the resident population    needed cash transfers as a complement to the family income. IPEA pointed to    approximately 3,300 municipalities in this situation. Due to the high volume    of investments that the policy would demand to assist all municipalities in    the first year of execution, an arbitrary criterion of selection was used. This    criterion consisted of a scheduled execution through which the poorest municipalities    were the first to become eligible to PGRM, in an increasing scale that added    20% of the municipalities per year for each state, until reaching the final    point in which all municipalities were included in PGRM. Thus, the program was    created to assist on a priority-basis the municipalities with a <i>tax collection    per capita and income per capita below the state average. </i>However, as explained    by Ana Lobato,<a name="tx24" href="#nt24"><sup>24</sup></a> coordinator of the    IPEA-study that mapped the situation of the municipalities, there was a strong    interference by mayors and governors, who were dissatisfied with the list after    it was presented. According to governmental managers,<a name="tx25" href="#nt25"><sup>25</sup></a>    mayors went to the point of presenting their own calculations based on consultancy    works and on data gathered by IBGE, in their attempt to delegitimize the technical    study of IPEA. Thus, this variable works as a control variable due to its direct    influence on mayors' decisions. The main goal here is to analyze, based on qualitative    data and statistical results, whether or not the rules of adherence to PGRM    altered the process of policy diffusion, once municipalities that were not selected    were actually prevented from adhering to the program.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The figures on <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03tab4.jpg">Table 4</a> present the adherence    to PGRM in S&atilde;o Paulo, listed by political party. As expected, PSDB, as    the party with the largest number of municipalities meeting the rules of selection    for the program, had the highest rate of adherence. Of the 69 city halls governed    by the party, 66 signed agreements with the federal government. The same situation    occurred in municipalities governed by PFL and PMDB as second and third places,    respectively. Of the 42 municipalities governed by PFL, 35 adhered to PGRM,    and of the 32 governed by PMDB, 25 did the same. Together, the three parties    added to approximately 75% of total adhesions to the program. PT was only in    office in two municipalities among the 173 eligible to adopt the policy, and    one of them adhered to the program.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Due to the fact that the PGRM was implemented    in only two years, it is unnecessary and pointless to draw a graph to describe    the yearly trajectory of the program. The appropriate illustration in this case    is outlined in <a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03fig3.jpg">Figure 3</a>, where it is possible to visualize how diffusion took    place in a decentralized way throughout the regions.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The adherence of municipalities to PGRM and the    political strategies of formulation and implementation allow us to categorize    the phenomenon of policy diffusion as <i>coordinated and interconnected</i>.    The concept, developed by Levi-Faur (2005), defines this type of political process    as an action coordinated by certain institutions or party with the power to    redesign the provision of public policies. However, due to its rules of selection,    which are not stable from the political standpoint, the diffusion-process of    PGRM is also characterized as a competitive process, because in practical terms,    the chances that a municipality had of adhering to the program affected the    chances of adherence by other municipalities. The following section presents    a description of the statistical model that was used to analyze the hypothesis    testing of the study.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Describing the Logit Model, Variables and    Hypotheses</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The <i>logit</i> model allows an estimation of    the chances (<i>odds</i>) that a specific event will occur under a group of    factors that affects the dependent variable. In this study, the model will be    applied to test the probability of S&atilde;o Paulo's municipalities adhering    to PGRM in the presence of a set of structural, internal and external covariables    that potentially affected the decision. Despite the simplicity of the statistical    model used, it represents a feasible alternative to explaining the fast diffusion    of PGRM in S&atilde;o Paulo state. At the same time, it is prudent to be aware    of the fact that the model might not be estimating the most appropriate result    concerning the causal relationship between the covariables and the dependent    variable. The statistical result, however, will certainly shed light on the    problem studied in this paper, which will provide important inferences. The    model's equation is described as follows:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Model</u>: Adopting RM = 1n (Pi/1-Pi)    = &#945; + &#946;1 (political alignment with GF) + &#946;2 (president's party    - PSDB) + &#946;3 (municipal political competition) + &#946;4 (municipal GDP)    + &#946;5 (per capita income) + &#946;6 (municipality selected by GF).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Dependent Variable</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The dependent variable of the model, Adherence    to PGRM (Ad PGRM), is a <i>dummy</i> with values "0" and "1", corresponding    respectively to municipalities that did not adhere to the program and to those    that did so in the years of 1999 and 2000. The research universe covers all    645 municipalities of S&atilde;o Paulo state. Out of this total, only 195 could    adhere to the program in the first two years of program execution due to the    rules imposed by the federal government, which selected municipalities according    to the criteria of family per capita income in 1991 and per capita self-generated    revenues (own tax income) in 1996, both below the state's average. For municipalities    that adhered to the program, regardless of whether they were selected or not,    "1" was considered as the answer.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Independent Variables</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The statistical model used in this study tests    the effect of a set of independent variables associated with the internal, structural    and external factors of the phenomenon being analyzed.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Political Alignment with Federal Government    (POLALIN)</i><a name="tx26" href="#nt26"><sup>26</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The main independent variable to be tested in    the model is the political alignment between the federal and municipal governments.    The literature that deals with this question in all its complexities shows that    party alignment between different spheres of government influences the distribution    of financial resources in favor of the aligned parties (Cox and McCubbins, 1993).    In the context of PGRM diffusion, PT and PDT are considered to be PSDB rivals    in the national arena, and, therefore, not politically aligned. The other parties    are classified as aligned. Although there are situations in which aligned parties    do not effectively support the actions of the federal government, they do not    have a direct strategy of confronting the president's party. Following this    perspective, we seek to test the effect of POLALIN on PGRM diffusion. If the    result of the model does not prove the covariable to be significant, it will    be concluded that adherence to the program was guided by rigid rules. On the    contrary, if the coefficient is statistically significant and positive signed,    it indicates that the rules were circumvented by municipalities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 6</u>: <i>political alignment    between the municipality and the federal government favors an adherence to PGRM,    regardless of the adherence rules</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>President's party (PARTPRE)</i><a name="tx27" href="#nt27"><sup>27</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The covariable PARTPRE is included in the model    as it represents one of the dimensions of the political context of PGRM diffusion.    Considering the political dispute over BEP between PSDB, the party of the federal    government, and PT, it is reasonable to assume that municipalities governed    by the former will adhere more to PGRM than municipalities governed by other    parties, regardless of the adherence rules. The main goal here is to verify    whether municipalities administered by PSDB and not able to adhere to the program    were privileged by the federal government. If the statistical coefficient is    significant and positively signed, it is evidenced that PGRM diffusion was not    guided by existing rules. If the contrary is found, this suggests that diffusion    was guided by technical criteria and rules.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 7</u>: <i>municipalities    governed by the president's party are more likely to adhere to PGRM in comparison    to municipalities governed by other political parties, regardless of the adherence    rules.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Municipal Political Competition (MPC)</i><a name="tx28" href="#nt28"><sup>28</sup></a></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The covariable MPC is employed in the model in    order to test the effect of political competitiveness on PGRM diffusion. Although    PGRM showed a distinct configuration in relation to BEP, especially due to the    fact that the federal government requires the fulfillment of some criteria and    was responsible for funding part of the program's costs, its implementation    certainly brought political dividends to local politicians that sought their    political survival. At the same time, policymakers claim credit for policy innovations    in the territory they govern, aiming to increase their chances of political    survival (Keefer 2005). Furthermore, even considering that PGRM configuration    comprises a relationship from the federal government to municipality government,    the decision to participate in the game is the exclusive responsibility of the    local executive and it implies a rational calculus that takes into account the    municipality's electoral competition. Therefore, it is expected that the most    competitive units will be more likely to adhere to PGRM than less competitive    municipalities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&#149; <u>Hypothesis 8</u>: <i>the stronger the    municipal electoral competition, the more likely municipalities will adhere    to PGRM, regardless of the adherence rules</i>.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other variables included in the model are    <i>Municipal GDP </i>(<i>GDPMUN</i>)<a name="tx29" href="#nt29"><sup>29</sup></a>    and the percentage of children with family income below half the minimum wage    (<i>FAMWAGE</i>).<a name="tx30" href="#nt30"><sup>30</sup></a> <i>GDPMUN</i>    represents an internal determinant highlighted by the literature as likely to    alter the diffusion phenomenon as units with larger fiscal and administrative    capacity have better institutional conditions to afford the costs of implementing    social policies. In the case of PGRM, however, the effect of GDP can be analyzed    from another perspective. Due to the rule that focused the program in less economically    developed municipalities, it is expected that this covariable will not show    any statistical significance. If this result is confirmed, it will be possible    to conclude that the program was guided by non biased rules. On the contrary,    if it is statistically proven that municipalities that adhered to PGRM were    those with higher GDPs, there will be an important sign that the rules were    disregarded. <i>FAMWAGE </i>is also a potential internal determinant of PGRM    diffusion. This covariable is included in the model because it represents the    percentage of children from families that have a <i>per capita</i> income below    half the minimum wage at the time the program was implemented. By analyzing    the rules and criteria of PGRM, it can be concluded that the program is oriented    to benefit municipalities with the largest number of families with poor children.    As a consequence, the indicator adopted in the model makes it possible to know    whether municipalities with those characteristics were in fact the ones that    most adhered to the program. Therefore, it is likely that a statistically significant    and positive signed coefficient for this covariable will be found.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Control Variable</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The control variable employed in this study is    <i>Municipality Selected by the Federal Government</i> (<i>MUNGOV</i>). This    variable is important because significantly increased the chances that a specific    municipality adhered to PGRM. Once selected, the mayor just had to accept some    requirements of the agreement with the federal government in order to formally    adhere to the program. The category of non-selected or selected for the following    years implies a situation in which mayors were forced to negotiate the inclusion    of their municipalities in the program. As a result, these municipalities' chances    of adhering to PGRM were smaller in comparison to the probability of adherence    of selected municipalities. Given what has been exposed, it can be concluded    that this factor alters the scale of PGRM diffusion. Therefore, we performed    a test in the <i>logit</i> model that estimated the influence of <i>MUNGOV</i>    on the covariables in relation to the dependent variable <i>Adherence to PGRM</i>.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Results and Analysis of the Statistical Model</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v6n2/a03tab5.jpg">Table 5</a> presents the coefficients obtained from    the estimation of internal and external determinants in the two statistical    models. The first reports the results of independent variables based on the    theories of political competition and political alignment as well as the economic    covariables. The second reproduces the results after adding the structural variable    MUNGOV, which controls the effect of the other variables on the probability    of adhering to PGRM.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Model 1 suggests that the political alignment    of municipalities with the federal government, or being governed by the same    party of the president, do not influence the likelihood of adherence to PGRM.    It is possible to partially conclude that the party configuration of the national    and municipal level is not part of the explanation of PGRM diffusion. In relation    to the variable that tests the electoral competition hypothesis (MPC), it can    be verified that its coefficient has statistical significance at 5%, but is    negatively signed. Thus, the indices suggest a situation in which the greater    the municipal political competition, the smaller the probability of adhering    to PGRM. The result is complex and deserves to be analyzed carefully. A feasible    explanation would be the fact that mayors who govern noncompetitive municipalities    will probably be less exposed to the voters' oversight, and, therefore, more    likely to adhere to federal programs once they have incentives to manage the    offering of welfare services. Moreover, acting in environments with low levels    of accountability,<a name="tx31" href="#nt31"><sup>31</sup></a> mayors are more    prone to adhere to policies funded by other governmental spheres, since if they    fail to accomplish the contract's requirements, rival parties would not, in    practice, try to use this failure to their own political advantage.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The economic variable GDPMUN does not have any    statistical value in the model, revealing a situation in which municipalities'    wealth is not an important variable to explain PGRM diffusion in S&atilde;o    Paulo state. In this case, the result suggests that the program's rules were    in fact enforced and benefited less economic developed municipalities and, in    theory, the poorer population. FAMWAGE is the only covariable in the model that    shows statistical significance and positive sign. To some extent, the effect    of GDPMUN and FAMWAGE together indicates that the program was oriented effectively    to benefit the poor population in less economically developed municipalities.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aiming to test the consistency of the last result's    estimates, model 2 includes the control variable MUNGOV. Considering the first    three covariables, they remain practically unchanged. The coefficients of POLALIN    and PARTPRE remain statistically negligible and do not explain PGRM diffusion.    In the presence of the control variable, MPC remains statistically significant    and with a negative sign. The covariables GDPMUN and FAMWAGE repeat the previous    result. The former proves to be irrelevant, which corroborates the notion that    the program has benefited less economically developed municipalities. The latter    confirms, once again, the strong correlation with the dependent variable by    achieving significance at 1%. As a consequence, it is possible to statistically    evaluate that the program did reach the poorer population and was guided by    technical criteria. However, as it will be discussed in the conclusion, this    result must be complemented by a qualitative analysis.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="3"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This article sought to identify the factors that    explain the decision of municipalities to create and adhere to cash transfer    programs. The analysis investigated the phenomenon of Bolsa Escola emulation    among municipalities and also the municipal governments' adherence to the program    created by the federal government that represents an upscaled version of the    municipalities' model. Indeed, the strategy of political entrepreneurs aiming    to establish minimum income projects at the national level faced strong resistance    in the federal arena and also in the sphere of political parties. The political    strategy adopted by senators Eduardo Suplicy and Cristovam <i>Buarque was one    of the factors that determined not only the creation of the program, but also    its dissemination over the years. Suplicy (from PT) surprisingly proposed the    design of PGRM/Bolsa Escola to Jos&eacute; Roberto Magalh&atilde;es Teixeira    (PSDB), who was Campinas' mayor at the time. Buarque, despite not having the    support of PT's national leaders, launched a version of BEP in Bras&iacute;lia    when he was the governor of the Federal District. The two pioneering experiences    were emulated by other municipalities and states, especially those governed    by PT and PSDB. Since then, both parties started competing over and claiming    credit for the policy.</i></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The dispute between the two parties occurred    both in informal (the media) and formal (municipal, state level and national    legislative bodies) political arenas. Some evidence that supports this conclusion    is the fact that the two parties proposed and approved the largest number of    legislative projects aiming at creating new programs. In general, PT demonstrated    a higher internal cohesion and promoted the program in more states and municipalities,    whereas PSDB implemented federal programs, even though it also sponsored their    dissemination across municipalities governed by the party.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The analysis of the policy diffusion in S&atilde;o    Paulo suggests that BEP creation is directly associated with the factors <i>Political    Competition</i> and <i>Municipalities Governed by PT and PSDB</i>. The covariables'    coefficients are positive and statistically significant in all regressions.    When the covariables <i>Municipalities Governed by PT</i> (MUNPT) and Municipalities    governed by PSDB (MUNPSDB) are excluded from the model, <i>Municipal Political    Competition</i> (MPC) maintained high statistical significance. Hence, results    confirm the role of local political competition in the horizontal diffusion    of innovative social policies. This conclusion is supported by the statistical    comparison indicating that program emulation occurred more often in municipalities    more politically competitive and governed by PT and PSDB. An important finding    of this study is that the geographical proximity does not affect the diffusion    of BEP. More specifically, this variable seems to be more important in diffusion    processes of less contentious policies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In relation to PGRM, this study suggests two    explanatory factors for the program's adoption at the local level. Firstly,    the attention of political elites, which was raised by BEP diffusion. Secondly,    the pressure from a group of politicians and parties that aimed to implement    the program in their constituencies. The statistical modeling shows that municipalities    are governed by <i>Mayors from the President's Party</i> (PARTPRE) or <i>Politically    Aligned</i> (POLALIN) with the federal government was not relevant in favoring    adherence to PGRM. The variable that estimated the effect of <i>Municipal Political    Competition</i> (MPC) did not influence the diffusion of PGRM either. Unlike    the case of Bolsa Escola, the probability of adhering to PGRM was higher in    noncompetitive political environments. Therefore, the hypothesis that greater    rates of adherence to PGRM would be expected in competitive environments was    not confirmed. However, an important consideration must be kept in mind. According    to descriptive analysis, the selection rules were subject to political pressure    to benefit the wealthier municipalities, especially by parties aligned with    the federal government. This mechanism changed the diffusion of the policy both    in S&atilde;o Paulo and nationally. Despite the evidence found in the qualitative    analysis indicating that the program was not entirely guided by technical criteria    (Amaral 1998; Rocha and Garcia 2001), our empirical evidence suggests that variables    related to political incentives are not correlated with the adoption of PGRM:    both FAMWAGE and MUNGOV induced local governments to emulate the program. This    finding allows us to affirm that the mechanisms that drive the emulation of    PGRM across Brazil's cities were guided by formal rules, rather than political    criteria.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In sum, based on these results it can be concluded    that the phenomenon of BEP diffusion was a process that developed horizontally    and, by the time it had created impacts on the political system, it started    to develop in a top-down fashion. The article general conclusion is that the    nature of political competition is a factor that influences horizontal and vertical    diffusion processes. Political competition engenders incentives for the establishment    of redistributive programs. Thus, a competitive political environment is associated    with a greater propensity for adopting these kind of policies.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, it is possible to identify different    dynamics in horizontal and vertical diffusion. For top-down (that is, vertical)    diffusion, the influence of an actor or a group of external actors play an important    role. In sum, local political competition matters to a greater extent to horizontal    diffusion but to a smaller extent concerning vertical diffusion. In the specific    case of PGRM, the external influence is represented by the resources transferred    by the federal government. In this case, the influence was so intense that it    neutralized other causal factors, including political competition.

Nonetheless, a large scale process    of experimentation occurred effectively from the 1990s on.    <br>   <a name="nt2" href="#tx2">2</a> It is important to mention a particularity of    the municipal Bolsa Escola. The target population varied across municipalities:    originally, the age cut-off was from 0 to 14 years old. However, the vast majority    of the municipalities adopted an age cut-off of 7-14 years old. Furthermore,    it is worth highlighting that these cut-offs included both primary and secondary    education.    <br>   <a name="nt3" href="#tx3">3</a> Hereafter, the Bolsa Escola programs will be    referred to as follows: Bolsa Escola Program (BEP) when referring to the programs    created by municipalities, and PGRM and Bolsa Escola Federal when referring    to the two programs created by the federal government.    <br>   <a name="nt4" href="#tx4">4</a> Research indicates that between 80 and 200 municipalities    created the municipal Bolsa Escola (Aguiar and Ara&uacute;jo, 2002; Villatoro,    2005). However, it is important to note that many proposals were not approved,    or approved but not implemented. Moreover, in many cities the state and federal    level programs of Minimum Income executed by the municipalities were incorrectly    considered as municipal-level programs.    <br>   <a name="nt5" href="#tx5">5</a> For additional information on policy diffusion,    see the contributions of Dolowitz and Marsch (1996, 2000); Elkins and Simmons    (2005), and Weyland (2004, 2005, 2007).    <br>   <a name="nt6" href="#tx6">6</a> The classic study by Downs (1999) states that    rational choice politics is based on a calculus that takes into account the    cost-benefit relationship that political actors face when choosing between feasible    alternatives. According to Ferejohn and Pasquino (2001), rational political    choice is a specific act chosen among the best acts available to the agent,    given his beliefs and desires. In the context of competition among innovative    policies, the literature states that the more competitive parties are, the highest    is the likelihood of parties to suggest new social programs.    <br>   <a name="nt7" href="#tx7">7</a> Downs (1999: 31) defines actors' rational behavior    as follows: "a rational man who systematically making mistakes will stop doing    so if (1) he figures out what is the mistake and (2) the cost of its elimination    is less than its benefits".    <br>   <a name="nt8" href="#tx8">8</a> In this context, ideology is understood as a    model of thoughts and beliefs that explain individuals' general attitudes and    their responsive relation with the society. This definition comes from Lowenstein    (1953) cited in Gerring (1997), and differs from Downs' notion that considers    ideology as a resource used by groups to reach power.    <br>   <a name="nt9" href="#tx9">9</a> The present study considers both programs as    distinct political actions, once they were created by distinct governmental    bodies: mayors and the president. Therefore, these programs can be characterized    as local and national policies.    <br>   <a name="nt10" href="#tx10">10</a> The explanation of the rules for the adoption    of PGRM is presented in the section "Explaining adoption to PGRM in S&atilde;o    Paulo".    <br>   <a name="nt11" href="#tx11">11</a> The principal reason is that there are notable    differences among groups of political parties in many states of the Federation,    and the focus on S&atilde;o Paulo allows one to control this variation. Other    secondary reasons supporting this choice are: the state of S&atilde;o Paulo    comprises half of the cases across the country; the municipal chambers and legislative    assembly of S&atilde;o Paulo state were the institutions that presented the    highest number of proposals for the creation of minimum wage programs; Campinas,    the municipality that first created Bolsa Escola, is the unit of analysis that    represents the temporal starting point of the study.    <br>   <a name="nt12" href="#tx12">12</a> STATA: Release 10.

Dichotomous variable defined as: i) competitive political system    when a candidate wins the elections with less than 45% of the valid votes (assuming    value = 1), and ii) noncompetitive political system when a candidate wins municipal    elections with more than 45% of the valid votes (assuming value = 0). All the    municipalities that had a second round were automatically classified as competitive.    <br>   <a name="nt17" href="#tx17">17</a> Municipalities governed by PT: Dichotomous    variable that informs the municipalities governed by PT that created Bolsa Escola,    with the values 1 = yes and 0 = no. Municipalities governed by PSDB: Dichotomous    variable that informs the municipalities governed by PSDB that created Bolsa    Escola, with 1= yes and 0 = no.    <br>   <a name="nt18" href="#tx18">18</a> Geographical Proximity: calculated by Moran    Index, a statistical tool that provides a general measure of the spatial association    between units distributed in a specific universe. In the models applied in this    study, this variable estimates the spatial autocorrelation between the municipalities    that created Bolsa Escola. The value close to 1 indicates a situation in which    the decision to copy Bolsa Escola was significantly affected by the preceding    choice made by geographically close municipalities. The value close to -1 indicates    the opposite situation.    <br>   <a name="nt19" href="#tx19">19</a> Metropolitan Municipality: represents the    municipalities located in the three metropolitan areas of S&atilde;o Paulo state    that created Bolsa Escola in subsequent years after their neighbors. The variable    assumes the following values: "1" to those municipalities that created Bolsa    Escola after their neighbors did so and "0" to municipalities that did not create    Bolsa Escola subsequent to their neighbors.    <br>   <a name="nt20" href="#tx20">20</a> Transfers from the Government to Poor Families:    represents the percentage of inhabitants of S&atilde;o Paulo's municipalities    whose family income depended more than 50% on cash transfers from the federal    government between 1991 and 2000.    <br>   <a name="nt21" href="#tx21">21</a> GDPperCapita: The used measure is the average    of the municipal GDP per inhabitant, measured by the IBGE between 1997 and 2001.    <br>   <a name="nt22" href="#tx22">22</a> The smallest municipality has a population    of 800 inhabitants and the largest one (S&atilde;o Paulo capital) over 10 million    people.    <br>   <a name="nt23" href="#tx23">23</a> For a discussion on the population size of    Brazilian municipalities, see Andrade and Serra (2001).    <br>   <a name="nt24" href="#tx24">24</a> Interview with the author on March 28, 2008.

MEC/Federal Government;    and S&ocirc;nia Moreira, former Technical Manager of the Minimum-Income Program/Federal    Government.    <br>   <a name="nt26" href="#tx26">26</a> Political Alignment: dichotomous variable    defined as follows: i) parties politically aligned with the federal government    (value = 1), and ii) parties not aligned politically with the federal government    (value = 0).    <br>   <a name="nt27" href="#tx27">27</a> President's party: Dichotomous variable that    evidences the municipalities governed by the party of the president (PSDB) that    created PGRM, with values 1 = yes and 0 = no.    <br>   <a name="nt28" href="#tx28">28</a> See endnote number 15.    <br>   <a name="nt29" href="#tx29">29</a> Municipal GDP: represented the average GDP    of S&atilde;o Paulo's municipalities between 1999 and 2001.    <br>   <a name="nt30" href="#tx30">30</a> This variable represents the average family    income per inhabitant in 1991. For the statistical calculation, the index of    2002 for twenty municipalities that were emancipated after 1991 was considered.    <br>   <a name="nt31" href="#tx31">31</a> For a discussion on the concept and types    of accountability (vertical and horizontal), see O'Donnell (1991).</font></p>      </div></div><!--cc--><!--mode=license--><!--GENERAL_LICENSE--><div xmlns="" class="license"><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt"><img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/80x15.png" alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0"></a> <!--issue-->Todo o conteúdo deste periódico, exceto onde está identificado, está licenciado sob uma <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/deed.pt">Licença Creative Commons</a></p></div>

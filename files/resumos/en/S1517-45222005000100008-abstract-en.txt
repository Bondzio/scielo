The article firstly presents the historical, cultural, epistemological and methodological differences between the categories of social control and punitive (State) control, linking the latter to continental European tradition. Therefore, the generic reference to the idea of "social regulation", often used in several disciplinary fields, is the object of analysis in relation to that of social control, born and employed within very precise cultural scenario and historical period. In any case, and within multidisciplinary approaches related to globalization of society and control of the population, the author thinks that we should reject any glimmer of application of punishment with an "organizational", controlling" or "regulating" sense that emerges from modern criminal systems. A second part of the work approaches the impact that - in the author's opinion - changes on the notions of time and space have in the field of physical-mathematical disciplines, regarding the control that is to be exercised through means that are traditionally seen as instruments for social control. Therefore, the aim is to explain the distance that separates - in social and legal disciplines - concepts and institutions when it is presumed that both can be eternally suitable for the same ends. That is so because forms of knowledge are absolutely connected and pervaded by phenomena that, coming from societies' economic spheres, cross al their levels. Based on those elements we advance to a third part in the presentation, which is related to globalization and the distinct phenomena resulting from it, especially the approach of changes seen in what can be currently understood as social control.

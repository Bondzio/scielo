Abstract In the middle of the last century, the Xetá, an indigenous group of Tupi-Guarani speakers that had been subjected to different forms of violence, consolidated contact with the whites in serra dos Dourados, in the northwest of the state of Paraná. On that occasion, José Loureiro Fernandes and Vladimir Kozák, researchers from the Federal University of Paraná, made expeditions to the area, leaving for posterity important records (field notebooks, correspondence, articles and films) about the newly contacted group. In this article I deal with the uses of the documents produced by both, indicating, above all, how they have served new researchers and the Indigenous people themselves for political ends: either toward the demarcation of the traditional territory of the Xetá - a process that has not yet been concluded by the government - or toward the recognition of the violence suffered by the group.

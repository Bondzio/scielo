Abstract: The reproduction of the peasantry, as a family-economic unit and social class, has become a global concern. The food emergency and the need for sustainable forms of production have pushed up the family farming as an alternative solution; for this reason, the scientific activity invests in studying the diversity of family forms and changes in livelihood strategies and social reproduction. The article presented is a review about the factors involved in the reproduction of the peasantry in Cuba, result of theoretical reconstruction achieved from the sociology of knowledge. This theoretical and methodological perspective establishes the dialectical relationship between scientific knowledge that has occurred, and the social context of reference; also describes the context of implementation of economic policies and social transformations that reflects the science about the countryside. The main result lies in determining the forms of manifestation of economic, cultural and social capital, which is the result of data's interpretation using content analysis and that support from a socio-historical perspective, understanding the peasantry and their reproduction, as a case study for science in Cuba.

The aim of this paper is to identify determinants of demand and access to rural credit by beef cattle farmers in the São Paulo State. Primary data were collected from 86 beef cattle farmers through a questionnaire survey. The empirical analysis of the survey data is performed with the estimation of a logit model. The results show that all farmers who demanded credit in 2010 had access to it. The logit model results showed that farmers who own more farms are more intensive in production technology, receive non-farm activities income, are younger, adopt price risk management and are members of organizations related to rural production have higher probability to demand and access rural credit. Finally, some suggestions were presented for the rural credit policy for beef cattle in São Paulo State.

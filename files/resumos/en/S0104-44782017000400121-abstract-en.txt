Abstract This bibliographic essay analyzes the literature known as &#8220;ideational turn&#8221;. Its purpose is, firstly, to summarize the criticisms of this literature to the institutionalist perspectives with which it dialogues; Secondly, to systematize its theoretical advantages and, finally, to identify the methodological tools used by researchers affiliated to it. The essay is based on the analysis of a wide range of books and articles published on the subject mostly over the last twenty years. Through this bibliographic review, we were able to show how the literature of the ideational turn allows us to include ideas in the explanations of political phenomena. The inclusion of ideas, in turn, requires a pluralistic methodological stance that can represent important advances for political science.

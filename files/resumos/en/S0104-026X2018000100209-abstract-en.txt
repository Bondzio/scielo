Abstract: In this article we explore the experience of a woman engineer during a process of participatory and action research in a self-managed coal mine in Crici√∫ma (SC). We built a report that does not refute to evidence the reproduction of hierarchical gender patterns, but which focus is to situate specific scenes through which we complexify power relationships of gender - permeated by class and race - and give visibility to oppositional attitudes performed by women. This work is the result of a dialogue between the engineer who entered the mines and an engineer researcher of gender relations, whose paths encountered in the struggle for a counter-hegemonic engineering. Inspired by feminist epistemologies, here we launch light on margins and strategies of resistance that are under analyzed and that, however, contribute to the daily struggle of deconstruction of power relations.

Abstract This article deals with the idea of social investment given by the European Union in the peculiar current context of cuts of social expenses and reinforcement of the economic governance. With this aim, the work focuses specially in the initiatives provided by the EU, mainly by the Comission from the breakout of the crisis. Thus, this analysis takes firstly into account those European proposals aimed to achieve 2020 objectives, emphasazing the double intervention EU Member States. Considering these initiatives we deal with the contribution of the recently launched Package for the social investment on the reform of the social policies, answering to the demographic and financial challenges of the EU. Finally, we question to which extent there is an effective link between the Commission's recommendations promoting social investment and the Member States policies in the new economic governance framework.

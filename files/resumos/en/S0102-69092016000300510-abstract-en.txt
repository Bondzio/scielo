Using Ernesto Laclau1s discourse theory, the purpose of this article is to analyze the role of the promotion of democracy in the U.S. foreign policy during George W. Bush&#8217;s administration (2001-2008). The hypothesis explored in the article is that the notion of liberal democracy, as presented in the documents of the Ameri- can foreign policy of the period, can be understood as an empty signifier, given that it condenses in itself a broad range of meanings: it is seen not only as the best and fairest political and economic system, but also as the one that, today, enables the countries to perform essential state tasks in a more efficient fashion. As a consequence, this construction of meaning has contributed to justify and naturalize controversial U.S. foreign policy actions, such as military interventions and regime changes in Afghanistan and Iraq.

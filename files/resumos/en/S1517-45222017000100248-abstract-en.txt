Abstract Taking the debates about the civil code reform bill in Argentina (2010), which extends the recognition of the matrimonial institution to same sex couples, this work proposes to investigate the religious senses incorporated in the parliamentary speeches opposing this change. From the speeches in both legislative chambers (nationals Deputies and Senators) that shapes what we name a field of parliamentary opposition, a set of categories are proposed to catch the emergency of the religious dimension in the parliamentary debate, when the legislative power decides the future of the reform bill. Thus, this work aims to put into tension the links between the religious and the political when the sexuality becomes a matter of public debate.

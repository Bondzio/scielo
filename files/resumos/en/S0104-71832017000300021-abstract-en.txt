Abstract: This article approaches the development of diverse anthropological movements just as well the relevance of the anthropological researches nowadays. It discusses the role of the cultural traditions in the development of the research areas that cross international cultural borders, as a central point in the anthropological research. The Anthropological transnational approach composes and powers the spirit of investigation in order to expand knowledge and enable the establishment of new investigation paradigms. This process is evidenced by results of studies on ethnographic case with German and Japanese families about family well-being, from an anthropological perspective.

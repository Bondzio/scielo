ABSTRACT The following article seeks to expand on a new indicator of the geographical scattering of votes presented by Avelino, Biderman and Silva in an article published in DADOS Journal in 2011, extending its use to encompass candidates in Brazilian elections held from 1994 to 2014. The results systematically demonstrate that support for successful candidates was more scattered than that for defeated candidates, with the article&#8217;s most original feature lying in the fact that such a finding contradicts theories assuming the predominance of votes for individuals in proportional Brazilian elections.

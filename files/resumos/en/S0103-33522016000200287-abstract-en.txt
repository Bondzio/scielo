Abstract This paper intends to show the notion of non-indifference, the main innovation of the Brazilian foreign policy since the first term of Lula presidency, as an anti-hegemonic reaction in the current crisis of the world capitalism. By relativizing the principle of sovereignty, the Brazilian version of non-indifference is open to the supportive engagement in those situations of humanitarian or political crises, providing it has been invited to participate. Because of its association to mutual economic development and deep commitment to democratic values, non-indifference has become quite supportive in promoting Latin American cooperation, showing especial connection to the &#8220;family&#8221; of antisystemic practices due to its humanitarian and pacifist components together with a long diplomatic tradition of tolerance and negotiation, an uncommon set of behavior within the interstate system. Because of such peculiarities, the notion of non-indifference may become the basis of the building up of a truly new ideological community of conscience of the Global South.

Abstract This study aims to understand the conflicts and materializations constituents of LGBT deaths claimed by the Movement as hate crimes. For this, I have made an ethnographic work with the LGBT Movement in Para√≠ba, interviews with activists and I have analysed inquiries and judicial proceedings. The research is based on three thematizations: a) the discursive use of the brutalities acts on the identity of the Movement; b) the images of brutality used by the Movement perform the victim&#8217;s bodies and participate of the construction of these bodies as victimized by the homophobia; and c) the conflicts between Movement and state sectors manipulate the crime materiality and, consequently, the body materiality.

Abstract This article proposes a critical analysis of Pierre Bourdieu&#8217;s contribution to the field of religious studies. First, we will demonstrate how the concept of field enabled a new understanding of the classical notion of religion. Subsequently, taking contemporary secularism as a reference, we will examine the analytical inaccuracy of this concept to give a full comprehension of the presence of religions in the public scene. Finally, taking into account some contributions of the French pragmatic theory for a definition of a public arena, this article proposes a new approach to the classical problem of religion and power relations. We assume that what religions do in the public sphere transform the collective understanding of what counts as religion.

Abstract: This article makes a reflection on the relations between political perspectives and millenarian expectations in Alejo Carpentier&#8217;s The kingdom of this world (1949). Initially, we identified some political and cultural elements that influenced Carpentier in the period prior to the publication of The Kingdom of This World. In the sequence, we present a sketch of the work and analyze the relations between myth and history in the text. Finally, starting from a comparative perspective between the three political-revolutionary processes presented in the book (the rebellion of Mackandal, the monarchy of Henri Christophe and the mulatto republic), we will try to present the millenarian movement of Mackandal as the only one in fact utopian and revolutionary, which, even if it failed, continued to impregnate with hope the spirit of the oppressed in Haiti.

Today, gender-based violence has crossed all social barriers, with millions of women considering it a fact of life. Among all kinds of gender-based violence, the trafficking of women is perhaps the most important, for women are sold in the sex market for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Evidence shows that at present gender-based violence causes more deaths than diseases and accidents. The main objective of this study is to show that the trafficking of women remains as a form of sexual exploitation and violence against women in Mexico. The data has been obtained in Tapachula, a town in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.

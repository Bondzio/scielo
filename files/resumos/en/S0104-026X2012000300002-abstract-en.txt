The goal of this work is to sketch and reconstruct Feminist Genealogies from a southern perspective. It aims to articulate a philosophical reflection on women's political past and the disperse fragments of the history of women (herstory) in Our America. This reading will be based on the Benjaminian thought about the relationship between past and present. From this point of view, the past that concerns subalterns is the jetzt zeit, a present time that is fed from the regard to the past. Namely, in this case, the relationship between a significant time of the History of Our America - the time of the Independence Wars during the nineteen century - and the present. At the time new horizons were opened, then anticipated as the inauguration of a new time and a new political order. This reflection is focused on the relationship between body, politics and History/Herstory with the attempt to build situated and critical knowledge against the idea of the a-historical character of subordination of women, to transform it into what Genevieve Fraisse called a "querelle", that is a timeless debate in which the endless repetition of the same situation is at play. In this note we will discuss how and why this operation multiplies in the case of the southern women.

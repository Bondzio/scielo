The aim of this study is to verify to what extent the technologies coming from the green revolution were effectively adopted in sub-Saharan Africa, and, in cases in which they were adopted, if succeeded in improving agricultural productivity and income. To this end, the work makes first a brief summary of the State of the arts of the green revolution in Africa, showing which countries have advanced more and how the use of chemical fertilizers correlates with productivity increases. The article also discusses the characteristics of the intensification process in a particular case, of Mozambique. Finally, based on micro data of the Agricultural Survey (TIA), an econometric model MQO is tested, aiming to assess the determinants of agricultural income, and, in particular, the use of chemical fertilizers.

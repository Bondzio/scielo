Abstract Spain is analyzed as a laboratory where strategies of mobilization against sexual and women's rights based on the discourse of the &#8220;gender ideology&#8221; have been tried by ultraconservative and Catholic actors. Four moments are reviewed: the discourse of the Catholic Church, as the original source of this new moral panic language; Progressive legal reforms that trigger the cycle of protest; Social contestation of the conservative groups and the moderate conservative reaction from the government.

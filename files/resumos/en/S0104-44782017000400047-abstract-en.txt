Abstract The paper aims to analyze the determinations of the recent period of youth political participation in Argentina, which highlights the importance of the political parties. After a deep crisis of political representation &#8211;that led youth activism to the impugnation of politics in connection to the State and party representation&#8211;, political parties recreated youth activism spaces and became receptors, at the same time, for new activists joining politics. In this process, the ruling parties at a national and subnational level need to be investigated in order to understand the mutations on the youth political participation. This paper seeks to analyze the features, properties and characteristics that shaped a new figure of activism among youth in relation to these experiences. More specifically, it focuses in the way in which they get involved in politics, the meanings given to political commitment, and the connection between their simultaneous conditions of young activists and workers of the public administration, regarding two parties: the Partido Socialista activists, which is the governing party in Santa Fe Province, and Propuesta Republicana activists, the ruling party in the city of Buenos Aires. To do this, we will draw upon the French sociology concept of activism, which will allow us to analyze the profile of the young activists in both parties, the ways in which they get involved into them and the connection between their work and their militant careers. This approach also lets us recognize and analyze common elements in youth party participation beyond the aspects that make these activists so different, such as their history, their ideological positions and the ways in which they are internally organized. This article is part of a wider investigation on youth participation in political parties in Argentina, carried out by the Equipo de Estudios de Pol√≠ticas y Juventudes (IIGG-UBA). In this particular case, we recovered in-depth interviews to youth leaders and activists with different levels of responsibility inside each party, surveys applied with youth people from both parties, and participant observations on meetings defined by both parties as juvenile.

The introduction of the productivity gains model in the Brazilian agriculture has caused important changes in the rural environment, affecting its development. The agricultural sector in Paraná is part of this process and in this state, also, there have been significant shifts in the structure of production, which have had an indirect influence both economically and socially in the countryside. This essay, therefore, aims to measure the rural development rate in the cities of Paraná and identify the determining factors. The results have shown that, in a scale of 0 to 100, the average rural development rate is 43,63. 179 cities (44,86%) present rates above the mark mentioned and 220 (55,41%) are under this mark. By organizing the cities according to the development degree it was evident that more than half of the cities in the state have had low, very low or extremely low levels of rural development, a situation that calls for actions that aim to minimize the effects of the aspects which must be intensely worked on in order to improve life in the country and as a consequence, life in the city.

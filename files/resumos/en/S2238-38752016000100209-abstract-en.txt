Abstract Accordingly to the U. S. specialists and trade unionists, the Brazilian corporatist labor system was seen as a major obstacle to the development of the industrial relations in Brazil. This article aims to understand how the U. S. specialists in the 1960s critically portrayed the Brazilian corporatist as an inappropriate system. In order to understand the U. S. view, this study is based on the role of the AFL-CIO played in Brazil. Besides, this study analyzes the ideas of Brazilian labor specialists about the corporatism running in Brazil before the 1964 coup. Finally, this article presents the main features of the U. S. contractualism and Brazilian corporatism, according to the analysis of two U.S. labor lawyers. In this sense, this study aims to contribute to the scholarship that has challenged the monolithic understanding of the Brazilian corporatism.

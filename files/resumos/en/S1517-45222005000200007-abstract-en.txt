In Latin America, the study of social determinations of knowledge, or what we could call a sociology of ways of thinking, is not common. We can, without mistaking it, assume that such field is virtually unexplored. Life in our subcontinent develops at paces that are hardly captured by social investigation, and those responsible for producing knowledge stay behind really existing changes. The reasons are related to the loss of historical memory, the conservatism and academic haughtiness, which ignores or downplays knowledge produced by their colleagues in other parts of the region, in other times, or also in places that are distant from their own investigation centers. They are also related with the deadlines set for delivering results, but, most of all, to the dynamics of intense social experiences that university witnesses and participants are still reluctant to broadly collect in their studies. Our essay is aimed at evaluating the weight of predominant orientations, such as the perspectives of the construction of a critical thinking in contemporary Latin America. The exercise we carry out can be reproduced - if it is useful - in virtually every field of social knowledge, as long as it necessarily includes the task of producing knowledge tools that go beyond the perspectives established by a way of thinking tormented and suffocated by the pressure to be incorporated into the majority group of reproducers of what others have done.

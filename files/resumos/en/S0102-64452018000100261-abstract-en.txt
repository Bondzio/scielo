Abstract The aim of this article is to examine how the gradual involvement of the Inter-American Human Rights System (IAHRS) in South American transitional justice issues has contributed to shape institutional and normative parameters of the regional human rights system. It analyzes the main movements of the institutional trajectory of Inter-American bodies and the cases considered paradigmatic. The results indicate that, in the area of transitional justice, the Inter-American role presents a more innovative approach to the protection of human rights by raising expansive interpretations of the American Convention on Human Rights, a norm from which powers and competences originate, being conferred by the States members of the IAHRS.

Abstract This article offers an analytical framework on the emergence of sociology, and its institutionalization in the founding countries (Europe and the United States) and reproduction in Latin America. It focuses on the development of a research project on the process of institutionalization, disciplinary diversification and academic exchange of social sciences (Anthropology, Political Science and Sociology) in Brazil, seen through a Latin American perspective, in the period of 1930-2003.

Abstract: In this article, the evolution of my own research work becomes a narrative strategy for gaining insight into the multiple dimensions that may have been acquired over time by lesbian motherhoods as a subject of research. At the same time, this account seeks to review the changes that have taken place over the last ten years in the way lesbian motherhood is perceived in Spain, going from invisibility to legal recognition to the current broad spectrum of possibilities for accessing parenthood.

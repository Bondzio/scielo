Abstract The relationship between corruption and political participation in Brazil is investigated through analysis of patterns of association and permissiveness to the corruption of social profiles that combine categories of experience with corruption and political activism. Theoretical discussions and empirical analyzes are conducted using the 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2012 rounds of the Americas Barometer as a data source. The main results are the multidimensional nature of political participation, segmented into four different modalities. The positive and unequivocal association between experience with corruption and political engagement is also highlighted. Finally, a greater permissiveness to corruption (tolerance for the payment of bribes) is identified among individuals who have experience with corruption, regardless of whether or not this characteristic is accompanied by political activism.

In this study, we seek to identify and understand how sexuality has been treated in classroom practices at initial grades, considering that we see it as a historical and cultural construct. We examined female teachers' narratives about their classroom experiences involving sexuality, in order know discourses and strategies involved in the constitution of children's sexuality through the school pedagogies used by them. In the experiences narrated, we noted the emergence of the action and interrelationship of several discourses - those of biology; gender and sexual identities; the innocent and asexual child; family; protection , and of interdictions - for instance, the biological field explanations, students transfers, derogatory naming, reprehensions, micro punishments.

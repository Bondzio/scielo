This article presents some reflections about the feminist alternative press that appeared in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, in the second half of the 70's. The press was a space for expression of a special breed of politics that was closely linked to the awakening of women to feminist ideas in the period after the armed struggle against the Brazilian dictatorship. The journals Brasil Mulher and Nós Mulheres portray, in their articles and editorials, the fight for amnesty, for day nurseries, for democratic freedoms - all symbols of opposition against the regime in the era of military dictatorship. In addition they report on specific matters, such as, domestic violence, women's working-conditions, reproductive rights, abortion and sexuality. From the point of view of the popular movement and the women's organizations, the alternative press of women is without any doubt an important source, and still under-explored, for understanding the period considered.

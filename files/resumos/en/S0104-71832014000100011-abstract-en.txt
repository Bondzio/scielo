Through an ethnographic study conducted in one of the assistance programs of Cáritas Arquidiocesana de São Paulo, the Centro de Acolhida para Refugiados (CAR), this article aims to describe the network of relations established by the government apparatus of refugee populations in Brazil. Connected to organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the National Committee for Refugees and among other organizations, the work of CAR is part of a broader institutional device, which involves beyond humanitarian assistance, simultaneous actions of management and control pervade this population. Thus, I tried to understand how this apparatus puts into operation a mechanism of government - here called eye of the state - and how this produces a subject that will be understandable, from the analysis of the relationships established between the refugees and the various organizations they contact to request refuge: the "refugee camp without fences".

Amazon is integrated into the national economy so that capital takes advantage of trade asymmetries not loyal and unequal. The exploitation of resources is being more intense, degrading the environment and worsening social problems. The imposition of the capital established relations, although it transformed the family agricultural production, and have not eliminated it, and this presents different forms of production and different social relations. Starting from this premise, this paper sought to understand the production strategies that constitute the family agricultural production in Southwestern area of Pará. The study was carried out in three municipalities: Pacajá, Ancient Settlement area; Anapu, PDS (Sustainable Development Project) area; and Senador José Porfírio, the project area of Conventional Settlement of Incra (National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform). One hundred and fifty (150) families were researched during the 2007-2008 agricultural cycle. Qualitative parameters (observation in loco) and quantitative (statistical analysis) were used as methodological procedures, which can elucidate a mosaic (trajectories, perspectives and trends) that comprises the diversity of family agricultural production that results of the different materials bases in which families have to establish their medium and long-term projects.

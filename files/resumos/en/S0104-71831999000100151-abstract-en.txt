Abstract This paper &#8211; through the evaluation of a specific research-intervention project &#8211; aims at contributing to the discussion regarding citizenship and anthropological work. It points out the limits and the possibilities of an Applied Anthropology. Given the necessary critical content of the Anthropological discipline it seems to be easier to perceive the limits of the intervention work, however, this leaves us without possibility of verifying the actual efficacy of this kind of anthropological work-indeed the only one able to give a direct political contribution.

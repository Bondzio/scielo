Abstract: In this text critical theory is seen as having basically dissolved, incapable of analyzing and understanding the decadence or limitations of democracy all over the world (except in Latin America), as well as the new global, deeply unequal, configurations of contemporary capitalism. The recent developments of Frankfurt School tradition, the contributions and limitations of post-colonialism, the Marxist strands and Latin-American and Indian approaches are discussed. Social movements and possible paths of renewal of critical theory are also discussed.

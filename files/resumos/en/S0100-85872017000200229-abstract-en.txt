Abstract This article analyzes a wide controversy generated by the presentation to the House of Representatives of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in the beginning of 2015, of a bill put forward by an evangelical house representative and activist in defense of animal rights. The text takes up and updates the disputes and debates generated by a similar project presented ten years ago in the same state. Both projects have in common the fact that they were proposed by avowedly evangelical legislators and that they seek to ban the immolation of animals in African-riograndense religions. The article analyzes the rhetoric used by the social actors that advocate the project and by those who oppose it. This debate confronts not only different cosmological conceptions, but also different understandings of religious freedom in Brazil.

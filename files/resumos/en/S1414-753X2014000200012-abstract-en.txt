The aim of this article is to discuss sustainable development, more specifically in the process of institutionalization of environmental issues in Brazil. The relationship between the environment and the economy taken in the Federal Supreme Court due to the use of asbestos is analyzed. The analysis is based on the concept of rationality and its mediation between the environment and the economy. Among the results, it can be observed that when formalism is separated from reality concerning environmental issues, substantial discussions become difficult, and thus favouring economical interests and the dynamic capital, which are inherent to the economic racionality.

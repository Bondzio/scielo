ABSTRACT This article discusses the relationship between race, nationality and Abolition in the short stories of black intellectual Astolfo Marques (1876-1918) written to celebrate the end of Brazilian slavery on May 13 th, 1888. The investigation of these short stories, published in Maranh√£o in the first decade of the the 20th century, allows us to analyze the forms of social integration of blacks in modern Brazilian society through narratives constructed by black intellectuals after the Abolition in Brazil.

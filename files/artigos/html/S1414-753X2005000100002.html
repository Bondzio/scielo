Foi realizado um estudo comparativo envolvendo pa&iacute;ses com sistemas    pol&iacute;ticos e condi&ccedil;&atilde;os socioecon&ocirc;micas diferenciadas,    que propicia material para se refletir sobre a validade de se diferenciar quest&otilde;es    ambientais relacionadas a polui&ccedil;&atilde;o e uso de recursos.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><B>Palavras-chave:</B> uso de recursos naturais,    polui&ccedil;&atilde;o industrial, problemas ambientais, mudan&ccedil;a de valores.    </font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since the period of environmental activism and    policy debate that dates from around the end of the 1960s, the idea has been    firmly entrenched that pollution and resource depletion are complementary sources    of threat and anxiety. They are the pincers of environmental risk that threaten    industrial society on either side. If pollution does not get us, resource depletion    will. Such an idea was made explicit in the modelling commissioned for the 1972    Club of Rome report, for example, where the scenarios traded one form of threat    for the other.<a name="tx01"></a><a href="#nt01"><SUP>1</SUP></a> Even if we    did not imperil ourselves by running out of fossil fuels in the near future,    the burning of the fuels would create so much pollution that we would choke    ourselves to death. On this view, pollution and resource depletion are the export    and import ledgers of society's transactions with the natural world. Grave and    persistent problems with either aspect of the enterprise could prove disastrous.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the years that followed, this distinction    became a popular frame of reference for the discussion of environmental issues.    Scholars writing in the fields of geography, environmental science and environmental    policy reproduced the distinction and commonly organised their presentation    of environmental issues around it.<a name="tx02"></a><a href="#nt02"><SUP>2</SUP></a>    It was adopted by the policy community and by leading campaign organisations    and pressure groups who in their publicity documents commonly stressed the two-fold    nature of the threat using examples of industrial pollution and acid rain on    the one hand and the decline of fossil fuel reserves on the other. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In many respects, the classification made good    sense, especially as pollution problems managed to command centre stage for    activists and policy-makers. Pollution problems were easier to identify, to    take action on and to seek redress over, at least in the short term. Nonetheless    the threat of resource depletion lurked in the background, with a nagging worry    that it simply had to be the case that non-renewables (primarily energy resources)    would before long become scarce. The fear was that, at high and increasing rates    of usage, the scarcity might show itself only shortly before the resources finally    were depleted. As Dobson notes, environmental campaigners were fond of the analogy    with a plant that invades a pond; it doubles in size every day. It may take    many months to cover the pond entirely but if you wait until the pond is half    gone before taking action, you have only one day to act.<a name="tx03"></a><a href="#nt03"><SUP>3</SUP></a> In this climate of agreement there was felt to be no need to examine the    actual analytical value of the distinction itself or the political consequences    of continuing to take it for granted. But, as the potential significance of    environmental threats to developing countries and to the global commons became    more apparent and the focus for environmental problem-solving began to spread    beyond the industrial world, the relevance of this distinction to the conceptualisation    and analysis of environmental problems in the developing world or at the level    of the globe as a whole remained to be established. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The conceptual analysis in this paper was stimulated    by a project being undertaken by the Carnegie Council on Ethics and International    Affairs (CCEIA)<a name="tx04"></a><a href="#nt04"><SUP>4</SUP></a> that marks    one of the first systematic attempts to compare resource use and industrial    pollution cases across countries with varying political systems, levels of social    and economic development and complexes of cultural values. This commentary will    accordingly adopt a two-fold approach. It will draw upon the case studies to    make explicit cross-country comparisons regarding the politics of pollution    on the one hand and the management of conflicts surrounding natural resource    use. At the same time, the case-study material will be employed to examine the    theoretical and practical validity of the resource use and industrial pollution    categories themselves. In this manner it will shed light on the ways in which    policy practitioners and scholars categorise and approach environmental problems.    <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a> summarises the cases and clarifies the logic of    the CCEIA study. For each of four countries, two cases are identified: one representing    a problem with pollution, the other a problem over natural resource conservation.    The countries are further categorised into industrialising and industrialised    societies.</font></p>     <p><a name="tab01"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v8n1/a02tab01.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I begin with a brief discussion of alternative    ways that the literature has conceptualised and classified environmental problems.    I then move on to discuss the features of the pollution cases presented, pointing    to the diverse nature of the pollution problems and the need to look beyond    the common classification as simply "pollution problems." I follow this with    a comparable analysis of the resource use cases. In the final section I examine    the question of value change in relation to the two types of environmental problem    and take the opportunity to reflect again on the theoretical and practical validity    of the distinction that underlies the industrial pollution/resource use classification.    </font></p>     <p>&nbsp; </p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>ALTERNATIVES TYPOLOGIES</B> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The growth in scope and understanding of environmental    problems and their societal impacts - in part a consequence of greater involvement    of social scientists in addressing environmental problems and the consequent    birth of the field of environmental studies - has meant that at the start of    the twenty-first century the nature of the resource use and industrial pollution    distinction looks less clear-cut than it did when it first rose to public prominence    in the 1970s. For one thing there are environmental problems that seem to fit    the distinction only poorly if at all; it is unclear, for example, whether fears    over the release of genetically modified food crops or even genetically modified    farmed fish should be regarded as a form of pollution anxiety or a disquiet    about threats to a natural resource. Farmed salmon that escape captivity are,    in a sense, a form of genetic pollution since they threaten to inter-breed with    native fish and pollute the gene pool. However, they also have a direct impact    on the salmon fishery when thought of as a resource base since their inter-breeding    and competition with native fish will have an unpredictable effect on the natural    resource. Second, the forms of pollution that attracted most attention early    on were relatively simple and immediate in their effects: a noxious substance    was emitted that directly impacted local people's health or livelihood. By contrast,    with ozone-depleting substances and carbon dioxide emissions, concerns that    rose to prominence beginning in the 1980s, we are not worried about the gases    themselves being harmful. They do not contaminate the air we breathe; they change    the nature of the atmosphere so that, respectively, more high-energy radiation    is admitted and more heat energy stored. One could say they impact the atmosphere    as a resource rather more than polluting the air we breathe in a commonsense    manner. Accordingly, it is to some extent a mater of convention whether these    problems are assigned to one category or the other. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even more recent attempts to provide a single    definition for "pollution" that encompasses the human dimensions of    the issue have proved inadequate. For example, the British political scientist    Weale has defined pollution as: </font></p>     <blockquote>        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the introduction into the environment      of substances or emissions that either damage, or carry the risk of damaging,      human health or well?being, the built environment or the natural environment.      There is no implication in this definition that the substances involved stem      purely from human sources ... The assumption is simply that emissions or substances      introduced into the environment in quantities or concentrations greater than      those that can be coped with by the cleansing and recycling capacity of nature      constitute pollution.<a name="tx05"></a><a href="#nt05"><SUP>5</SUP></a> </font></p> </blockquote>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But here again the definition is insufficient    since ideas such as "the risk of damaging" and "within the ability    of natural cleansing capacity" fail to specify limits and are thus wide    open to interpretation. Moreover, the definition tends to presuppose that the    environment should not change. By this definition, oxygen was a pollutant, presumably    until life adapted to an oxygen-rich atmosphere. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Besides "resource use" and "industrial    pollution," there are other ordering devices for conceptualising environmental    problems that take into account social context, causes, and impacts. One well-known    distinction widely used in the environmental policy literature divides environmental    issues into three categories on the basis of the ease with which policy actions    can be taken.<a name="tx06"></a><a href="#nt06"><SUP>6</SUP></a> The first category    refers to mass environmental problems associated with heavy industry, vehicles    and power generation; an example would be sulphur dioxide emissions. Industrial    societies produce millions of tonnes of this gas; and attempts to regulate it,    while economically painful for many producers and their customers, are easy    to codify in legislation and reasonably straightforward to implement and monitor.    Varieties of fuel that are naturally low in contaminants can be used or regular    fuels can be treated before use; alternatively, various technical fixes can    be introduced to reduce the sulphur load carried by emissions. The second category    refers to environmental effects that are more numerous and widely geographically    dispersed, for example the myriad chemicals - solvents, cleaning fluids, lubricants,    wood preservatives and so on - associated with particular industries or manufacturing    processes. These problems are far more prevalent than the first kind and attempts    to prove beyond doubt that these substances or processes are dangerous have    often faced almost insurmountable difficulties. It is hard to isolate the substances    and to figure out their individual effects, let alone any synergistic reactions    into which they jointly entered. Industrial interests have fought tenacious    rear-guard actions to hang on to favoured chemical compounds. The third category    of problems is those that are supra-national, where the ability to regulate    the problem is not located exclusively within a single country or political    entity. Threats to world biodiversity or to the ozone layer fit this specification.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Policy analysts now typically argue that in retrospect    the first kind of problem succumbed to control with misleading ease, leading    to unattainable ambitions for environmental action with regard to the other    forms of problem.<a name="tx07"></a><a href="#nt07"><SUP>7</SUP></a> With the    identification of these new categories of problems, success in environmental    policy making has become decidedly patchy. In this view of the emerging environmental    problematic, industrial pollution/resource depletion may not be the key distinction    at all. Different instances of pollution can be expected to follow contrasting    paths if they represent differing positions on the three-tiered scale. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp; </p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>THE INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION CASES EXAMINED IN    THE STUDIES</B></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The comparative design of the Carnegie study    invites the reader to match the four pollution cases with each other in analysing    the dynamics of environmental conflicts; to do so is to take for granted that    the problems, qua pollution problems, are similar. However, the cases illustrate    that industrial pollution is not a single kind of problem. The Benxi and Delhi    cases concern air pollution, the Minamata case concerns water pollution, and    the Grand Bois case concerns toxic waste. But the differences are not just among    the forms of pollution (e.g., air, water, hazardous waste): there also significant    differences in terms of the social impacts of pollution. As noted above, it    is entirely possible to argue that there are important differences in policy    and political implications between different forms of pollution. Accordingly,    one key task is to assess the pollution problems presented in these case studies    in terms of their social and physical impact. I highlight how the four pollution    cases draw attention to the different social and political contexts in which    environmental problems can come to attention - in which they are "constructed"    as problems in the first place. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The well-known Japanese case of methyl mercury    poisoning in Minamata provides a very disturbing reminder of the shocking simplicity    of some pollution problems: residents ate poisoned fish caused by a local pollutant,    producing serious illness within the local population. The poisoning, a result    of the release of untreated effluent into an enclosed bay, was brought about    by a factory of the Chisso Company, a symbol of prosperity and hope for this    small, close-knit Japanese city in the 1950s. This case represents the primitive    logic of pollution, whereby the problem is visited on an area, region or community    by industrial activities carried on within that area. This outcome is distinct    from many other pollution cases, where pollution has nearly always been visited    on the poor by the wealthy. From the outset of industrialisation, in Great Britain    the westerly winds meant that affluent people tended to live at the western    side of cities. Minamata, on the other hand, is a case where the reproduction    of existing socio-economic inequalities in environmental terms was not universal;    certain forms of pollution can smooth out these differences. The poisoned Minamata    fish could affect rich and poor alike.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Though, in principle, it might have been easy    to identify the pollutant and to halt its dispersion early on, given the vested    interests of the Chisso Company and the government in keeping the plant running,    it took decades before the company, government and society at large acknowledged    the problem and found the company responsible. The local population suffered    doubly. The people, notably the Minamata fishing families who most relied on    a seafood-rich diet, bore the effects of mercury poisoning. They also suffered    the stigma their fellow unaffected Minamata area residents attached to the ensuing    illness itself both because of fear that the "strange disease" was    contagious and because by complaining about the problem and demanding compensation    from the Chisso corporation, the "patients," as they were known, were    imperilling the economic security of the city and thus the livelihood of other    Minamatans. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The United States has seen many cases of the    Minamata sort, where polluter and victim are part of the same community, all    across the industrial "rust belt," the old industrial area of the    northeast. But the Grand Bois case used in the Carnegie study, in which Exxon    disposed of its toxic oilfield waste cheaply in the near vicinity of this Houma    and Cajun community, represents something slightly different: a form of environmental    exploitation of the politically and economically disadvantaged. Though many    in this community benefited from jobs in the oil industry, unlike in Minamata,    the community suffered not from pollution produced by local industrial processes,    but from the importation of waste materials resulting from other people's industrial    employment elsewhere. In this sense, the Houma and Cajun had other people's    environmental problems imposed on them. Thus, though they are both instances    of relatively straightforward industrial pollution, subtle differences in the    relationship between polluters and victims distinguish Minamata and Grand Bois.    In Minamata, members of the local community faced a conflict of interest between    the retention of a reputable industry and the danger of its industrial practices.    In Grand Bois, a community is faced with the introduction of others' waste with    relatively little local pay-off. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here again the form of pollution also significantly    shaped the manner in which people were affected and responded. Whereas Minamata    represents the more classic case of a pollution industry denying that the industry    is causing harm, in Grand Bois the community became the victim of a federal    regulatory system that had seen fit to exempt oil-field waste from hazardous    waste regulation; contaminated water from drilling could therefore be officially    labelled simply as "brine" or "waste water." As the sociologist    Freudenburg has observed, industry puts a lot of effort into constructing environmental    issues as non-problematic.<a name="tx08"></a><a href="#nt08"><SUP>8</SUP></a>    In this case, industry interests were served not through the laborious process    of having to argue that exposure to oil field wastes was safe. Rather, the issue    of the balance of proof was finessed by the legal definition of the substances    being dumped. Furthermore, the play of environmental double standards is indicated    by the fact that the disputed storage facility was used for the disposal of    waste trucked in from Alabama; material that was too hazardous for people in    nearby states was introduced into this part of Louisiana.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> In Benxi and Delhi we see that a different form    of pollution - air pollution - stemming from multiple sources combines with    socio-economic and political circumstances to shape the political response.    In the Benxi case, the problem was constructed as a prominent issue within China    largely because of the international profile of the case. For rather circumstantial    reasons, Benxi had become a pollution celebrity city in China, known as the    city that was so shrouded in polluted air that it could not be seen 'from space'    (that is, by satellite). In contrast to Minamata and Grand Bois, although there    was widespread local acknowledgment that the air was bad, in their decision    to take action Benxi local officials attended to the harm relatively independently    of local people's experience. Their determination to take action was driven    also by the ambition of local officials who were happy to see their position    boosted by their involvement in an issue that was gaining in national importance    and by the possibility of funding and recognition from Beijing. Despite the    flurry of regulatory activity and the unprecedented influx of funds from Beijing,    Benxi residents who have seen rising unemployment since the introduction of    market reforms, questioned the priority placed on pollution remediation. Many    were sceptical about the city's motives for the policy measures - some of which,    like the greening of public spaces, they see as verging on arbitrary. That the    largest and most significant state-owned enterprise, Benxi Iron and Steel, was    given preferential treatment in the form of credit and other forms of assistance    to modernise its equipment together with the indictment of the company's top    management on bribery charges, and the massive layoffs from the company appear    to have fuelled this sense. Accordingly the willingness of experts to recognise    the problem does not win overwhelming public support for the official interpretation    of the environmental problems since officials' actions are viewed as suspect    and politically motivated. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Like Benxi, in Delhi the working class is cynical    about what they perceive to be the misplaced priorities of city officials and    influential environmental advocates. There is widespread frustration among the    workers towards the Supreme Court decision to promote pollution control that    benefits the wealthy and privileged few at the expense of the vulnerable working    class. The study indicates that of all the sources of Delhi pollution, the removal    of polluting industries was the first to be targeted because it fitted with    the health concerns of the urban middle classes. Their interest was assisted    by the campaigning zeal of legal advocates who opted to show the power of the    courts to get things done by sidestepping the political process and legally    impelling the relocation of industry. By forcing firms to relocate - which often    resulted in closure - Delhi's environmental campaigners were in practice destroying    the livelihood for many in the process of trying to clean the air. Ironically,    the overall impact on the health and well-being of the population caused by    these pollution-reduction measures together with the associated growth in unemployment    appears to be relatively minor given that vehicular, not industrial, pollution    is the major cause of Delhi's air pollution problems in the first place. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Collectively these cases in the Carnegie study    indicate the complexity of the category of "industrial pollution."    Though the study at one level is about the differential experience of pollution    in a variety of policy-making and socio-economic cultures, it is clear that    some of the differences between the cases arise from the different kinds of    pollution being analysed. Just as there are differences of culture, there are    differing forms of pollution: some pollution is more or less self-inflicted    while other pollution is imposed. Some pollution is locally identified while    in other cases the primary recognition of the pollution problem comes from outside.    And these differences do not map in any straightforward way on to the level    of industrial development of a particular country. For example, the forms of    environmental exploitation noted in Louisiana can occur cross-nationally or    within developing countries as well. Furthermore, the Delhi case emphasises    that the definition of pollution and of the most important kinds of pollution    can be subject to discordant interpretations within a single culture, notably    in this case between middle-class and trades-union representatives. The case-study    method serves well in detailing how the politics of pollution work out in particular    contexts but variations within the category of 'pollution problems' mean that    it is always a matter of skilled interpretative judgment to work out which aspects    of the case arise from the policy culture and which from the characteristics    of the pollution issue itself. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp; </p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>THE RESOURCE USE CASE STUDIES</B> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As argued above, the diverse forms of pollution    seen in the pollution cases force us to consider the impact of this variable    when comparing policy responses to the problem. By contrast, at first glance    the resource use cases appear to allow more easy comparisons since they share    a focus on water. Even so we see that the degree and nature of stakeholder dependence    upon the resource and the focus of the controversy varies across the cases in    ways that have an impact on the social and political dynamics. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The effort to protect the wetlands in the Sanjiang    Plain in north-eastern China is about water conceived in a rather holistic manner.    The conflict here is not strictly about the conservation of the water resource,    but about the wise use of a resource, a debate which ensued not on the ecological    merits of wetlands protection or even as a struggle between stakeholders at    the site. Instead, as in Benxi, the issue arose as a consequence of socio-economic    and normative changes occurring beyond the region, both nationally and internationally.    In the decades preceding the 1990s, in the national drive for food security,    the integrity of the ecosystem was compromised in pursuit of agricultural development.    As part of this effort and on the heels of the foray of "educated youths"    sent to the region to "conquer nature" during the Cultural Revolution,    peasant families were urged to relocate to the area. Furthermore the armed forces    had taken a leading role in shaping the area in the interests of maintaining    the border with the Russian Federation. Accordingly, resource protection came    to compete with other political objectives. With the government's new emphasis    on wetland protection, local farming and cultivation practices have come into    conflict with the regulations and have created resentment. The managers buy    official favour further up the political hierarchy by allowing high-ranking    officials to hunt in the area contrary to all the rules. Furthermore, there    is an important international dimension to the priority attached to the treatment    of this location as it was one of only six Ramsar sites (an international conservation    designation) in the country. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the Sonoran Desert case, the controversy is    not over whether to conserve water but how to conserve it, at what social and    economic cost, and to whom. As the plans for the Civano development proceeded,    resource conservation efforts became caught up with - some critics say, compromised    by - other considerations. For instance, the large-scale gathering and use of    rainwater, which was figured in to early housing designs precisely to equip    the houses for use in an arid zone, was subsequently ruled out on health and    sanitation grounds. In fact, some critics believe that the entire commitment    to environmental objectives in the project was compromised by the move to adopt    New Urbanism ideals of architectural and design-led community development that    competed with the ecological ideals. Indeed, the developers deliberately excised    environmental attributes from their promotional materials, reflecting the lower    priority they expected potential buyers would place on these considerations.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The cases of Kerala in India and Lake Biwa in    Japan bring to the fore another important dimension of resource use concerns:    conflicts over who has the right to regulate and control a resource, in the    Kerala case an in-shore fisheries resource and in the Lake Biwa, the water resource    itself. In Kerala, traditional fishers along the shores fought to retain their    way of life while finding ways to increase their productivity so as to generate    a growing surplus of fish to take to market. At the same time they were threatened    by the development of a trawler fishery further out to sea and by the arrival    of international fishing boats. Rather than experiencing the growth of yields    with the introduction of mechanisation, they faced declining catches, which    they attributed to over-fishing by trawlers, to trawlers fishing out of season,    and to the influence of factories and other land-based economic activities that    polluted coastal waters. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition to the central struggle over control    of the fisheries resource, fishers' representatives are sceptical about who    controls the very discourse of environmentalism. In particular, they take issue    with the way in which "international" environmental objectives have    been introduced through such measures as Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) on    shrimping nets. International regulations favouring the use of TEDs carry the    implication that there is only one acceptable way for turtles to be protected,    a way that involved the adoption of US-sanctioned devices. Alternative strategies    that might be less costly and more sensitive to local conditions, such as closing    the fisheries on the days that are critical to turtle reproduction, were not    permitted by international regulations. The international discourse of environmental    protection has thus been regarded with suspicion and seen as a cover for the    advancement of foreign commercial interests. The representatives argue that    ways of calculating what counts as "environmental protection" and    the "maintenance of the resource" were being taken out of the hands    of the locals and defined in ways that are not in their interests.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> At Lake Biwa, a growth of algal blooms alarmed    lakeshore residents, and in response to the perceived threat to the water resource,    the "anti-detergent" movement took off as a practical way for people    to take control of the protection of resources in their own environment, even    though this dealt with only one aspect of the lake's despoliation. The authors    of the Carnegie study describe how the movement represents a turning point for    Japan in terms of demands for greater public involvement in environmental decision    making: the residents of the area began seriously to question the national government's    invasive reach into local communities in the name of national development through    often costly and inappropriate public works. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The varying types of resource conflicts represented    by the case studies illustrate the complex character of water as a resource    to be sustained. The common element of water invites reflection on the tendency    to think of some resource issues solely in terms of conservation and depletion.    Calculations of the world's remaining fuel resources, for example, are often    couched only in terms of how much natural gas or oil is left. As the authors    of the Louisiana case note, oil production involves large-scale pollution, but    there is a temptation to abstract away from the messy business of winning oil    from the land or ocean to the more clinical business of working out the number    of million-barrels of oil remaining. By contrast, with water resources the intimate    connection between the safeguarding of the resource by the regulation of use    and the equally critical matter of protecting the <I>quality</I> of the resource    against contamination and pollution hazards is clearer. Water is - in principle    at least - a renewable resource and thus the quality of the reserve that is    recharged is as important as the monitoring of the usage. Consequently the fact    that these cases focus in large part on water means that the politics of resource    protection are closely allied to the politics of pollution, again indicating    the complications of the framing assumption about the separability of pollution    and resources problems. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus in the Lake Biwa case, the lake resource    was threatened with increased demand for water to feed a growing and affluent    downstream population, and with a loss of water quality driven by an increase    in residential, agricultural and industrial waste-water. Similarly, in the Sonoran    Desert case beyond the well-founded concerns about water scarcity, the preservation    of water <I>quality</I> is a significant issue in the region. Faced with a growing    demand for water, city authorities had to choose between further depleting the    aquifer source and piping in more water. Piped-in water was economically unattractive    and not popular with consumers. At the same time, the reliability of the aquifer    was especially tenuous because the less water that remained the harder it was    to pump; worse still there was the fear that pollution from the (growing) city    and surrounding areas would enter the aquifer and that the smaller the reserve    the greater the impact of any contamination. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this way these studies all indicate that resource    use, even when it is of the same medium (water), is complex and multi-faceted,    which complicates efforts to compare community responses. The politics of resource    protection may be about the conservation and wise use of a resource in a steady    state or about the protection of that resource from pollution in the wake of    socio-economic changes. Yet while there are differences in the kinds of threats    from which the water had to be protected, the study invites comparative analysis    of the diversity of ways of exercising and disputing "control" over    the resource. These variations in the character of the cases interact in complex    ways with the cultural and political contexts in which the resources were being    used, negotiated and protected. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp; </p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>VALUES AND VALUE CHANGE IN THE CASES OF INDUSTRIAL    POLLUTION AND OF RESOURCE USE</B> </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We now turn to the different dynamics of valuing    the environment in the industrial pollution examples and in resource use examples.    On the face of it, pollution would seem always to be a "bad," with    little disagreement about the need to curtail or lessen it. By contrast, resources    are "goods," where tensions derive from demands on the resource and    the requirement to avoid over-using it. Value orientations might thus be expected    to differ systematically across the two case types. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The case studies do not in fact clearly support    this hypothesis for several reasons. First, the influences on policy decisions    often extend well beyond the local actors; the cases show that, incentives to    act on both types of problems may be primarily external and not principally    driven by local people's values at all. For both Benxi and the Sanjiang Plain    one key aspect in the initial identification of the need for environmental action    was in response to external, international incentives and pressure and to the    internal political appeal of acceding to international requests. The conditions    were not wholly external; for example on the Sanjiang Plain, it was the attainment    of food security that also allowed China to shift its priorities. Still, a leading    consideration in both cases was related to China's desire to be acknowledged    as an upstanding member of the international community. Equally, in the Louisiana    case, the question turned centrally on the level of aggregation at which the    bads were to be assessed; seen in the context of the American South, there might    be some environmental benefit in concentrating the problem by dumping the waste    in one repository area, whereas from the host community's point of view the    bads appeared overwhelming </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second, as I have argued above, it is difficult    to circumscribe resource use and industrial pollution as wholly distinct categories    in the first place. In the Japanese, U.S., and Indian resource-depletion cases    the resource had to be protected from nearby people's own polluting activities,    from detergent and waste-water releases, from urban run-off and emissions into    ground water, and from industrial emissions into the ocean respectively. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Third, it appears that people do 'value' the    opportunity to pollute - to dispose of their waste products and so on - and    that, within limits, pollution is not invariably viewed as a 'bad'. Indeed,    in the Delhi pollution case the controversy turned on the correct identification    of the principal pollutants and the attribution of 'badness' to them. The competing    sides argued over whether the industrial pollutants or vehicular emissions were    the real problem and the argument was made that tolerable levels of pollution    from factories in practice allowed for the jobs that enabled the very survival    of many of the city's poor.</font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> A further important analytic possibility is    the interpretation of the cases in terms of the post-materialism thesis - the    idea that members of society generally attend to post-material values, such    as landscape value and habitat protection, only once material needs have been    met. According to this view, greater concern with environmental protection is    anticipated in wealthier societies. Of late this idea has been criticised on    the grounds that it makes environmental protection appear a "luxury"    good whereas certain forms of environmental harm have an incontestably material    content. In other words, in the context of the lives of citizens of developing    countries certain environmental protection measures (such as the provision of    clean water and the mitigation of air pollution) may be material rather than    post-material benefits. They have a direct interest in environmental improvement.    </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Carnegie case studies raise questions about    the power of the post-materialism thesis. In the pollution cases, action is    spurred by disclosures over the seriousness of the contamination, though whether    that concern then develops into a general orientation in favour of environmental    protection cannot be determined from these case studies. At the same time, we    can see that the way in which crises or other triggering events, which characterise    the pollution cases in particular (as with the contaminated fish in Minamata    or Benxi's invisibility from space) seem to stimulate environment-related activism    in these cases is subtly at odds with the generational changes anticipated by    post-materialism theory. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Furthermore, the post-materialism thesis is often    used to account for abstracted environmental concern, where people at the stage    of post materialism manifest consideration for environments with which they    have little or no direct connection. Yet in the Sanjiang case, for example,    the only local actors who support the wetlands reserve are the employees of    the Reserve bureau and sections of the People's Liberation Army who were detailed    to protect them. Thus the response appears to be fully material. And in the    Civano case, where we might expect to find post-material values, it is initially    instrumental values unrelated to nature (such as a desire for community), amenities    (such as feelings of space) and material interests (lower energy bills) that    attracted homebuyers to the development. Only after they move in and see what    is possible in terms of an environmentalist lifestyle do most of the residents    more fully embrace the larger significance of their actions. </font></p> <font size="2" face="Verdana">What we find, then, is that people assess environmental  issues in a more complex manner than the single hierarchy of post-materialism  would imply. The Carnegie studies make clear, albeit in different ways, that values  are heavily dependent on local context; this weakens the reliability of more generalised  value dispositions, such as those that might be picked up in surveys of post-material  attitudes. For example, in the two China cases, local perceptions that wetland  protection and pollution control involved corruption meant that the language of  environmental values could easily be viewed with distrust. Thus, residents of  Benxi and Fuyuan County similarly regarded official talk of environmental values  as hollow because each believed that officials' devotion to environmental goals  could be overridden by judicious bribes or other kinds of political favour; consequently  while people may value the environment, the expression of environmental value  by residents may be obscured by other considerations or expressed through those  other considerations. Contextual interpretations of value were important in a  different sense in the Minamata case where an innovative expression of value -  the notion of "Bringing Together the Sea and the Mountains" - was developed  as an explicit effort to restore trust between local people and the administrative  authorities. Thus, the make-up of the value complexes that are critical to the  outcome of local environmental problems are more nuanced and less uniform than  the post-materialism thesis envisages. This observation coincides with a finding  from a recent study of measures of "environmental concern," which found  that respondents' answers formed along "four dimensions dealing with trust,  responsibility, complexity, and economic trade-offs aspects of environmental problems  and protection".<a name="tx10"></a><a href="#nt10"><SUP>10</SUP></a> </font>        <p>&nbsp; </p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>RE-VISITING THE INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION/RESOURCE    USE DISTINCTION</B></font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Carnegie studies do more than allow us to    reflect on the industrial pollution/resource use divide since they provide comparative    information about pollution and natural resource politics across four different    contexts. However, an analysis of the distinction allows us to consider the    implication of different forms of environmental problems for political action    and outcomes. The four pollution cases differ in the form of pollution, in the    social distribution of responsibility for the pollutants, and in the politics    of the construction (or denial) of the pollution threat. In one sense these    differences complicate comparisons across political and policy cultures. Seen    another way, these differences allow the studies to elaborate how, in the shared    context of political mobilisation to protect the environment, the value basis    of the actions differs from one case to the other. It is unclear that a generalised    opposition to environmental harm becomes an established value in each case,    although this is most nearly the case in the Minamata example in part thanks    to deliberate attempts to foster normative innovations through the process of    <I>moyanaoishi</I> or social 'healing'. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Similarly in the analysis of the resource use    cases a key question is whether the value that is being introduced is in fact    an environmental one. One could take an exclusively economic and resource management-led    attitude towards water stocks, still wish to preserve them and even agree with    environmentalists about leading policy measures without explicitly adopting    the general values espoused by mainstream environmentalists. In Civano, for    example, objectives related to community values - of neighbourliness and so    on rank alongside (and occasionally trumped) environmental goals so that the    majority values in the community could readily conform to certain environmental-protection    orientations without themselves being explicitly environmentalist. This fact    echoes a larger dilemma identified in the environmental philosophy literature    where the question persistently arises: Is the institutionalisation of environmental    protection goals sufficient to deliver environmental sustainability? In other    words, the question persistently arises whether environmental <I>reforms</I>    of the sorts currently in place and proposed will be sufficient to bring about    the changes needed to maintain something like the natural environment we experience    today. Most commentators appear to think not<a name="tx11"></a><a href="#nt11"><SUP>11</SUP></a>    and these studies appear to support that position. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The studies therefore lead to further scepticism    regarding the accepted distinction between resource use and industrial pollution.    On the one hand, the categorisation tends to imply more homogeneity in each    category than is justified either in theory or practice. Pollution problems    may be relatively simple (with a single polluter emitting vast amounts of a    demonstrably harmful substance) or complex (with multiple emitters or small    amounts of substances whose harms are more contentious.) In a sense, the Delhi    case represents the clash between these two paradigms of pollution. These different    types of problem pose very different types of challenges to policy makers and    activists and tend to be associated with different types of political activity.    To classify them as the same phenomenon is thus only partially correct. At the    same time, many resources are also subject to despoliation through pollution    so that resource- and pollution-related anxieties may often be inseparable.    The dichotomy can thus be practically misleading. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Accordingly, other approaches to the categorisation    of environmental problems, such as the three-tiered classification introduced    at the start of this chapter, may need to be considered as well. The adoption    of that approach would lead us to view the Japanese and Chinese industrial pollution    cases as similar - because they deal with the mass production of chemically    straightforward pollutants - while the Indian case illustrates the complications    arising from attempts to regulate multi-sourced and interacting pollutants.    However, even this classification system breaks down because it is insufficiently    attentive to the social and economic dimensions of environmental problems. The    Louisiana oil industry case demonstrates that some environmental problems achieve    resonance and local political character from the sense that someone else's waste    is being imposed on a remote community. And the Delhi case reminds us that claims    about the responsibility for pollution may be interpreted by local actors along    class lines - as in this case - though also potentially in light of ethnic or    other socio-political differences. </font></p>     <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One final analytical insight from this study    arises directly from this point. As noted above, demands for environmental protection    are not in fact narrowly "environmental" as commonly understood. Some    sociologists claim that modern environmental concern is not so much a concern    about the external environment as an anxiety about a "humanised nature";    as Beck slightly gnomically puts it, "The ecological movement is not an    environmental movement but a social, inward movement which utilises 'nature'    as a parameter for certain questions".<a name="tx12"></a><a href="#nt12"><SUP>12</SUP></a>    For Beck and Giddens, environmental anxieties are more a response to the creeping,    unplanned and often unaccountable human intervention in the management of nature    - from genetic engineering to climate change - than about concern for the environment    per se. This plausible view is gaining in popularity, perhaps fuelled by the    undoubted unease that has greeted the spread of genetically engineered crops    and other examples of human domination over biological nature. What these studies    show by contrast is the opposite: that worries about aspects of the natural    environment often arise not from environmental concern but from something far    more ordinary - the avoidance of the loss of economic opportunities and jobs    or the manifest quality of life (as reflected in the availability of clean water).    Concern with the protection of resources is barely at all a concern about the    humanisation of nature more a part of figuring out how to get by in a fast-changing    world. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp; </p>     <p><font size="3" face="Verdana"><B>REFERENCES</B> </font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">BECK, U. <B>Ecological Politics in an Age of    Risk,</B> Cambridge: Polity, 1995. </font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&#160;<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="javascript: window.open('/scielo.php?script=sci_nlinks&ref=000079&pid=S1414-753X200500010000200001&lng=pt','','width=640,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=1,menubar=yes,');">Links</a>&#160;]<!-- end-ref --><!-- ref --><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">BLUNDEN, J. &amp; REDDISH, A.

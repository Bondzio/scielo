This article presents an extension of the work by Haddad and Teixeira (2014) in which they assessed the economic impacts of flooding in Sao Paulo considering a broader concept of economic loss, which includes not only traditional direct losses related to the interruption of production, but also the indirect costs associated with value chains. The overall results were decomposed enabling the identification of potential losses by specific flood points, expanding the scope of the analysis. With this new set of information, economic hotspots were identified, in other words, the points that may have caused the greatest potential economic losses to the city of SÃ£o Paulo and the country. Moreover, the decomposition technique used provides an auxiliary tool for cost-benefit analysis of local projects to reduce flooding.

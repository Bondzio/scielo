This article will discuss the historical-dialectical perspective of the methodological proposal of the Nuclei of Meanings and its outcomes as a methodological choice. The proposal and its development as a methodological choice to be followed will be discussed, seeking to achieve the necessary consistency between method and procedures. Initially, each of the stages of this proposal is presented. Then, the historical-dialectical perspective of the method that underlies the involved procedures will be discussed. To do this, some considerations are drawn, particularly with respect to the movement of the analysis. It is expected that this paper will contribute to the academic debate both from the point of view of the historical-dialectical method and also to the process of analysis and interpretation of the senses and meanings.

Abstract Traditionally, sociological literature makes a clear distinction between approaches in the analysis of higher education and the changes it has been experiencing in recent decades, and approaches in the analysis of the social facts related to science, including its institutionality. However, science and academia occupy the same institutional space: although scientific research can be organized in other social spaces, it is undeniable that, the academic environment is worldwide the privileged space for the collective organization of science. The central question of the work, therefore, is to investigate the interaction between changes experienced in university governance, recent changes in the mode of knowledge production, and new models of science governance. Following, the analysis focuses on the dilemmas created by the dynamics of these new realities for the Brazilian experience, focusing particularly on recent developments of the institutional apparatus for coordination of science and university in Brazil.

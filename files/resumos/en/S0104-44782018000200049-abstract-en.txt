ABSTRACT  Introduction This article analyzes narratives of young graduates of the Brazilian Young Parliament (BYP), an initiative of parliamentary simulation promoted annually, since 2004, by the Brazilian House of Representatives. The text focuses on the following question: how do young people evaluate the impacts of the BYP in their political education? Some of the differentials of the studies already presented on this subject stand out because it is a qualitative study, with an emphasis on the voice of the youth themselves; it refers to a longer period, comprising ten years; it has as its object the federal legislature and addresses a wider range of issues, beyond political trust.  Methods The survey was conducted in 2014 using an online questionnaire sent to 763 participants in 10 editions (2004-2013) and received 173 answers (22.67%).  Results The results show that besides the political formation provided by the parliamentary simulation, the participants indicate other formative aspects, such as the development of their analytical skills and a better comprehension of politics and legislative activity.  Discussion The article highlights the relevance of political education, considered as a basis for the construction of a civic culture capable of supporting democratic regimes. The study seeks to contribute to this discussion based on the effects of BYP.

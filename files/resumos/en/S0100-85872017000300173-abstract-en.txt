Abstract By means of ethnographic research, the present study registers the native concept of mediumistic phenomenon as transmission of vibrations between the intangible beings and the incarnated people. First, I present the quantic notion of vibration by which people explain the concept of the seven bodies of the person. After, I argue that the technique of mediumistic process, through which people embody and materialize the sacred, also make them transform themselves into media. The theoretical relevance of this formulation to the study of materiality in mediumistic religions is highlighted insofar as the medium-person becomes mediumistic device and technological instrument. Finally, the article concludes that the conception of &#8220;incorporation&#8221; inside this umbandista theory is distinctly different from the connotation of the word.

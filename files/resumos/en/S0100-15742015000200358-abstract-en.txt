This chapter intends to investigate the extent to which the theory of social representations may define and explain the processes of learning and instruction. The phenomena of learning and instruction have hitherto mostly been investigated and explained from the psychological theories of development and cognition. We believe that less attention has been devoted to the explanation of human learning and instruction from, for example, ethnographic, sociological or socio-psychological analysis. In this chapter, we intend to reflect upon the role that can be played by the theory of social representations, particularly the phenomena of subjectivity and intersubjectivity in the formation of the processes of human learning and instruction.

ABSTRACT The goal of this article is to return to some ill-explored classical themes, central in the past of sociology or of those that the discipline incorporated as its founding fathers and that have today been abandoned. The multidimensionality of social life and the trends of development which, particularly in modernity, drove it are discussed. Theoretically these subjects (supposedly) remain decisive, equally from the standpoint of social practice. Ultimately, readdressing them allows us, to a certain extent, to suggest a vision of humanity that is more complex, less ethnocentric, regarding its more directly social aspects and, as a result, more accurately situate the differential characteristics of modernity itself.

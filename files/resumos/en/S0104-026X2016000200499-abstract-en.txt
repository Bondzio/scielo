Abstract: The article approaches the professional history of some women who lectured Anthropology in Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais as from the 1960s, to discuss that their position as a professor in an intellectual environment, on the way to specialization led to their exclusion or marginalization in the local and national scenario. The article discusses the situation of women who are left out of the prestigious circuits of Anthropology in Brazil, as the situation of Anthropology in Minas Gerais can also be deemed as peripheral when compared to other Social Sciences and to other education and research Anthropology centers. So, I propose that the history of the discipline should comprehend men's and women's "outside" careers, in terms of the processes of differentiation based on aspects of gender, social class and modes of professional qualification.

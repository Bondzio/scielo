The paper points out the importance of understanding children´s constructions in the context of social relations that are produced and updated in everyday interactions. In this regard we will analyse the different (methodological and conceptual) contributions of anthropology and psychogenetic theory to the research of children´s social knowledge. We will argue that it is possible to build an approach that links both disciplinary fields. We will review the core characteristics of the clinical critical method and ethnography with the aim of stressing their potencialities as well as their limitations for the research. Furthermore we will argue that this method must be resignified within the basic premises of social anthropology.

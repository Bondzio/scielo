Clara Zetkin suggested the creation of the International Women's Day during the 2nd Socialist Women's International Conference in 1910. After 1970 this date became increasingly associated with a fire that took place in New York City in 1911. In this paper I review the history of the 8th of March, pointing out some of the distortions of its meanings and the repercussions these distortions have had for an understanding of feminist struggles.

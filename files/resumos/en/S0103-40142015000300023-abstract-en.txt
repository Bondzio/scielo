abstract Analysis of a poem from Livro de sonetos, published in 1949 by Jorge de Lima. Beginning with a "close reading of the text," the reflection becomes a comparative practice, confronting the poem with a passage from the 1939 novel A mulher obscura. Finally, it focuses on the love found in both texts, highlighting the love for the sonnet form and the love for "woman who delivers herself unto death" - an image that, with evident fin-de-si√®cle traces, is finely imprinted by the author from Alagoas.

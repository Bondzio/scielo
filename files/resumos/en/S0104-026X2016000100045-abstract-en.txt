Abstract: The article presents an anthropological study of members of mutual aid groups "Women who love too much anonymous", based in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The interviewees have a heterogeneous social profile; declared themselves heterosexual; and focus on the age group between 40 and 50 years. The narratives indicated: intense dedication to the relationship; the need to control the partner; fear of loneliness; and sense of "low self-esteem". Marital interaction is characterized by competition and conflict over reciprocal attention and care. These women seem to update a model of traditional female behavior, despite their familiarity with the egalitarian conjugal proposal.

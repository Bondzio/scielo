Abstract The article shows a conceptual tool for observing the State&#8217;s historic action in Brazil. This concept is based on the analysis of the State&#8217;s capacity to define territories and actions through its institutional discourse, which has a power of legitimation. In this way, the text demonstrates that the social sciences need to collect the injunctions between public narrative and the &#8220;means of production in definition&#8221; which are made in State&#8217;s speech. The analytic thought of modernity is the theoretical basis of this study. By means of a historical and theoretical synthesis of Lula&#8217;s government and its developmental discourse, the paper explains that ideas about region and development are parts of a genealogy of classification ways produced by the Public Machine. Thinking about these elements means to guide analysis tools in political sociology.

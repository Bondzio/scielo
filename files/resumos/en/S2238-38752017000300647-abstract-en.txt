Abstract The interview, conducted via an exchange of e-mails, explores Joel Robbins&#8217; contributions to the reappraisal and resurgence of Louis Dumont&#8217;s work in contemporary anthropology. Starting from the central concept of &#8220;value&#8221;, the concept of relationism proposed by Robbins is explored as the counterpart of Dumont&#8217;s holism versus individualism dualism, as well as the unfolding of these notions in an anthropology of Christianity exemplified by Robbins&#8217; research in Melanesia.

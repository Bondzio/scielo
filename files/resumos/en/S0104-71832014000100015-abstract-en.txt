The seminar "Les sentiers de l'ethnologie urbaine, avec Colette Pétonnet" (Pathways of urban ethnology, with Colette Petonnet), held on October 3-4, 2013 at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, brought together diverse researchers in a posthumous homage to this precursor of ethnology in urban settings and founder - together with Jacques Gutwirth - of the Laboratoire d'Anthropologie Urbaine do Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (LAU/CNRS). This article is inspired in the contribution solicited from Claudia Fonseca (one of Colette's former students), presented at the seminar in the form of a video produced in co-authorship with Claudia Turra Magni and Mauro Bruschi, entitled Colette Pétonnet au Brésil: les effets pédagogiques d'un exercice ethnographique. Here, the authors outline the repercussions of the teachings of Colette, starting with her sojourn in Porto Alegre during the early 1990s.

The balance of academic production on gender and work in Sociology reveals the enormous relevance of studies and research for the understanding of gender relations in society. Without intending to be exhaustive, this article focuses on works that well illustrate what we consider to be the three main contributions of this production, namely: giving visibility to the female presence in the labor market in different occupations; raising the discussion on sexual division of labor and relationship with productive/reproductive spaces and professional work/domestic work; and reflecting on the implications of changes due to globalization and productive restructuring of the ways that women are included in the labour market and in family life.

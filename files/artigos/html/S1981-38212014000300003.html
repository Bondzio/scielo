<div id="article-body" class="body">
<p>The origin and formation of the social sciences in Brazil has been the object of deep and
			rigorous investigations that have brought to light the conditions that marked the work
			of the founding fathers of social and political thought in Brazil. In this regard, <sup><a href="#B18">Miceli (1995)</a></sup> emphasises the importance of the
			creation of academic institutions in São Paulo for the autonomy of the pioneering
			generations of social scientists, in contrast with the smaller differentiation between
			social scientists and the political elites of Brazil's other states. <sup><a href="#B11">Forjaz (1997)</a></sup> highlights the role played in the
			genesis of Political Science in Brazil by a generation established in Rio de Janeiro and
			Minas Gerais. <sup><a href="#B27">Trindade (2007</a></sup>; 2012) renders this
			scenario more complex with his more nuanced diagnosis, revealing the great regional
			diversity in the processes of formation of the social sciences in Brazil, as well as the
			importance that international circulation had for professionalising researchers and for
			the constitution of groups geared towards academic research in different institutional
			and regional contexts. In addition, <sup><a href="#B15">Lamounier
				(1982)</a></sup> identifies the two bases that constituted Political Science in Brazil:
			a tradition of political thought forged between the 1920s and 1960s and the
			professionalisation that came as a result of the expansion of the academic system in the
			1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is not to revisit the founding elements of the social sciences in
			Brazil – a process that has been well documented and analytically unravelled –, but to
			explore its inflexion, starting from its gradual institutionalisation, particularly
			after the end of the 1960s. Our intention is to isolate the main expression of this
			process of institutionalisation – the expansion of the postgraduate system, which
			brought research and scientific reflection into institutions focused on training masters
			and doctors and strongly oriented by an assessment model based on peer judgement and the
			rating of scientific production. The focus here is on Political Science in comparison
			with its neighbouring disciplines, Sociology and Anthropology. We attempt to consider
			the timing of the process of academic institutionalisation of Political Science, as well
			as its consequences for the consolidation of the field nowadays. In the first section,
			we attempt to retrace the sequence of institutionalisation in the three fields based on
			an examination of how PhD courses and the training of doctors in Political Science,
			Sociology and Anthropology were formed. In the second section, we map the Political
			Science postgraduate programmes – considering the areas and thematic lines present in
			institutions currently in existence –, as a procedure for assessing their concentration
			(or diversity) and expansion, as well as the consolidation of a model for evaluating
			scientific production. Lastly, the text deals with the international impact of the
			scientific production by the Brazilian Political Science community. The information on
			the postgraduate programmes was extracted from the database of the Coordenação de
			Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (Capes – Brazilian Federal Agency for the
			Improvement of Higher Education)<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>, which, in its turn, is updated every year by the
			Capes Report, containing information presented by the programmes on their activities
			during that period. Any discrepancies between the information made available by Capes,
			the postgraduate programmes and those published in the Lattes Platform (CV database) are
			attributable to the information provided by the programmes. In order to maintain
			standardisation, unless otherwise stated, the data from Capes were utilised – the same
			ones that are used for assessing Brazil's postgraduate system.</p>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp46432"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">The institutionalisation of Political Science in Brazil: slow but sure</p>
<p>To Bulcourf and Vasquez (2004), the institutionalisation of an academic discipline is
				identified when it differentiates itself from other fields and academic disciplines,
				producing its own professional skills. As a result of the conformation of a specific
				professional community, the constitution of shared criteria of professional
				evaluation and recruitment, followed by the appearance of scientific associations,
				should be expected. In this sense, shared parameters for assessing merit and
				academic organisations seem to be the main symptoms of a discipline's
				institutionalisation.</p>
<p>Of a similar ilk is the demarcation suggested by Pérez-Linãn (2010), for whom high
				institutionalisation can be recognised by regular, peer reviewed academic
				publications, professional recognition based on productivity – rather than on
				teaching or positions assumed in public debate –, low endogeny, high qualification
				requirements for entering a post and exclusive dedication in order to keep it.
				Conversely, low or precarious institutionalisation is recognisable when the
				profession is poorly structured, there is no requirement for exclusive dedication to
				a post, the academic training is in neighbouring disciplines such as Law, History or
				Sociology, publications are intermittent and there is no peer-review system,
				criteria of professional recognition are based on belonging to the "right" circles,
				there is dilettantism and low specialisation as seen in a wide range of teaching
				activities and research projects, and a tendency for an essayistic treatment of
				objects rather than a search for and treatment of empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Finally, <sup><a href="#B16">Leite and Codato (2013)</a></sup> associate
				institutionalisation with discipline autonomy by distinguishing the two dimensions
				through which this autonomy operates: firstly, (i) an <em>institutional</em>
				autonomy, marked by an expansion of the postgraduate system through Master's and
				Doctoral programmes, a rise in "disciplinary" periodicals (as opposed to more
				general ones) and the creation of scientific associations, such as in the case of
				the Associação Brasileira de Ciência Política (ABCP – Brazilian Association of
				Political Science). Parallel to that, (ii) a
					<em>theoretical-methodological</em> autonomy, entailing a "development
				of theories, methods and approaches that are particular to it", or, in other words,
				"that deal with politics as a self-regulating universe", making it "irreducible to
				other disciplines" (<sup><a href="#B16">LEITE and CODATO, 2013,
				p</a></sup>, p. 01).</p>
<p>Using these notions as a parameter, here we consider disciplinary
				institutionalisation as a process resulting from two factors: (i) an expansion of
				the indicators of <em>professionalisation</em>, involving the material bases
				necessary for academic activity and training professionals involved in research at
				universities and professional associations, creating a distance from dilettante
				amateurism; (ii) the consolidation of an institutional assessment system based on
				peer judgement, as a criterion for constituting academic hierarchies and allocating
				resources and incentives to academic and research activity.</p>
<p>The main driving force behind this process of institutionalisation of Brazilian
				Political Science has probably been the assessment of the postgraduate system
				carried out by Capes since 1976, which considers two aspects: 1) the accreditation
				of new courses and (2) a triennial evaluation of the performance of all institutions
				that make up the postgraduate system.</p>
<p>Two criticisms have been made of the inductive effect on the institutionalisation of
				the Brazilian postgraduate system caused by the Capes assessment. The first is that
				the rules of the institutional assessment might be an incentive to "productivism".
				By prioritising quantitative indicators, such as the number of published articles,
				citations or impact factor, the Capes institutional assessment could end up
				encouraging quantity of scientific production over quality or originality, as well
				as the use of subterfuges in order to artificially increase these indicators – such
				as self-citation, cross referencing or replicating the same piece (<sup><a href="#B4">BIANCHI, 2014</a></sup>). A second criticism points out
				that academic institutionalisation could go hand in hand with a reduction in the
				creation of relevant knowledge and a homogenisation of scientific production. As it
				stimulates quantity and prioritises the publication of papers in scientific journals
				over books, the result could be a disciplinary institutionalisation that produces
				ultra-specialised results of limited scope, to the detriment of long-term research
				and the construction of "great theories" and inclusive explanations (<sup><a href="#B5">BRANDÃO, 2007)</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A significant part of these criticisms can be attributed to a lack of information
				about the parameters traditionally employed in the process of academic assessment
				responsible for disciplinary institutionalisation. If "institutionalisation" can be
				understood as the constitution of a field with its own rules, values and
				hierarchies, the institutionalisation of Political Science as a discipline means
				that the values that determine its recognition and professional status do not result
				from the approval of entities such as "public opinion" (in the shape of social
				popularity) or from a deference typical of other social categories – such as Law,
				Journalism or Literature and their valuing of rhetoric, proselytism or essayism.
				Rather, they derive from codes and parameters pertaining to a treatment of "politics
				as science" (<sup><a href="#B3">BARRY, 1996</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B22">SARTORI, 1984</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B24">SKINNER, 1978</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B28">VON BEYME,
				1996)</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Contrary to what the critics say, it is precisely quality that the institutional
				assessment of the postgraduate system values, minimising the importance of the
				quantity of scientific production. This is evident in the creation of the Qualis
				system, responsible for rating the quality of scientific publications based on
				criteria pertaining to each field of study, but with peer recognition in common.
				Peer recognition is expressed by the impact factor, calculated by the number of
				citations (that is, the importance that academic peers attribute to a certain
				author's contribution), the rigour and selectivity in the peer review procedures
				adopted by each periodical for accepting articles, or even more subjective criteria
				such as the importance attributed to a journal in a certain disciplinary field. For
				evaluating the institutional performance of Brazilian postgraduate degrees, the
				production of few articles published in periodicals classified as being in the upper
				categories of the Qualis system (and therefore with a greater potential for
				citation, rigour in accepting work or recognition in the disciplinary community) is
				more valued than a great quantity published in periodicals classified as being in
				the lower categories. In this way, quality – gauged by different procedures for
				measuring the judgement and recognition of peers – takes unequivocal precedence over
				the amount of scientific publications in the academic assessment and
					institutionalisation<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The assumption that greater academic institutionalisation should go hand in hand with
				theoretical and methodological homogenisation seems equally devoid of evidence.
				Based on a comparison between journals ranked in the upper Qualis/Capes categories
				and between different analytical schools and thematic areas, <sup><a href="#B16">Leite and Codato (2013)</a></sup> concluded that:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have three extremes. In one of them, there is Lua Nova, closer to political
					theory, concept analysis and history of ideas (TP-HI). In another, Opinião
					Pública, closer to values, attitudes, participation and politics (VAP-P). In the
					last one, the Brazilian Political Science Review, closer to the performance of
					political institutions (DIP). In addition, there seem to be two other clear
					positions: Dados also shows a pull towards DIP, and the Revista de Sociologia e
					Política and the Revista Brasileira de Ciências Sociais (to a lesser degree) are
					closer to the State, society and government policies area
						(ES-PG)<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>. These two periodical make up the centre
						(<sup><a href="#B16">LEITE and CODATO, 2013</a></sup>, p.19).</p></blockquote>
<p>The scenario presented by <sup><a href="#B16">Leite and Codato
					(2013)</a></sup> suggests that institutionalisation and theoretical and
				methodological pluralism co-exist side by side. That is, the creation of a values
				hierarchy for the scientific periodicals of the area of Political Science did not
				signify the hegemony of one analytical school, but, on the contrary, ensured that
				there was space in the higher classification categories for publications of a
				neo-institutionalist, behaviourist, political sociology, normative theory or Marxist
				nature, among others.</p>
<p>Finally, a relevant question regarding "productivism" is the importance attributed by
				the institutional assessment to the process of internationalisation of scientific
				production. Here, the question directly concerns the parameters of quality expected
				from activities of knowledge production and academic research. Indicators that the
				expected requirements of quality, as well as of originality, relevance and
				creativity were attained can be identified when the results of academic research
				have repercussions, are recognised and used in the form of citations – not only
				within Brazil's disciplinary community, but increasingly among international
				peers.</p>
<p>The second question concerns the relationship between institutionalisation and the
				production of specialised knowledge and knowledge of "medium reach", in contrast
				with the great interpretative models by the previous generation of Brazilian "social
				thought".</p>
<p>Arguing in favour of a progressive/cumulative interpretation of the history of
				Political Science, <sup><a href="#B1">Almond (1996</a></sup>, p. 51)
				suggests that the development of notions such as "justice" and "democracy" could not
				have happened without the contributions of Plato and Aristotle. However, he recalls
				that today's knowledge of theories of justice cannot fail to consider the refinement
				and rigour included in treatments such as those by Walzer and Rawls, in the same way
				that Dahl and the neo-institutionalists furthered our knowledge on the "nuts and
				bolts" of today's democratic institutions. In this sense, it seems pointless to
				stretch the gap between the generation of the "interpreters" and that of the
				"professionals", centred on an institutionalised postgraduate system. If a concept
				such as "bureaucratic stratum" was vital to bring the State back into the focus of
				analyses on Brazil's social and political formation, recent contributions from
				postgraduate laboratories allowed knowledge on how Brazil is governed to be
				furthered, thus generating important information on intergovernmental relations, the
				makeup of governmental bureaucracies, the formation of public policy agendas,
				federalism, the voting decision and party organisation. In the light of criticisms
				such as those outlined by <sup><a href="#B7">Carvalho (1980</a></sup>,
				p.38) and <sup><a href="#B23">Schwartzman (1982, p</a></sup>, p. 60) of the
				notion of "bureaucratic stratum", would it be credible to state that the knowledge
				generated in the last four decades of institutionalised postgraduate programmes has
				added little to an understanding of the agents and mechanisms that configure the
				institutional dynamics of Brazilian politics?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp88240"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Professionalisation and institutional spaces for research</p>
<p>An initial step for analysing disciplinary institutionalisation is to consider the
				chronological differences between the founding of different scientific associations.
				In Political Science, the establishing of scientific associations is part of a
				trajectory of growing disciplinary specialisation and autonomy, with a demarcation
				of the field in relation to Philosophy, Law and, later, Sociology (<sup><a href="#B1">ALMOND, 1996</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B8">DOGAN, 1996</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B12">GOODIN, 2009</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B13">GOODIN and KLINGEMANN, 1996</a></sup>). Thus, outside of
				Brazil, there was no time lag between the creation of Political Science associations
				and those of the other traditional areas of the social sciences. In the United
				States, the founding of the American Anthropological Association (1902), the
				American Political Science Association (1903) and, shortly after, the American
				Sociological Association (1905) was virtually simultaneous. In France, even in a
				context of slow dissociation between Political Science and Sociology (<sup><a href="#B10">FAVRE, 1985</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B9">FAVRE and LEGAVRE, 1998</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B14">GRAWITZ and
					LECA, 1985</a></sup>), the Association Française de Science Politique was created
				as early as 1949, before the Societé Française de Sociologie (1962) and its
				successor, the Association Française de Sociologie, created only in 2002. Although
				the founding of the Sociedad Argentina de Análisis Político in 1982 was late
				compared to that of the Sociedad Argentina de Antropología (1936), it still happened
				much earlier than that of the Asociación Argentina de Sociología, whose creation
				dates only from 2009<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>. In Chile, the Asociación Chilena de Ciencia
				Política originated in 1966, with a hiatus after the authoritarian regime was
				implemented, resuming in 1983. In contrast, the 8<sup>th</sup> Chilean Sociology
				Congress, in 2014, was held by the Sociology Network of Chilean Universities (Red de
				Sociología de las Universidades Chilenas), given the lack of a professional
				association for the discipline. As for the international associations of these
				disciplines, there was some synchrony between them: both the International Political
				Science Association (IPSA) and the International Sociological Association (ISA) were
				created in 1949.</p>
<p>Rather suggestively, there was a hiatus in Brazil that separated, on one side, the
				founding of the Sociology and Anthropology associations and, on the other, those of
				political scientists. While the Sociedade Brasileira de Sociologia was created in
				1948, holding its first congress six years later, in 1954, and the Associação
				Brasileira de Antropologia dates from 1955, having held its first congress two years
				previously, three decades elapsed before the Associação Brasileira de Ciência
				Política came into existence in 1986, and yet another decade before it held its
				first congress in 1996, on the premises of Cândido Mendes University.</p>
<p>Although scientific associations are important for constituting a disciplinary
				community and setting common research agendas, the strongest driving force for the
				professionalisation of academic work is probably the expansion of academic
				institutions, which is also a platform for the institutionalisation of each area of
				knowledge. Assessment systems, researcher training, professional recruitment and
				infrastructure for scientific research are some of the by-products of the academic
				system, responsible for promoting treatment models for political objects different
				from the essayism and dilettantism seen in political commentators, journalists,
				jurists, etc. One of the paradoxes of the Brazilian authoritarian regime was that
				not only did it not destroy higher education as the military did in countries such
				as Argentina but, on the contrary, it expanded it, especially the postgraduate
				system and agencies of scientific and technological development (<sup><a href="#B27">TRINDADE, 2007</a></sup>). However, Political Science
				arrived late at Brazilian universities. According to a survey carried out by Tavares
				de Almeida (2005), by 2003 there were only five Political Science undergraduate
				courses in the country, compared to a total of 64 Social Sciences and 43
				International Relations courses in the same year. Although social sciences courses
				are usually a sort of a cluster of Anthropology, Political Science and Sociology,
				the same study by Tavares de Almeida revealed that the presence of Political Science
				in this context is a rather modest one: in 39% of the Social Sciences bachelor's
				degrees there was not a single Political Science subject. 44% had up to eight
				subjects, and only in 17% of them did Tavares de Almeida identify a more significant
				presence, with an offer of more than eight subjects.</p>
<p>There have been significant changes in the last decade – especially after the Reuni
				Programme of expansion of federal universities –, with an increase in the number of
				International Relations undergraduate courses, and more recently, Public Policy
				courses (<sup><a href="#B21">PIRES et al., 2014</a></sup>). USP, UFRGS and
				UFABC were some of the higher education institutions that started offering these
				undergraduate degrees. According to the Higher Education Census, in 2011 there were
				179 undergraduate courses aimed at training students in Public Management or Public
				Policy. Out of all of them, 82 (46%) were in Public Management, 46 (26%) were in
				Public Administration, 16 (9%) were in Public Security Management, 15 (8%) in the
				area of Health, 13 (7%) in the area of Social Management, 5 (3%) in Public Policy
				Management and two (1%) in Public Policy. Out of the total number of courses, 101
				(56%) were technical and 67 (37%) were bachelor's degrees, with 105 (59%) created in
				the last year. Although this scenario has shown some improvement in the last decade,
				in a great many number of cases these degrees were led by professionals from areas
				such as History, Law and Business Management, reproducing the marginal presence of
				political scientists in the training of human resources in Brazilian
				universities.</p>
<p>A more nuanced panorama of the development of Political Science in Brazil can be seen
				when we shift the focus of observation to postgraduate programmes. The dynamics of
				postgraduate courses is a more adequate measure of the behaviour of scientific
				communities, whether because (a) at this level, the processes of specialisation and
				differentiation have been previously set off by the creation of programmes from each
				one of the social sciences areas; (b) because of their very nature, which is more
				closely linked to scientific investigation and the training of researchers, or
				lastly; (c) because the causality between the expansion of undergraduate and
				postgraduate degrees does not necessarily mean that a rise in undergraduate degrees
				is a condition for a rise in demand for MA and PhD courses, but rather, the offer
				generated by the training of masters, and especially doctors, feeds a demand for
				professional inclusion from the centre to the periphery of the system, pressing for
				greater differentiation, specialisation and the creation of new postgraduate
				programmes.</p>
<p>Political Science postgraduate degrees in Brazil had their founding moment in 1969,
				with the creation of the Master's in Political Science at UFMG<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup> and Political Science
				and Sociology at the former IUPERJ. Following that, an MA was created at UFRGS
				(1973). In the following year, an MA and the first PhD in Political Science in the
				country were created at the University of São Paulo, as well as an MA at Unicamp.
				However, the rate of creation of postgraduate courses was slow and the second
				doctorate (IUPERJ) only began in 1980. Another 16 years passed before the creation
				of a third one at UFRGS in 1996. 30 years after the "inauguration" of the Political
				Science postgraduate degree, there were only three programmes for training doctors.
				For MA courses, the rate was not much different, and the 10-course threshold was
				surpassed only in 1994. Throughout all of the following decade, only four new
				courses were added to the ones in existence, while the doctorates doubled from three
				to six.</p>
<p>An important inflexion in the patterns of expansion of the Political Science and
				International Relations postgraduate degrees can be seen from 2007. The growth curve
				of the MA courses shows a significant increase from that year onwards, propelled by
				the professional MAs and academic MAs in the Northeast, North and Centre-West. Out
				of the 21 new MA programmes approved between 2007 and 2013, 15 (71%) were
				professional or created by the institutes of higher education of the North,
				Northeast or Centre West. On the other hand, the expansion of the offer of PhDs in
				Political Science and International Relations seems not to have had enough momentum
				to keep up with the demand generated by these "new frontiers", whether territorial
				or professional, having remained stable in the last few years.</p>

</div>
			</p>
<p>If up until now the expansion of the postgraduate system by means of MA and PhD
				courses was the measure used to evaluate the institutionalisation of Political
				Science in Brazil, a more precise representation for analysing this process is to
				consider only the offer of PhD courses. The training of doctors is an inflexion in
				the postgraduate system, indicating a degree of institutional and scientific
				maturity achieved after years of experience in implementing academic MA programmes.
				The presence of PhDs in a scientific area shows that, the experience of the offer of
				courses concentrating on basic and general postgraduate training having been
				consolidated, academic institutions reached a higher level of scientific production
				and research, maturity of teaching staff and training of human resources, with
				significant advances in the professionalisation of academic activity.</p>
<p>Therefore, if implementing PhD courses is an appropriate indicator for identifying
				the degree of institutionalisation of a field of study, what might a time series of
				the number of Political Science PhDs indicate? In other words, the question at this
				stage is whether the moderate expansion curve of PhDs is a phenomenon common to
				other areas of knowledge or the neighbouring Social Science
					disciplines<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>, or a peculiarity of the development of
				Brazilian Political Science. <a href="#f02">Graph 2</a>, below,
				presents information that could provide a clue to answering this question.</p>
<p>
				<!--_ STANDARD  _--><div class="figure">

</div>
			</p>
<p>Until the beginning of the 1980s, there was a similar number of PhD programmes in
				Political Science, Sociology and Anthropology. As well as the two Political Science
				PhD programmes at USP and IUPERJ, there were two in Sociology (USP and IUPERJ) and
				two in Anthropology (USP and UFRJ). However, 16 years later, when the third
				Political Science PhD programme had only just been created (at UFRGS), Anthropology
				already had six PhD programmes and Sociology had 14. By 2004, the offer in Political
				Science had doubled to six, while Anthropology had reached nine and Sociology 24. If
				the rate of creation of new PhD courses in Political Science was enough to surpass
				Anthropology in 2008, it was still far from surpassing or even from being on a par
				with Sociology. Paradoxically, this is a phenomenon that goes against the principle
				of incremental returns suggested by the historical institutionalists, according to
				whom there are high costs to reversing the conditions present at the origin of
				social institutions. In this case, it is the contrary – although they started from a
				similar level, an inflexion occurred at an intermediate stage in the trajectory of
				each one of the areas, causing differences not in existence at the point of
				departure.</p>
<p>Another angle from which to analyse information on the expansion of postgraduate
				institutions is the territorial distribution of doctorates in the three areas (<a href="#f03">Graph 3</a>).</p>
<p>
				<!--_ STANDARD  _--><div class="figure">
<a name="f03"><!-- named anchor --></a><a target="_blank" href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v8n3//1981-3821-bpsr-8-3-0003-gf03.jpg"><img class="graphic" src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v8n3//1981-3821-bpsr-8-3-0003-gf03.jpg"></a><p class="label_caption"><span class="label">Graph 03 </span><span class="caption">States with PhD programmes </span></p>
</div>
			</p>
<p>In 1980, there were doctorates in all three areas in two Brazilian states, São Paulo
				and Rio de Janeiro. 20 years later, there was a Political Science PhD in another
				state (Rio Grande do Sul), while Sociology was already training doctors in 11
				states. 30 years later (or 41, considering the year of creation of its first MA
				programme), Political Science had doctorates in six states (São Paulo, Rio de
				Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, Pernambuco and the Federal District),
				which meant fewer that ¼ of the Brazilian states, and none in the Northern region.
				Meanwhile, Sociology, which had been at a similar level to the other areas, attained
				national reach with doctorates in 17 states in all of the Brazilian regions.</p>
<p>This analysis has hitherto considered only the offer of doctorate courses and its
				spread throughout the Brazilian territory through its presence in different states.
				This informs us as to the "installed capacity" to train high-level professionals in
				scientific research, but does not allow us to draw conclusions on the actual
				qualification rates. That is, on the capacity of the Political Science and
				International Relations programmes to train doctors. The graph below allows an
				initial approximation to be made by considering the PhD qualification rates in three
				areas (Political Science, Sociology and Anthropology), as well as averages for the
				entirety of the Brazilian postgraduate system. As the areas have different
				proportions (number of programmes and teaching staff), it does not make sense to
				present absolute numbers. Therefore, we considered the number of qualified doctors
				per capita, that is, the relationship between the number of qualified doctors every
				year and the number of permanent teaching staff in the postgraduate programmes in
				each area/year. The resulting information can be seen below, in <a href="#f04">Graph 4</a>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the period analysed, the number of doctors trained per permanent
				lecturer in PS and IR was at a low level (0.11), showing there was little less than
				one thesis defended per year for every 10 permanent scholars. At that point, in
				Sociology, the rate (0.39) was one thesis for every 2.6 scholars, while the
				behaviour of Anthropology was similar to the system’s average performance. It is
				likely that the scarce availability of doctorates in PS or IR at that point may have
				contributed to this poor performance. As we move towards the end of the period, the
				trends are inverted: Sociology and Anthropology keep up with the average trend of
				decreasing productivity in the training of doctors, while in the area of PS and IR a
				significant increase is registered, practically doubling the doctors/permanent staff
				ratio, reaching a rate of 0.21 (or one thesis per every five permanent staff
				members), drawing with Anthropology and practically catching up with the average
				behaviour of the Brazilian postgraduate system.</p>
<p>
				<!--_ STANDARD  _--><div class="figure">

</div>
			</p>
<p>An adequate measure for considering the degree of institutional consolidation of the
				areas and postgraduate programmes is obtained when the relationship between the
				number of doctors and masters trained in these institutions is compared. It is
				expected that the initial stages of implementation of a field of study or its
				postgraduate programmes will be characterised by a concentration in Master's degrees
				aimed at filling in the gaps in the training given by undergraduate programmes, and
				will offer an initial experience of applied research. An institutional inflexion can
				be observed when the centre of gravity of areas or institutions shifts to PhD
				courses. The repercussions of this are a strengthening of the ability to carry out
				research and scientific production, a systematic engagement of students in academic
				research and publishing projects and a less generalising education, more oriented
				towards the specialities resulting from differentiations within the discipline.
					<a href="#f05">Graph 5</a> shows a time series of the number
				of theses to dissertations recorded in the areas of Political Science (ps),
				Sociology (soc) and Anthropology (ant), as well as information on the average of the
				Brazilian postgraduate system.</p>
<p>
				<!--_ STANDARD  _--><div class="figure">

</div>
			</p>
<p>Until 2006, qualifications in the area of Political Science and International
				Relations followed a pattern of one thesis to five dissertations. In the same
				period, Anthropology came close to one thesis to two dissertations, a level that
				Sociology had already stabilised at since the end of the 1990s. Considering that the
				minimum period for a thesis to be concluded is four years, this means that until
				then only three PhD courses had succeeded in qualifying new doctors in Political
				Science. After 2007, and probably as a result of the first few groups graduating
				from the new PS and IR PhD courses created in the first half of the decade, we see a
				slight improvement, with close to one thesis for every three dissertations defended.
				By way of comparison, in the 2010-2012 period, in areas such as Astronomy &amp;
				Physics and Biological Sciences III the ratios of PhDs to Masters' qualified were
				0.52 and 0.58 respectively. Finally, it could be argued that differences in course
				duration – two years for a Master's degree and four years for a PhD – mean different
				proportions of student numbers in each of the levels, thus contributing to keep the
				differences in the number of masters to doctors. If this is correct, it should not
				subsume the importance of the institutional policy adopted in each programme/area in
				order to balance out the admission of MA and PhD candidates and attain greater
				efficacy in training doctors.</p>
<p>Following on from this point – a slower expansion of PS and IR PhD courses and a
				delay in the transference of the centre of gravity of postgraduate programmes from
				MAs to PhDs –, the next question concerns the institutions responsible for training
				the teaching and research staff that make up the programmes at present. In order to
				assess this, the makeup of the teaching staff of the 32 programmes from the area of
				Political Science and International Relations included in the triennial assessment
				of 2013 was examined. The data was extracted from the Capes Report 2012, reflecting
				the makeup of the teaching body for that year.</p>
<p>The information was systematised into four categories: "home institution", signifying
				an endogenous pattern of recruitment, where the lecturer qualified in the programme
				where he/she is currently employed; "Political Science/Brazil" (PS/BR), signifying a
				pattern of institutional or geographical mobility, with the lecturer having been
				trained in a Political Science programme other than the one where he/she was
				employed in 2012; "Other Area/Brazil" (oth/BR), where the lecturer qualified as a
				PhD in Brazil, but in programmes pertaining to areas of knowledge other than
				Political Science; and lastly, "abroad", which means a PhD obtained in institutions
				outside Brazil.</p>
<p>The results, which consider the aggregate behaviour in the Area of Political Science,
				as well as the distributions verified in each programme, can be seen in Table 1.</p>
<p>The first observation to be made is that endogeny was a relatively low behaviour in
				the PS and IR programmes – only 7.2% of permanent teaching staff had qualified in
				the programmes in which they were employed in 2012. Interestingly, a greater
				frequency of endogenous recruitment was found precisely in the old, consolidated
				programmes (USP, UFMG and UFRGS), where their role as protagonists in training and
				supplying doctors of Political Science influenced the absorption of graduates into
				their own vacancies. In other words, in a context of fewer possibilities of
				doctorates abroad (1990s and early 2000s), fewer doctorates in the area in Brazil
				and little space for doctors from other areas entering into traditional and
				hard-core programmes such as these, there might have been no other alternative but
				to seek out new researchers from their own graduates.</p>

<a name="TFN1"></a><p>Source: Capes Report, 2012</p>
<a name="TFN2"></a><p>Note: There is a discrepancy in the data on USP staff members
								presented in the Capes Report and that extracted from the Lattes
								Platform. According to information from the Lattes Platform, the
								qualification of one of the lecturers from this institution was

								CV.</p>
</div>
			</p>
<p>How should we interpret the presence of lecturers trained abroad? According to <sup><a href="#B2">Altman(2012)</a></sup>, the ability to recruit scholars
				with a PhD from institutions of international reputation, particularly US American
				ones, is an element to be considered when ranking the Political Science departments
				of Latin America. In other words, the presence of internationally qualified staff in
				itself might signify academic capital, making a distinction between institutions and
				Latin American countries. Not discounting the positive effect of training in the
				main international centres of excellence, this could be a bias and indicate the
				occurrence of a preliminary stage of institutional consolidation. A high density of
				qualifications obtained abroad could be seen in Brazilian Political Science
				programmes until the 1990s, and even more recently in Argentinian, Chilean and
				Uruguayan ones, basically indicating the dwindling number of PhD programmes offered
				in the countries mentioned. In contrast, it is expected that an expansion in the
				offer of programmes – especially if it is related to high-quality parameters – will
				be followed after a few years by a rise in the frequency of lecturers and
				researchers hired by their own or by other postgraduate programmes in the same
				country.</p>
<p>The pattern of institutional mobility, represented by the recruitment of staff with
				PhDs obtained in other programmes in Brazil, is a little over one to every four
				permanent lecturers in Brazil's Political Science programmes. This is more prominent
				in recently created programmes such as those of UFPA, UFG, FUFPI and UFPEL. That is,
				programmes in regions or mesoregions with a smaller institutional density of
				postgraduate programmes, which benefitted from the supply of doctors from the first
				few groups trained by the new PhD courses from the mid-2000s, or even, from specific
				actions such as the interinstitutional PhD programmes of Iuperj/UFPA and
				Unicamp/Fufpi. Using different data, <sup><a href="#B17">Madeira(2013)</a></sup> identified a similar pattern. Note that this recruitment
				pattern based on institutional or geographical mobility is less frequent in the
				older, consolidated programmes, which seem to prefer renewing their staff by
				recruiting from abroad or from their own institutions<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, what is the meaning of the fact that 48.1% of permanent teaching staff
				employed in Political Science or International Relations programmes obtained their
				PhD qualifications in Brazil, but in courses and programmes other than Political
				Science and International Relations? This seems to be a significant trend in more
				recently created programmes, professional Masters' and some International Relations
				programmes. Among the programmes in existence for over 10 years, the average
				proportion of scholars trained in Brazil but in other areas of knowledge is 29%. If
				we consider the more recently created programmes, in the last year, this proportion
				rose to 55.7%. Parallel to that, out of the 21 programmes created in the last 10
				years, eight were in International Relations, with a heterogeneous composition of
				teaching staff (History, Law and Economics, as well as Political Science), and six
				were in institutions of an interdisciplinary design. One possible interpretation for
				this phenomenon is the reduced offer of doctors in PS and RI, as a result of the
				delay in creating doctorates in the area until the mid-2000s. Parallel to that, we
				can consider that the interdisciplinary nature of these courses drove the creation
				of courses with professionals qualified in History, Law and Sociology, who had
				previously and firmly been part of higher education institutions. As well as being a
				symptom of the precarious or delayed institutionalisation of Political Science in
				Brazil, we can speculate about the implications of this (both positive and negative)
				for the constitution of an academic community with its own agenda and
				parameters.</p>
<p>This first section has sought to demonstrate the delayed process of
				institutionalisation of Political Science in Brazil. The area's scientific
				association began its activities with a four decade delay compared to its
				correlates, Sociology and Anthropology. After beginning at a similar level, from the
				1990s onwards there was a lag between the creation of postgraduate programmes in
				Political Science and Anthropology, but particularly between Political Science and
				Sociology. The more pronounced difference was in the offer of PhD courses, causing
				an undersized rate of PhD trainings. The consequence of this was a deficit of
				doctors, reflected particularly in the composition of staff of programmes created
				later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp368048"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Institutionalisation as a way of constituting an assessment system</p>
<p>A second dimension for examining the institutionalisation of a disciplinary field can
				be achieved by combining scientific research and qualified publication with an
				assessment of institutional performance based on peer judgment, as bases for
				constituting academic hierarchies and allocating resources for scientific
				investigation. Parallel to that, the integration of postgraduate and research groups
				into international networks and circles, and their visibility in the academic
				community, measured by means of impact indicators and citations, complement this
				process of academic institutionalisation. This section attempts to examine this
				dimension by considering the evolution of the scientific production of Political
				Science in Brazil and the institutional assessment carried out by Capes.</p>
<p>We can draw closer to an understanding of the identity of Political Science
				programmes when we aggregate the information on their lines of research. As the
				nomenclature of the lines of research varies greatly – with different names for the
				same content and specific lines side by side with combinations of thematic areas in
				one single line –, we chose to consider the lines of each of the programmes using a
				conventional grouping of thematic areas characteristic of the core of Political
				Science. These were the following: political theory, political culture,
				international politics, public policy, elections and parties, political institutions
				and society and participation. International Relations programmes were excluded, as
				it is not expected that IR programmes should have thematic lines associated with
				areas pertaining to PS – showing greater detail or specialisation within
				"International Relations" –, although they do use a thematic line titled
				"international politics".</p>
<p>
				<!--_ STANDARD  _--><div class="table-wrap">

</div>
			</p>
<p>A more advanced degree of institutional consolidation should translate into a more
				diversified teaching body, overcoming the thematic specialisation that goes with or
				propels a programme it in its initial stages. This does not mean that programmes do
				not have their own inclinations, with research results in areas in which they are
				stronger or more prolific, but a disposition towards a full thematic range, despite
				internal asymmetries in the productivity of each one of them. This trend is seen in
				older Programmes such as those of UFMG, USP, UFRGS, Unicamp, UNB and IESP, which
				show a range of themes in their research lines, including the discipline's entire
				research agenda, or almost all of it. In contrast, in more recent programmes, we see
				gaps in the lines of research, or even hyperspecialised programmes that show a line
				structure pertaining to a single thematic area.</p>
<p>Capes has carried out an assessment of Brazilian postgraduate programmes since 1976.
				This evaluation process involves two dimensions: (i) the accreditation of programmes
				and courses through the "Assessment of New Postgraduate Course Proposals" (APCN –
				Avaliação das Propostas de Cursos Novos de Pós-graduação), carried out annually and
				requiring minimum levels of quality for creating new programmes<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>; and (ii) the Triennial
				Assessment, when all the programmes recognised by the postgraduate system go through
				an assessment of their performance<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup> and are awarded a grade for indicators of
				scientific production, ability to train MAs and PhDs, degree of
				internationalisation, student publication and relevance for society<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>. Both the assessment
				of new courses and the triennial evaluation are (currently) carried out based on 48
				Areas of Knowledge<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>, perform a preliminary analysis and issue
				opinions to the Technical-Scientific Higher Education Council (CTC-ES – Conselho
				Técnico Científico de Educação Superior), which makes decisions regarding the
				parameters and criteria and grades attributed to the programmes<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>. The grades range from
				1 to 7, with 3 being the minimum grade for opening or keeping a course or programme,
				and 6 or 7 awarded to institutions with a performance akin to those of international
				centres of reference.</p>
<p>The core of the assessment carried out on the Brazilian postgraduate system can be
				whittled down to a combination of (i) scientific production – as a proxy for
				academic quality and vocation for research, (ii) the training of masters and
				doctors, but particularly doctors, and (iii) the degree of internationalisation
				obtained by each programme. According to the 2013 Triennial Evaluation Regulations,
				the maximum grade (7) must be awarded only to institutions with a "highly
				distinguished level of performance (in the training of doctors and intellectual
				production) in relation to other programmes in the area; and a performance
				equivalent to those of international centres of excellence in the field
				(internationalisation and leadership)"<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>. A high-level postgraduate programme is
				expected to display a strong capacity to train doctors. The quality required from
				this training is – indirectly – measured by the teaching body's vocation for
				research, confirmed by a high per capita frequency of publication in periodicals
				ranked in the upper Qualis categories and/or in highly rated books, of quality
				equivalent to that of the area's main international institutions.</p>
<p>For a programme to be awarded a grade 7 – the system's highest – its performance must
				be equivalent to that of international centres of excellence of its field. It must
				show highly distinguished indicators of scientific production compared to those of
				other programmes in the field, and the ability to train doctors and be awarded a
				"very good" grade in all the requirements and items of the
					evaluation<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>. It is therefore a reference point due to its
				degree of internationalisation and the recognition of its position of academic
				leadership within the international academic community.</p>
<p>The evolution of grade 7 programmes in Political Science (ps), Sociology (soc) and
				Anthropology (ant) can be analysed in the Graph below:</p>
<p>
				<!--_ STANDARD  _--><div class="figure">
<a name="f06"><!-- named anchor --></a><a target="_blank" href="/img/revistas/bpsr/v8n3//1981-3821-bpsr-8-3-0003-gf06.jpg"><img class="graphic" src="/img/revistas/bpsr/v8n3//1981-3821-bpsr-8-3-0003-gf06.jpg"></a><p class="label_caption"><span class="label">Graph 06 </span><span class="caption">Number of grade 07 programmes by area - 2001-2013 </span></p>
</div>
			</p>
<p>The institutional mismatch between the area of PS and IR in relation to its
				neighbours can be measured by the fact that compared to Anthropology and Sociology,
				they took longer to be awarded their first maximum grades. While the latter were
				awarded one and two sevens respectively in the 2001 Triennial Evaluation, another
				three triennial periods elapsed before the first maximum grades were achieved by
				Political Science programmes (USP and IUPERJ) in 2010.</p>
<p>Although scientific publication is not the only factor for assessing the performance
				of postgraduate institutions, it is an adequate measure for considering the vocation
				for academic research and the international visibility of the production by
				Brazilian researchers. In order to rate the scientific production of the
				postgraduate programmes, periodicals are classified into one of eight categories
				(A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 and C) based on criteria that vary in each area: the
				impact factor, indexing, internationalisation and qualitative criteria. In the
				Political Science Area, only publications in periodicals classed as A1, A2 and B1
				are considered when awarding points for scientific production. Among the
				requirements for the Area to consider a journal in these categories are the impact
				factor (for foreign periodicals), inclusion into the Scopus Bases (for A1 and A2)
				and in Scielo (for B1)<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The evolution of the scientific production of PS and IR can be observed in the
				information presented in the graph below, which portrays the most internationalised
				publications in the highest category of Qualis (IA until 2007, A1 after 2010).</p>
<p>
				<!--_ STANDARD  _--><div class="figure">

</div>
			</p>
<p>A clear evolution can be observed in the per capita production of the highest
				category of the Qualis/Capes classification: 657% between 2013 and 2014 and 103%
				when only the variation between the 2013 and 2010 triennial periods is considered.
				Journals classified in the A1 category represented 8.6% of the total periodicals in
				the Qualis/Political Science and International Relations classification in the
				2007/2009 triennial period. Their participation was reduced to 5.9% during the
				2010/12 triennial period, a 31.4% decrease in relative participation. In contrast,
				actual production increased by 103%, showing that in spite of the greater
				selectivity suggested by the smaller offer of periodicals in the period, there was a
				real increase in production of greater quality. Whether this was due to the
				inductive effect caused by the Qualis/Capes classification, which directed
				scientific production to periodicals in the higher categories, or because of the
				rise in scientific publication and research during that period, the fact is that
				there was significant growth in scientific production of greater quality per capita,
				measured by the international nature and selectivity of the periodicals in which it
				was published. Lastly, the 0.53 A1/per capita registered in the area of Political
				Science is close to the 0.60 shown by the area of Biological Sciences III, the
				leading area in Brazilian scientific production today<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The information presented by the SCImago Journal &amp; Country Rank allows this to be
				viewed from another angle, which enables us to grasp the evolution of the scientific
				production of Brazilian Political Science<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>. Constituted from the Scopus database,
				which collects information on publications in scientific periodicals of all areas of
				knowledge, ranking periodicals according to their volume of production, impact
				factor (SJR), citations and H-index, the SCImago records allow a comparison of
				journals, countries and areas of knowledge to be made, measuring intellectual
				production and its impact on the international scientific community.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the position of Brazilian Political Science in the ranking of
				the discipline's international community, considering two indicators: the volume of
				articles published in journals indexed and included in the Scopus database, and
				citations subsequent to these texts in new articles published in journals included
				in the database. The period of observation is 1998-2012<sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn18"><sup>18</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>. Initially, what draws
				attention is the significant evolution of Brazilian Political Science when the
				volume of production in published periodicals included in the Scopus database is
				considered. In 1998, Brazilian Political Science came 44<sup>th</sup> in the
				international Political Science community in terms of publications. PS/BR showed a
				rising trend, reaching 16<sup>th</sup> place in 2012 and rising by 28 places during
				this period. This notable evolution in a limited period of time could likely be
				explained by an improvement in the indexation of Brazilian journals and their
				inclusion into the Scopus database, but most of all by the significant growth in
				scientific research geared towards more selective and internationalised journals
				(captured in the previously portrayed information on the rise of A1 production per
				capita). Since 2004, Brazil has consolidated itself in the leading position in Latin
				America, surpassing Argentina, Chile and Mexico in indexed publications.</p>

</div>
			</p>
<p>On the other hand, when one considers the citations of Brazilian researchers
				registered, the position of PS/BR shows irregular behaviour, oscillating from the
					68<sup>th</sup> position in 2002 to the 20<sup>th</sup> (2010) and finally
				settling at 38<sup>th</sup> in the last record (2012). An interpretation of this
				combined information seems clear: Brazilian Political Science is publishing more,
				but its scientific production has low repercussion in the international community,
				measured by the number of citations of its articles.</p>
<p>What reasons might explain the limited repercussion of Brazilian publications in the
				area? The fact that they are in Portuguese, which has limited readership in the rest
				of the world, might be partly responsible. Although the participation of Brazilian
				periodicals in the A1 (6.9%) and A2 (1.1%) categories is low, the fact that a
				disproportionate amount of Brazilian production is published in Brazilian journals
				probably contributes to limiting its international visibility.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is international collaboration. The creation of
				international research networks, resulting in articles with international co-authors
				being published, boosts the production's visibility and its capacity to generate
				citations by the discipline's international community. However, the frequency of
				international collaboration in the scientific production of Brazilian Political
				Science is limited and at a lower level when compared to its Chilean and Mexican
				counterparts.</p>

							production </span></p>
</div>
			</p>
<p>An additional angle through which to analyse international collaboration can be
				obtained by comparing the information on co-authorships among researchers of the
				three previously compared Brazilian areas (Political Science, Anthropology and
				Sociology). The result of this procedure can be observed in <a href="#f10">Graph 10</a>, below.</p>
<p>

</div>
			</p>
<p>Once again, two isolated moments of greater international cooperation (1998 and
				2006-2007) stand out from a dominant pattern of isolation and lower frequency of
				academic interactions with researchers from other countries. When we consider the
				average percentage of documents published by authors from more than one country in
				the 1996/2012 period, we see less interaction between Brazilian political scientists
				and their international peers (16.7%) than sociologists (23%) and anthropologists
				(37%) and theirs.</p>
<p>Aside from international collaboration, the publishing of articles by international
				authors in Brazilian journals could be an opportunity to increase their prestige in
				the international community and therefore maximise the visibility of the production
				of Brazilian researchers. The graph below presents the proportion of articles
				authored by foreign researchers in the main Brazilian periodicals. Only journals in
				Qualis category A1 in the area of Political Science and International Relations in
				the 2000-2010 period were considered. By way of comparison, information on the
				Revista de Ciencia Política edited by the Catholic University of Chile, equally
				classified as A1, is also presented.</p>

</div>
			</p>
<p>The main Brazilian periodicals, classified in the highest Qualis/Capes category, seem
				to be journals that publish work by Brazilian researchers in Portuguese. In spite of
				the quality, tradition and reputation acquired, participation by international
				authors in the main Brazilian scientific periodicals in the Area of Political
				Science and International Relations is minimal. In 10 years, only 9% of articles
				published in Dados, 10.3% of those published in RBCP and 14.9% of those published in
				RBPI were authored by or co-authored with foreign researchers. Opinião Pública was
				the exception to this rule, with almost one third of its articles co-authored with
				international authors. The contrast is evident when this information is compared
				against data from the Chilean Revista de Ciencia Política. In it, around ¾ of
				articles published had the participation of non-Chilean authors in the same
				period.</p>
<p>As well as the authors' language and nationality, it can be equally relevant to
				consider the themes of the articles published by Brazilian political scientists in
				Brazilian periodicals classed in the highest Qualis/Capes category. Since the aim is
				now to assess the dimension of the main themes dealt with, we chose not to consider
				journals of a wider scope such as RBCS and Lua Nova, whose inclusion of themes from
				Anthropology and Sociology would make any comparison biased. The same is the case
				with RBPI and Contexto Internacional and International Relations themes. Thus, two
				A1 journals (OP and Dados) and two A2 journals (BPSR and RSP), more focused on
				Political Science themes, were considered. The triennial period observed was
				2010/12.</p>

<p>Articles on "Brazilian politics" were equivalent to around ⅔ of the scientific
				production in journals of the higher Qualis categories in 2010/12. The social
				sciences usually deal with their objects of study in a certain territory, and it is
				expected that "Brazilian politics", "Brazilian society" and "Brazilian history" etc.
				should be relevant themes, and certainly themes of great interest to Brazilian
				political scientists, anthropologists, sociologists and historians. On the other
				hand, the small amount of work on positive political theory and methodology, as well
				on more comparative approaches, seems to reveal the scarce nomological ambitions of
				Brazilian political scientists. The profession of scientist of politics consists in
				attempting to build general causal inferences to explain the formation, stability
				and change process of political institutions. In the last two decades, Brazilian
				Political Science has made significant advances in knowledge on the morphology of
					<em>Brazilian</em><strong> "</strong>coalition presidentialism", party
				discipline <em>in Brazil</em>, federalism and intergovernmental relations
					<em>in Brazil</em>, the behaviour of <em>Brazilian</em> voters,
				and the growth of social expenditures and public policies <em>in
					Brazil</em><sup>[</sup><sup><a href="#fn21"><sup>21</sup></a></sup><sup>]</sup>. The numbers relative to the scientific
				production published in Brazilian journals show a vocation for the study of a
				specific national case. It seems evident that this option comes at a price, in the
				shape of limited repercussion in the international community. It is unlikely that
				journals of a higher impact factor will publish many articles on Brazilian politics.
				Except perhaps for Brazilianists, few authors will search for articles on Brazilian
				politics, published in Brazilian journals, to cite in their publications.</p>

<a name="idp490960"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Conclusion</p>
<p>What difference does greater or lesser institutionalisation of a discipline make?
				This article has attempted to analyse the process of institutionalisation of
				Brazilian Political Science from the creation of the first few postgraduate
				programmes in the area at the end of the 1960s. By institutionalisation, we
				understand the constitution of professional spaces – represented by scientific
				associations and academic institutions, which distance the researcher's craft from
				dilettante amateurism – and, parallel to that, the emergence of an assessment system
				based on peer judgement.</p>
<p>As well as the late constitution of its scientific association, a disparity can be
				observed between the expansion of Political Science postgraduate institutions and
				that of areas such as Sociology or Anthropology. This has repercussions, which are
				that Political Science has a smaller presence in Brazil and that there has been a
				deficit in training doctors, which has impacted on the formation of new postgraduate
				institutions.</p>
<p>Regarding the institutional assessment, Brazilian Political Science has felt the
				effects of its late institutionalisation, having been awarded its first sevens only
				in 2010. In spite of scientific productivity indicators showing very significant
				positive variance, we see low visibility indexes and a low impact of this production
				in the field's international community. The fact that a significant part of the
				production is published in Portuguese, by Brazilian journals, with little
				international collaboration, addressing themes that are territorially delimited and
				related to "Brazilian politics", with a limited amount of production focusing on
				political theory (whether normative or positive) or compared studies, might help to
				explain the yet restricted repercussion of the growing scientific production of
				Brazilian Political Science.</p>

<a name="fn6"></a><p><sup>6</sup> Here, we chose to maximise the similarities between the compared disciplines or
					cases, attempting to indicate the different patterns between them. Although the
					inclusion of cases/disciplines such as Economics, Law or Education could provide
					useful information, it would mean making a different comparative design,
					maximising the differences among cases in order to highlight the similarities
					between them. In Brazil, Political Science, Sociology and Anthropology have had
					a common trajectory, proven by academic ties such as, for example, the
					Associação Nacional de Pesquisa e Pós-Graduação em Ciências Sociais (ANPOCS –
					National Association for Research and Postgraduate Studies in Social Sciences),
					undergraduate courses in Social Sciences and in the majority of higher education
					institutions and postgraduate programmes starting at similar points in time.
					Although outside Brazil Political Science is very close to subjects such as
					Economics and Law, in Brazil, the latter have had origins and trajectories more
					distant from Political Science, which would considerably increase the
					heterogeneity and degrees of difference in a sample including them.</p>

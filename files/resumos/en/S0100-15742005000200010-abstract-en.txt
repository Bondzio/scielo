The objective of this study is to understand what has been occurring in the spheres of public and private education in Brazil, concerning the application of art. 23 of the Guidelines and Bases Act of Education - LDB -, Law n. 9.394/96, which deals with the organization of school times. This law has caused a diversified situation by allowing flexibility and delegating autonomy to teaching institutions to decide on school time's organization. The data indicate that the public schools are moving more quickly towards an organization based on cycles, whereas the private ones are more inclined to keep grades. Recent statistic data, supplied by the National Institute of Pedagogical Studies and Research An√≠sio Teixeira - Inep -, prove it. The reasons why public teaching institutions adopt the learning cycle have been discussed in many publications. However, when the private schools are focused, it is not known what the reasons for non-adhesion to learning cycle are, as well as the motives that make them to maintain the graded system.

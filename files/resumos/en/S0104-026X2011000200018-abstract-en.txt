This article presents a reflection from the perspective of feminism as a critical theory, attempting to make visible distortions in the perspective of gender. The analysis is based on the winning texts of the first contest of children's literature from a gender perspective, implemented and coordinated by the Ministry of Education of Chile in 2008. The questions which guided this study were: What do girls and boys say about gender relations in their literary creations? Why were the 4 texts selected as winners? Among the most significant findings is the fact that, despite considerable changes in the global context, the winning texts reassert the patriarchal system, not incorporating other discursive practices which are present in the national and international contexts.

This study aims to register possible changes in teaching concepts and teaching practices, resulting from a systematic effort of reflection, in a preparation course for science teachers. In the School of Education, the participants used to see the videos showing their actions in secondary classes, analyzing, discussing and reelaborating their teaching concepts and practices. The study describes also the features of teacher-students interactions, which promoted the desiquilibrium and accommodation processes.

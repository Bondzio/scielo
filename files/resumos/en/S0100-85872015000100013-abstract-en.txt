Abstract This paper is a historical analysis of the life of African freedman Jos&#233; Pedro Autran, who was married to Iy&#225; Nass&#244;, the founder of the Casa Branca candombl&#233; temple in Bahia. The first section examines Autran&#8217;s heterogeneous social network between 1822 and 1837, arguing that kinship, baptismal liaisons, spiritual initiation and slave holding formed an important base of support of both the household and his wife&#8217;s religious community. Next, the paper turns to the return voyage to Africa in 1837 that ended in the port city of Ouidah. The closing section, based on ethnographic data from Ouidah, focuses on the memories of a family that claims descent from Jos&#233; Pedro Autran, regarding the history of a Xang&#244; temple that he is said to have founded.

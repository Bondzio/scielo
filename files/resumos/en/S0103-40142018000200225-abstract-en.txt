Abstract This text reviews an analysis I made over three decades ago, focused on the path which the Brazilian sanitary reform went through, updating the debate about the complexity of both the proposal and the project of implementing the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS). It emphasizes the political strategy for its implementation, along with the contemporary challenges, in order to maintain its principles and constitutional guidelines, especially after the recent &#8220;bureaucratic- legislative coup&#8221; in 2016.

Abstract: This article aims to promote a reflection about the importance of a new form of science, as well as about the possible principles for a feminist science. Here, it is proposed the replacement of the neo-positivist model for a new one, which understands the different forms to produce knowledge, adopts the idea of situated knowledge and that, instead of the liberalism, embodies the commitment with the social emancipation. This new model also should include a new objective: instead of to seek a universal law in the world, seeks the translation of different realities and allows the accountability between the subjects of research.

ABSTRACT Based on the study of the academic and professional training paths of teachers at two public universities in São Paulo, this article discusses the relationship between the public and the private sectors in the higher education system in Brazil and, in particular, in São Paulo. The data source is the curriculum vitae database of the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico [National Council for Scientific and Technological Development] - CNPq -, Lattes Platform. Based on the results, we show: i) the overlapping of the individual paths of academic training and professional practice of the teachers surveyed, with the processes of expansion and differentiation of the offer of higher education in the country; ii) the existence of patterns of movement of the teachers surveyed in the national system of higher education, which show marked academic endogeny and hierarchization of the public and private institutions.

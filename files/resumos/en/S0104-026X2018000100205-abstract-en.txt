Abstract: This article presents the results of a survey conducted in 14 public maternity wards of the State of Tocantins, where 56 women were interviewed by means of a semi-structured interview. The study aimed to identify women's perceptions about violence in the obstetric delivery process. The perception of women about obstetric violence appeared to be related to the lack of quality and reception in care, highlighting the occurrence of various expressions of obstetric violence such as neglect, physical, verbal, psychological violence. A breach in important regulations, the non-utilization of recommendations based on scientific evidence and the breach of the main rights of parturient women were found, setting the magnitude of the violence and the need for improving obstetric services.

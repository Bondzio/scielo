In this paper I discuss apprenticeship experiences of a heterosexual, racialized and class based sexuality in a group of upper-middle class men self-identifying as white, ranging from 43 to 60 years old, in Rio de Janeiro. I examine respondents' accounts on what was defined during the interview as "sexual initiation" with female domestic workers or prostitutes during their adolescence. I concentrate on the analysis of a relationship of domination as it is described by who exercises domination. This analysis discloses how these experiences participate in the production of men's sexuality, and at the same time determine their color and class identity.

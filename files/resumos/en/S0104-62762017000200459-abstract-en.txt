Abstract Interactive experiences online have been stimulating the development of public debate. Facebook, for example, has attracted citizens and institutions, as well as communication enterprises that see in this tool an opportunity for greater interaction with an audience. This paper identifies the characteristics of the debate among audiences in the official Facebook pages of the three main Brazilian newspapers (Folha de S.Paulo, O Estado de S.Paulo e O Globo) on the 2014 presidential election. Therefore, we have observed in 610.660 comments: 1) the debate&#8217;s intensity over time; 2) the commentator&#8217;s position (reciprocity); 3) justification; and 4) reflexivity. Among our main findings, one might highlight the predominance of monologues and the low level of justification. However, Facebook can be considered a space for persuasion, which prevailed in the comments.

Abstract Starting by confronting two contrasting images of Brazilianness associated with sexuality, I develop a discussion about the changing theoretical and political meanings that can take on reflections regarding the connections between pleasures and dangers, concerning both feminism and sexual and gender diversity issues. I try to explore the constant and productive tension between these contradictory ideals as narratives, which are effective in constructing social ways of understanding and experiencing gender and sexuality.

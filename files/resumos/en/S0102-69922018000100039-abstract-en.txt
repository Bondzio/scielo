Abstract This article presents a reflection on the interaction between science and public policy. based on interviews with policymakers from two ministries (Agrarian Development and Environment). The aim of the study was to identify the place attributed to scientific knowledge in the policy making process. For this it was necessary to recognize the policymakers&#8217; perceptions of science. As a theoretical basis, we start from a critique of the notion of evidence-based policy, which proposes the instrumentalization of scientific knowledge by policy, in order to achieve the notion of &#8220;co-production&#8221; proposed by Jasanoff. This author argues that science, politics and culture are co-produced, being impossible to establish clear boundaries between them. We conclude that, among the interviewees, it prevails the valuation of science objectivity as a critical point to legitimate policy decisions. But, contradictorily, they also demand for greater involvement between science and government interests. It was also observed that, in spite of the difficulties noted on this interaction managers practices and discourses were permeated with references to scientific knowledge.

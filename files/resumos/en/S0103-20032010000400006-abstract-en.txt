The present article aimed to measure the economic costs of the domestic production soybean area in the cerrado (one type of vegetation in Brazil) of Piauí, in the systems of conventional and tillage, caused by the process of erosion in the 2000/2001 and 2007/2008 seasons. It analyzes the historical process of international integration of the Brazilian economy through the primary-exporting model, emphasizing the intensive use of natural resources as factor of competitiveness, characterized by the occupation and use of Brazilian cerrado and based on the soybean production and examined the consequences and risks to the biome arising from that process. The methodological procedure focused on the literature review and statistical from secondary data and the application of the replacement cost of nutrients method, to verify the economic impact of soil degradation in the region. Through the research, it was found that in both periods of crop and planting systems analyzed, costs of replacement were significant, representing, on average, 2.9 percent of the total soybean production. In the 2000/2001 season, the cost per hectare was 22.96 reais and 21.93 reais for conventional tillage and direct planting, respectively. While in the 2007/2008 crop, harvest costs were 22.40 reais and 21.20 reais, respectively. Therefore, this configuration explained the relative stability of the value of the loss of land during the period under review, once having presented low decrease in the 2007/2008 season. Therefore, it is inferred that the use of the system of tillage in the soybean planting in the cerrado of Piauí not only has economic advantages, but above all, has contributed to the sustainability of the agro ecosystem.

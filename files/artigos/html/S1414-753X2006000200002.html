O artigo apresenta    uma revisão do debate teórico e dos principais resultados de pesquisa realizada    em 2004 com os membros dos cinco subcomitês que compõem a bacia do Alto Tietê,    na Região Metropolitana de São Paulo. A base analítica do trabalho se apóia    no referencial conceitual do capital social, como instrumento para avaliar o    desenvolvimento institucional destes espaços de gestão compartilhada de recursos    hídricos. A análise possibilita a avaliação do nível de associativismo, confiança,    reciprocidade e cooperação para a consolidação de uma performance mais efetiva.    <br>   </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Os resultados    apresentados mostram que os comitês de bacias hidrográficas são arenas apropriadas    para desenvolver um estudo comparativo sobre desempenho institucional e sua    relação com práticas cooperativas vinculadas com a preservação e a gestão territorial    e ambiental. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Palavras Chave:</b>    Gestão de bacia hidrográfica, Comitês de bacia hidrográfica, Capital Social,    Instituições, Descentralização.</font></p> <hr size="1" noshade>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> <b>1. Environmental    policy and social 000000 participation in Brazil</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the context    of post-democratic transition in Brazil and due to pressures from a coherent    and self-organized civil society, new deliberative arenas were created (AVRITZER,    2002; Nobre, 2005), many of them relating to promotion of negotiations over    environmental management and governance. Within this context, social participation    (JACOBI, 2000; NOBRE, 2005; GUIVANT &amp; JACOBI, 2005) emerged as a referential    of ruptures and tensions, and the participative practices became associated    with a qualitative upgrade in the way society manages and governs its natural    resources (Jacobi, 2003; Avritzer and Navarro, 2003; Dagnino, 2002; Melo, 2005,    Jacobi, 2005; Jacobi, 2006)&#160; These institutional transformations and the    enlargement of participatory arenas within organized sectors of society, indicates    the build up and consolidation of new institutions (AVRITZER, 2005; ZHOURI,    2006). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The consolidation    of public policies framed by the participatory component is related to changes    in Brazil's socio-political matrix, following a debate over the state's role    as the main driver in social and environmental policies (JACOBI, 2005). The    consolidation of deliberative arenas is essential for the strengthening of a    democratic, integrated and shared management of natural resources. The main    challenge for these newly public arenas is to strengthen deliberative democracy,    with regards both to its format as well as to its outcomes. Conflict is inherent    to them, as is democracy. These arenas of policy formulation, where civil society    participates actively, are marked by contradictions and by the publicizing of    conflicts. They represent a public arena where &#151; discussion, negotiation    and voting characterize it as a legitimate and democratic locus of interaction    between social actors. This implies in the constitution of the habermasian notion    of public sphere where participation and public argumentation, and where as    Avritzer (2002) states the deliberative process is at stake.&#160;&#160;The    conditions for this new sociability will be fostered by management dynamics    that emphasize public deliberation (JACOBI, 2005) and plurality of actors participating    within the process.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regards to    natural resources management in Latin America, literature indicates (Dourojeanni,    2002, Cabral, 2005) that by the end of the eighties, the debate around public    policies and natural resources was structured around two fairly new concepts    for the region: decentralization and democratization. With regards to water    resources, the concept behind IWRM &#151; Integrated Water Resources Management    was the cornerstone for much of the reforms that took place in the water sector.    Countries like Brazil, Chile and Mexico, to mention a few, have deeply incorporated    these principles in their water reforms (ABERS &amp; DINO, 2005). Nonetheless,    the outcomes of the reforms are still a fuzzy subject. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within the political    framework settled by the transition towards a stronger democratic State, new    environmental forums were created in Brazil during the early nineties. Social    participation gained substantial attention from both government and society,    as the country saw an emergence of different forms of social organizations (Jacobi,    2000; Jacobi, 2005; Furriela, 2002; Sousa J&uacute;nior, 2004). Changes in the    traditional political and institutional settings, along with the broadening    of social participation in public affairs have demanded the need for new democratic    institutions, responsible for crafting regulations over natural resources management.&#160;&#160;    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The phenomena of    public policies made under social participation are strongly related to changes    in Brazil's political <I>momentum.</I> In Latin America as a whole and in Brazil    in particular, the nineties set the grounds for a fierce debate about State's    role, especially with regards to its closure towards civil society participation    in policy making (AASELRAD, 1992). If we are concerned about democratic and    decentralized institutions, then efforts must be made in order to strengthen    broader and participative forums. In Brazil, the broadening of these new arenas    for public participation on policy making enhanced citizenship both in a quantitative    and in a qualitative way (DAGNINO, 2002). Watershed committees are a good example    of how institutional reforms may enhance social participation and bring State    and society together by closing the gap between the public and private divide.    The challenge beset now is to make these watershed committees effective in their    main attribution: govern the watershed in a sustainable way.&#160; </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The shift from    a technical point of view to an institutional approach in water resources analysis    is consistent with a vast body of development literature (Polanyi, 1944; Hirschman,    1977, Ravallion, 1997; Sen, 1997, 1999; Veiga, 2005), which strongly relies    on socio-political aspects rather than solely on technical ones. In the domain    of water resources management in Brazil, this is particularly true since the    scarcity of water raised new conflicts. The resolution of these conflicts accrues    from new institutions, responsible for crafting and controlling norms for water's    access and use (MONTEIRO, 2004). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When analyzing    the trends in water policy in Brazil, two aspects draws one's attention: first,    the social capital within these committees, that is to say the role played by    trust, solidarity, reciprocity and associational life of committee's members    (PUTNAM,1993); and secondly the interactions and coordination between public    and private stakeholders, from a State &#151; society synergy point of view    (EVANS, 1997).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>2. Social capital,    State-Society synergy and social networks analysis</B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With regards to    social capital, the emergence of social phenomena such as corruption, civil    violence, uprisings, and social inequalities have led researchers to believe    that besides structural and intellectual needs &#151; that is to say physical    and human capital &#151; both networks and patterns of group behavior also play    an important role if development is to befall (WOOLCOCK, 1999; COLEMAN, 1990;    OSTROM, 1990; PUTNAM, 1993). Groups where most of the people are trustworthy    and their interactions are based on values such as solidarity, reciprocity and    shared beliefs are more likely to cooperate, especially because these characteristics    promote collective action (PORTES, 1998; KRISHNA, 2000; UPHOFF, 2000). The vast    body of literature on the effects of social capital over institutional performance    (PUTNAM, 1993; Serageldin, 1998; Isham, 2000) allows us to seek explanations    for better institutions based on this theoretical framework.&#160; </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The State &#151;    society paradigm indicates that polycentric institutions perform better when    private and public stakeholders have the ability to coordinate their actions    (OSTROM, 1990; EVANS, 1997). What allows groups with high heterogeneity to achieve    high scores of efficiency in its programs and policies is the amalgam between    private and public stakeholders, expressed by a dense social network among public    servants and civil society representatives (TENDLER, 1997; Lin, 1989), in what    has been referred to as embedded autonomy. The idea behind the concept of embedded    autonomy refers to those day-to-day interactions between the public and private    domains, and to all liability built upon this relationship (EVANS, 1997).&#160;    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Therefore, the    coordination between strong public institutions and organized communities can    be an effective development mechanism. Stronger ties, cohesion and reciprocity    between these stakeholders will ultimately make collective action more likely    to happen, thus promoting higher institutional performance. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Social networks    are built upon the existence of bonds that individuals or groups of individuals    built intentionally from a common shared reference. The way in which each individual    positions him/herself in the network will determine in the last instance his/her    conditions and possibilities of interference and power, and the relationship    standards generated by these networks can be used to explain political and social    phenomena (MARQUES, 1999; 2003). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to    acknowledging these networks, social networks analysis is an analytical instrument    that allows us not only to experimentally rebuild social networks, but also    to verify their influence on political and social processes (MARQUES, 2003).    The central focus of social networks analysis is the relationship among actors,    and not of their categories or attributes. Attribute data have to do with the    characteristics or qualities, while relationship data have to do with contacts,    bonds, connections, or groupings of people that relate to one another, and therefore    cannot be reduced to the individual properties of the actors (SCOTT, 1992; EMIRBAYER,    1997). Though important for the description of numerous phenomena, the characteristics    and attributes do not have to do with social actions, but with their actors    instead. In this sense, they explain a part of the phenomena, but leave aside    important processes that can be studied only by considering bonds and relationships    directly (MARQUES, 1999). Based on this methodology, by using the concept of    networks, a great detail of individual relationships without losing sight of    the structure of the whole field and the more general standards can be achieved.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, the analysis    of social networks constitutes an appropriate method for verifying the patterns    of social relationships and their configuration in watershed committees, allowing,    through their multiple techniques, for the representation and analysis of the    interactions between the government and the civil society. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>3. Water Policy    in Brazil </B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Brazil, water    policy has historically aimed primarily for hydroelectric power, and secondarily    for irrigation.&#160; Provision of adequate supplies of clean water for cities,    and treatment of the rivers of waste was not a priority for many years. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The water sector    in Brazil has historically been controlled by user sectors, particularly energy,    sanitation, irrigation and the industry.&#160; These sectors enjoyed great autonomy    in water management decisions, working under their own internal perspectives    and rationale.&#160; The electricity sector is the one which maintained the    largest domain, and until very recently it still enjoyed water rights concession    powers, without being subject to major social and environmental concerns of    its own enterprises, particularly dams and water diversions.&#160; The sanitation    sector, with its large investment capacity, also maintained a major control    of water management decisions (CABRAL, 2005, TUNDISI, 2003). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Decentralization    of water management occurs in the context of the overall reduction of the Brazilian    state.&#160; These reforms lasted for half-century during which the state was    the driving force of the development process. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering water    resources, the 1988 National Constitution established as a cornerstone, the    extinction of private property rights over water, and issued all property rights    over water use to the Union and the States. The institutional setting is complex,    and the decision making forums are partitioned by several agencies, not always    convergent. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public companies    are responsible for most of the water-market, leaving private companies with    a mere residual market share. Almost 70% of all Brazilian municipalities have    their water supplied by 26 state owned utility companies. In approximately 1500    municipalities, most of them midsize and small cities located in the Southeast,    the population is served by municipal services. Recent data indicates that there    are around 60 municipalities served by private companies, mostly in midsize    cities in the Southeast region, representing 4% of urban population (VARGAS,    2005). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the decrease    in the state's role in economy, there is a drive for more operational rationality.&#160;    At the federal level, the Law 9433/1997 establishes the National Water Resources    Policy, through the National Water Resources System. The Law 9984/2000 regulates    the establishment of a National Water Agency (<I>Ag&ecirc;ncia Nacional das    &Aacute;guas, ANA</I>), a federal institution created to implement the National    Water Resources Policy and co-ordinate the National Water Resources Management    System. (JACOBI, 2003) </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the 9433/1997's    piece of legislation, which established that water management should adopt the    water-basin approach, and implement river basin committees, all rivers in Brazil    must be classified according to desirable quality levels, depending on the existing    or projected uses, environmental conditions and framing.&#160;&#160; From the    environmental perspective, such framing is very important since it signals to    water users an objective to be achieved in terms of controlling discharges.    Environmental goals (quantity and quality) can be attained by a plan of water    management feasible through financial revenues brought by charging for the use    of water. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the 1990's most    Brazilian states and the federal government passed new legislation on water    resource management.&#160; The legislation placed decision-making power at the    lowest feasible level (generally the watershed), mandated user fees, and management    <I>fora</I> in which civil society and water users would participate, and gave    priority to provision of water to populations over other uses. The new laws    mandated decentralized institutional arrangements, and changed the conception    of water from a free good to one that must be paid for. &#160;The move to basin-level    management coincides with an effort to privatize electric and sanitation companies,    some of the biggest users of water. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A reform of the    water resource management was conducted. The driving concepts behind the reform    were: decentralization, materialized by the adoption of the water basin (watershed)    as the territorial unit for the elaboration of management plans; integration,    between stakeholders (State, Municipalities and civil society); and coordination    between the technical, financial and political spheres (Rocha, 1998, Sousa Junior,    2004). As for water users, the main change was the creation of WBCs &#151; Watershed    Basin Committees (Comit&ecirc;s de Bacia Hidrogr&aacute;fica). These committees    are the parliament for debating on all issues related to water management in    a specific water basin. Their structure foresees the equal participation of    all three stakeholders relevant to the proper functioning of public management:    State, municipalities and civil society. Together, these actors should coordinate    the activities related to the use and protection of water resources within the    water basin (Jacobi &amp; Monteiro, 2004). These committees have become responsible    for water basin planning, development and preservation. These reforms brought    clear and specific demands regarding the actions and attributions of these committees,    and&#160;the system clearly allows socio-environmental issues and land use planning    and management to be put on the agenda alongside the question of water allocation    and therefore provides a mechanism for realistic environmental goals to be established    for the basin.&#160; </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Brazilian system    is patterned after the French model, and it differs by granting basin organizations    a decision-making role, rather than an advisory one.&#160; The committees will    ultimately be responsible for agreeing on acceptable levels of pollution, balancing    the interests of various water users, including the population at large and    of environmental authorities as well.&#160; The process of reaching agreement    among different users will be a political balance between costs benefits of    alternative water quantity and quality goals, the way water will be allocated,    and who the beneficiaries and payers will be (JACOBI, 2006). The new system    has, in fact, been a major and fundamental step forward to integrate environmental    issues into the traditional process of water quantity allocation.&#160; </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The key players    at the basin level are part of a process that aims at bringing together the    various parties who have an interest in the water resources of the basin in    order to resolve conflicting views and objectives in an open and consensual    manner. They include three sectors: 1) Water resources agencies, companies and    environmental state agencies, 2) municipalities, 3) sectors of large users of    water, energy, industry and irrigation, civil society representation (movements,    organizations, NGOs, universities, unions, and other institutions). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They are organised    by Water Basin Committees, which typically include all the viewpoints necessary    for a comprehensive and sustainable planning process, although this coverage    does not necessarily mean that the outcomes will be completely balanced. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the effective    implementation of these reforms has had different outcomes, what suggests that    the fate of these newly crafted institutions depends upon a series of factors.    One of the most important is the committees' ability to constitute itself in    a way that cooperation between the various interests represented there are encouraged,    so that challenges related to the use and protection of water resources can    be overcome. Thus, we believe that the ability of these institutions to coordinate    their actions in cooperative way is increased as the synergy between State and    society and the stock of social capital among these stakeholders grow (MONTEIRO,    2004). </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>4. Water resources    in Brazilian metropolitan areas</B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Water resources    management in Brazil can be better understood from a demographic and socioeconomic    perspective. Urban growth in Brazil has been rising constantly, resulting in    highly populated cities. Between 1950 and 2000, urban population went from 36%    to 81% of total country's population (IBGE, 2000). The nine metropolitan areas    created in the 1970s housed 41.9 million inhabitants in 1991, and 48.9 million    in 2000, keeping its relative participation (respectively 28.7% and 28.8%) in    total country's population (IBGE, 2000).&#160; </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Environmental problems    within Brazilian's metropolitan centres have increased rapidly in the last 50    years, and the inadequacies in addressing them have led to large impacts such    as very large increases in the number and scale of floods, difficulties in the    management of solid wastes and the environmental damage arising from inadequate    waste management, and high levels of air pollution.&#160; Much of this is related    to uncontrolled urban expansion.&#160; The expansion of metropolitan areas has    brought an increasing environmental deterioration, since the appropriation of    space reflects prevailing socio-economic inequalities. It is marked by the inadequacies    or even total absence of public policies to address these problems, and the    inertia in public administration in identifying and addressing these problems    &#151; and implementing measures to manage land use and guarantee improvements    in the quality of life (Grostein, 2005; Jacobi, 2001). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The environmental    problems arise mainly from the precariousness of the services and the failure    of the public authorities.&#160;But they also reflect the neglect of the dwellers    themselves, even in the neighbourhoods that lack infrastructure. This highlights    the conflict between urban environmental problems and the practices of resistance    of those who have the means to address the problems. This can be seen in the    defence of individual interests that significantly interfere with the quality    of life for the city as a whole. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since large numbers    of households are not connected to sewer systems, there are problems with sewage    dumping on land sites, illegal connections to surface-water drains and direct    dumping in the rivers.&#160; Cities are constantly affected by increasing numbers    of floods in critical points. The disposal of solid wastes has become highly    problematic in most cities because of lack of spaces for disposal.&#160; Precarious    dwelling conditions in slums and peripheral plots increase the deficit of urban    infrastructure; their location in critical areas often increases&#160;environmental    degradation. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The inadequacies    in public policies in regard to the intense process of urbanization and the    lack of a legislation regarding land use that could help control non compliance    growth create an "illegal city" that occupies the empty spaces of the city,    mainly in under valuated areas, including those around manatiales. It is mostly    low-income groups that face daily risks of flooding, collapse of slopes, soil    and water pollution due to illegal disposal of industrial toxic wastes, accidents    with hazardous loads, leaks in petrol stations, and dangerous coexistence with    mining and quarrying facilities, due to high levels of air pollution and noise.    The close relationship between urban risks and the problem of use and occupation    of land is obvious.&#160; Among the determining aspects of environmental conditions    in cities, this is the one which is more difficult to address and where improved    administrative and management skills from local authorities is required. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jacobi (2004) points    out that the still fast growth pace of these agglomerations, their geographic    expansion, and the lack of proper land planning &#151; always linked to poverty    &#151; leads to a series of problems: 1) pollution of water streams; 2) increasing    number of floods, usually associated to high rates of soil impermeability; 3)    erosion problems, especially in slopes occupied by low income urban dwellers;    4) human settlements over creeks and other water bodies, what is especially    unhealthy; 5) growing pressure over the water resources available for public    supply; 6) difficulties in protecting springs threatened by extensive urban    sprawl; 7) limited water availability and inter-regional conflicts over water    use 8) urban sprawl over watershed areas; 9) low raw water quality at catchments,    due to domestic, industrial and agricultural pollution; and 10) domestic and    industrial pollution of rivers that cross metropolitan areas, what negatively    impacts the water supply within the catchment's basin. Although metropolitan    areas concentrate a considerable part of the economic activity, they have always    stood out for growing levels of poverty, which results in over demanding public    services. In 2000, 60% of the Brazilian population did not have access to the    public sewage systems, and 23.9% to water supply systems. The Southeast, South    and Center-Western parts of the country are better off &#151; 84.6%, 80.3% and    77.9% of the population are served by water supply systems, and 63.6%, 26.1%    and 33.1% by public sewage systems. Lower indexes are to be found in the Northeast    and North, where only 63.9% e 51.9% are served by water supply systems, and    17.7% and 2.8% served by the public sewage systems (IBGE, 2000). </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>5. S&atilde;o    Paulo: Metropolitan urbanization, spatial segregation, watershed degradation    and public responses&#160; </B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The S&atilde;o    Paulo Metropolitan Region is formed by S&atilde;o Paulo City with around 10    million inhabitants and 38 surrounding municipalities with around 8 million    inhabitants&#160; &#150; making it one of the world's largest cities (IBGE,    2000). During the 1990s, the population growth rate of 1.6% per annum was close    to the rate of natural increase, so there was no net in-migration. There is    an undergoing process of economic transition in the region, from an industry    based economy to a services economy. The metropolitan pattern of urbanization    shows processes of expansion, transformation and modernization of the intra-urban    spaces what actually means poorer living standards to a significant part of    its population.&#160; Much of this has been driven by the difficulty faced by    low-income groups&#160;to have access to housing in safe and adequate areas.&#160;    The metropolitan region appears more and more as a dual space, with social and    environmental differences increasing between the formal city which concentrates    public investments and the informal city which is excluded from most of these    investments.&#160; </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Urban expansion    has led to a concentration of low-income population in peripheral areas, much    of it near water sources that are meant to be protected by the Watershed Protection    Act of 1976.&#160; This law was crafted to protect S&atilde;o Paulo's water    resources, from a command and control point of view of the metropolitan development    along the North-South axis, as well as through planning the land use and occupation&#160;in    the watersheds.&#160; It defined protected areas as much as 54% of all Metropolitan    Region's area and established standards for land occupation and use in these    areas.&#160; Thus, 27 out of the 39 municipalities are totally or partially    within this protected area and 17 have more than half their territory in such    areas.&#160; The metropolitan area lies almost entirely within the physical    limits of the Alto Tiet&ecirc; watershed; in fact, all municipalities in S&atilde;o    Paulo Metropolitan Region are included, in whole or in part, in this watershed.    However, the legislation in itself wasn't enough to hold back disorderly urban    expansion in protected areas. Indeed, it facilitated the consolidation of precarious    urban settlements there that lacked provision for water, sanitation, drainage    and solid waste collection and other infrastructure, thus contributing to the    degradation of water resources. This generated not only a chaotic land use and    occupation but also motivated a decrease in land prices.&#160; These areas became    attractive for the population historically excluded from the formal market;    and today hold more than one million inhabitants.&#160; </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The difficulty    in implementing effective mechanisms to protect these areas makes them susceptible    from market forces, especially from real state sector. This&#160;situation is    worsened by the intense conflicts over land use and occupation, with increasing    processes of occupation by irregular activities, such as <I>favelas</I> (squatter    settlements) and illegal subdivision of plots.&#160; This contributes to the    worsening of conditions of social vulnerability and creates areas with some    of the lowest indicators of public services. It also endangers the water sources    that ensure water supplies for the metropolis, especially those where there    is already intense occupation and the quality of water is compromised as in    the two largest reservoirs; and where the threat of urban growth is imminent.&#160;    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was not before    1997, when a piece of legislation was approved by the Legislative Assembly of    the State of S&atilde;o Paulo, that efforts aimed at making the actions of watershed    protection and preservation compatible with environmental protection started    to pay off. It also sought to promote the use and occupation of land and the    socio-economic development of protected areas, through the establishment of    general guidelines for the areas of protection and recovery that must be regulated    in all the watershed areas.&#160; The new Watershed Protection Legislation (1997)    has improvements in comparison to the previous legislation of 1978 since it    approaches water management more from a broader perspective and integrates it    with the issue of land management.&#160; Furthermore, it allows the particularities    of each watershed to be taken into account during the processes of planning,    which necessarily involve the participation of the different stakeholders.&#160;    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The main new issue    in the 1997 legislation is the guiding principle of supporting community management    to resolve conflicts of interests, instead of simply prohibiting the occupation    of watershed areas.&#160; This new proposal for management includes, apart from    the State, municipalities and civil society through watershed committees.&#160;    The bill has three basic principles:&#160; the management by river basin or    watershed as the unit of reference, the decentralized, participatory and integrated    management (co-management of the water resources) and the need to establish    mechanisms to charge user fees. It enables intervention in irregularly occupied    areas, providing the inhabitants with infrastructure. Responsibility for the    control of the protected area rests with the State Government due to the high    degree of generality of the Watershed Protection Legislation.&#160; However,    final responsibility rests with each municipality since it must regulate the    use and occupation of land, and this confronts the two legislations.&#160; If    the area is not regulated, the municipality may neither collect taxes nor provide    any kind of urban infrastructure.&#160; The revision of the Watershed Protection    Legislation that is being regulated in the municipalities proposes a tripartite    management for the legalization of the area, involving the State Government,    civil society and the Mayors of the municipalities, and this should join all    the sectors together with the aim of overcoming the problems of illegal occupation.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Approximately 1.3    million people live in areas included in the Watershed Protection Legislation.    Around 95% of the water collected in the watershed of the S&atilde;o Paulo Metropolitan    Region itself (Alto Tiet&ecirc; Watershed) is not in totally protected areas,    and the control over the watersheds of the water producing systems depends on    the policies of land use and occupation as well as on adequate processes of    management that exercise an efficient control. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>6. Qualitative    Changes in the Management of Water Provision in the region; the role of the    new institutional engineering</B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the S&atilde;o    Paulo Metropolitan Area, the policy adopted to address the seriousness of water    quality and quantity problems was based on the land management of watershed    areas characterized by the urban occupation and poverty.&#160; In the absence    of a more integrated system of urban/metropolitan institutional development,    jurisdiction over the land use and occupation was to be articulated with the    related legislations of each municipality. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Alto Tiet&ecirc;    watershed is composed of five sub-basins and three major water systems, detailed    above, and consumes much more water than it produces (31 m<SUP>3 </SUP>/s) out    of the 63.1 m<SUP>3</SUP>/s used for public provision, are imported from neighbouring    watersheds). The watershed occupies just 2.7% of S&atilde;o Paulo State territory    but it concentrates almost half of its total population.&#160; It has a very    complex hydraulic and hydrological regime as a consequence of all transformations    caused by the process of intense urbanization.&#160; </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Alto Tiet&ecirc;    Watershed Committee was created by State Law 7663/91, and it was set up in December,    1994.&#160; The Committee is formed by representatives of the State, of the    36 municipalities in the watershed and civil society entities. The Plenary of    the Committee has 48 members, 16 from each group.&#160; As from 1997, the Committee    extended its structure and five subcommittees were created.&#160; The duties    of the Committee include the creation of management mechanisms for the operation    of the Committee itself. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact that many    problems have worsened throughout the years and many have become critical,&#160;the    difficulties in establishing&#160;priorities for action also increase. The challenges    of this new system based on a democratic and decentralized management are very    complex and not easily solved in the short term. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is clear that    the problems associated with the management of water resources in the Alto Tiet&ecirc;    watershed largely exceed the capacity of the water institutions to solve them,    especially the problems that arise from the process of uncontrolled growth of    this huge city. The social and regional complexity of the watershed encouraged    the search for solutions that may respond more directly to local concerns. The    creation of subcommittees was meant to help decentralize management and enable    closer proximity to the problems, but it also generated more segmentation in    the process.&#160; The dynamics of the subcommittees is also quite differentiated,    reflecting their differing capacity of organization and mobilization.&#160;    The Watershed Committee reflects a reality where each of the municipalities    has their own particular problems and concerns, what makes cooperation an institution    less likely to occur. The absence of any metropolitan wide policy that seeks    overall and regional solutions significantly limits the committee's capacity.&#160;&#160;    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In spite of the    limits, the committee has turned into one of the few forums of debate in Brazil's    metropolitan areas.&#160; By including representatives from different institutions    and localities around the same group of problems, it extends the possibilities    of articulation.&#160; It has increasingly contributed to greater awareness    among different sectors of society regarding the need for a qualified and consistent    participation by its members.&#160; However, simple facts such as the delay    in agreeing with the necessity of regional waste water system for the collection    treatment of served waters shows some of the flaws in the system. On the other    hand, these sorts of disagreements can be understood as important learning moments    for all stakeholders. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>7. Institutional    performance of watershed committees</B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering the    context of this institutional change, the research (Jacobi et al., 2006) focused    on how this newly and creative institutional settings may contribute to an improvement    in the watershed's overall governance.&#160; The methodological framework adopted    was based on gauging and comparing performance indicators from watersheds studied    during the research. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Watershed committees    are proper arenas for a comparative study of institutional performance and their    relation to cooperative behavior. The actions usually coordinated by these institutions    &#151; preservation of natural resources and land use planning &#151; are activities    that when carried out separately reach, in most of the cases, unsatisfactory    results (MONTEIRO, 2003). Institution's performance should be measured by its    ability to respond to the demands imposed upon them, and also do it effectively.    Evaluation of institutional performance should be comprehensive and not limited    to a few aspects of the organization and the analysis of their activities should    be as broad as possible. The evaluations should be internally coherent, reliable    in the sense of translating the performance of an institution along; and, finally,    should be based upon criteria that are not foreign to the leaders or members    of the institutions being analyzed (PUTNAM, 1993). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of    the institutional performance of watershed committees is structured on four    dimensions: a) <I>decision making process</I> (planning and evaluation); b)    <I>resource management and mobilization</I>; c) <I>internal and external communication    and coordination</I>; and d) <I>conflict resolution mechanisms</I>. The presence    or absence of these features will determine the ability of social groups in    creating, defining and operating under rules agreed upon collectively. A group    that is capable of swiftly executing the activities mentioned above should also    present a better performance in its actions. On the other hand, a group where    collective action is complicated will find it hard to reach its goals and consequently    will have lower institutional performance (UPHOFF, 2000). </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>a- Methodology    </B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the evaluation    of the institutional performance, a structured analysis from the indicators    mentioned above was conducted. Literature (UPHOFF, 2000) indicates that the    analysis of these indicators in an aggregated way allows for a clear and objective    evaluation of social groups performance. Data was collected through a questionnaire    answered by the elected members of five watershed committees.<a name="not1b"></a><a href="#not1"><SUP>1</SUP></a>    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The four categories    of indicators were then combined to form an index of institutional performance    (IP). The index reflects the general member's perception about the activities    carried out collectively by the watershed committee. Indicators were carefully    selected indicators related to the way each group conducts its internal activities.    Observations that are not directly related to the committee's activities are    not considered as the object of institutional performance analysis. Thus, it    does not make sense to include, for example, indicators such as water quality,    since it is subject to a series of actions and interferences that most of the    times do not depend solely upon the committee's activities. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The institutional    performance index allows one to compare the performance of each committee from    a common point of view, which makes the comparison more precise. As already    mentioned, the analysis of the collective perception of these institution's    performance represents a coherent way of making this comparison since it demonstrates    the opinion of stakeholders directly involved with the institution. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To gauge committee's    social capital 117 stakeholders were interviewed - the same sample universe    - in five subcommittees. The main objective was to map the perception of members    as to the following indicators: a) the characteristics of the association or    organization to which the person interviewed belongs; b) trust in other members    and in the committee as an institution; c) reciprocity; and d) cooperation between    the person being interviewed and the other members. A number of alternatives    were defined for each question, varying gradually from a situation that represented    low social capital to the optimum situation for that theme. Each alternative    received a specific value, calculated by dividing the value of each question    by the number of alternatives presented. By adding the value of all the answers    in a questionnaire, we obtained the value of the social capital for that questionnaire.    The sum of the totals of each questionnaire allows for obtaining the absolute    value of the SCI &#151; Social Capital Index for each committee studied. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The elaboration    of the SCI allows for determining how dimensions of human behavior such as associational    life, trust, reciprocity and cooperation are present among committee's members.    </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides the application    of the questionnaire, other activities were developed &#151; the follow-up of    meetings and the regular activities of the so-called technical groups, as well    as informal talks with the representatives of the five sub-committees. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><B>b- Social Capital    and Institutional Performance&#160;&#151; research's results</B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The explanation    for the asymmetries found in the institutional performance of the committees    studied can be sought from the following hypothesis: the social capital of the    watershed committees will positively influence the performance of that organization    (Putnam, 1993). To gauge the social capital of the committees studied we applied    questionnaires with the same sample universe. The main objective was to map    the perception of the members as to the following indicators: a) the characteristics    of the association or organization to which the person interviewed belongs;    b) the trust in the other members and in the committee as an institution; c)    reciprocity; and d) cooperation between the person interviewed and the other    members. Again, a number of alternatives were defined for each question, varying    gradually from a situation that represented low institutional performance to    the optimum situation for that theme. Each alternative received a specific value,    calculated by dividing the value of each question by the number of alternatives    presented. By adding the value of all the answers in a questionnaire, we obtained    the value of the social capital for that questionnaire. The sum of the totals    of each questionnaire allows for obtaining the absolute value of the SCI &#151;    Social Capital Index for each committee studied. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The elaboration    of the SCI allows for determining how dimensions of human behavior such as associational    life, trust, reciprocity and cooperation are present among committee's members.    After data processing, we reached the following result for social capital: SCI    Billings = 21.75 and SCI Guarapiranga = 19.69. Once against we proved the statistical    relevance of this asymmetry by submitting the values to the "t" test, at the    level of 1%. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once demonstrated    the asymmetries in institutional performance and in social capital stocks, we    are able to test our hypothesis and verify how these two variables are related.    <a href="#fig1">Figures 1 to 6</a> show the relation between social capital    and institutional performance in the watershed committees studied. These figures    suggest that there is a positive relation between social capital and institutional    performance in both cases studied. </font></p>     <p><a name="fig1"></a></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v9n2/a02fig01.gif"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><a name="fig2"></a> </p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v9n2/a02fig02.gif"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><a name="fig3"></a></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v9n2/a02fig03.gif"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><a name="fig4"></a></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v9n2/a02fig04.gif"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><a name="fig5"></a></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v9n2/a02fig05.gif"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><a name="fig6"></a></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/asoc/v9n2/a02fig06.gif"></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The correlation    between these two variables in Billings committee is 0.68. For Guarapiranga    the value found was 0.48. Considering the graphs below, it is reasonable to    say that there is a positive relation between the variables. After combining    the five data series, the relation can still be noted, but with a correlation    coefficient of 0,62. Thus, we can say that there is in fact a positive relation    between our independent variable &#151; the social capital, and the dependent    variable &#151; the institutional performance. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The figures that    follow illustrate the positive relation between social capital (independent    variable) and institutional performance in the five watershed committees, indicating    a positive relation. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><B>8 - Conclusions&#160;    </B> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The debate raised    around social capital as a concept that explains the existence of better institutions    should be treated rigorously when transferred to situations such as the one    studied here. Our conceptual and operational formulations about the effects    of social capital in the institutional performance of the watershed committees    have proved that. The idea that certain aspects within social groups do influence    institutional development can only gain strength if we are able to transport    it from a rhetorical to a more elevated level, where these phenomena can be    effectively observed and quantified. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis of    the institutional performance of the watershed committees from a social capital    perspective has proved that there is a positive relation between these variables.    In fact, in the cases studied, the existence of trust, solidarity and disposition    to cooperate among the committee members seem to positively influence the ability    of the group to coordinate its actions. And although the research has mapped    and verified the existence of asymmetries in a specific timeframe, it is reasonable    to assume that these processes are highly path dependent and tend to continue    unaltered. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The study of the    water resource management system from a social networks perspective allows us    to conclude that in the cases studied, the interaction is greater between State    and municipalities, and that the civil society representatives are clearly set    apart from the decision making process. Results proved to be consistent with    field observations. In fact, the civil society, in both cases studied, finds    serious limitations in occupying a position to influence in the decision making    process within the committees. From that comes the verification that the system    has not been able to remain faithful to parity between&#160;all stakeholders.&#160;    Although in some committees the civil society is able to exert greater influence    than in others, the fact is that, in general, this system has not behaved in    a flexible manner regarding the acknowledgement of civil society actions and    propositions. Thus, the dynamics of the watershed committees is highly dictated    by initiatives from the State and municipalities. We are yet to know how far    these two actors are effectively committed to sharing the power over the decisions    that affect the way in which the watershed is managed. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The outcomes show    that the historical, political and social conditionings that allowed the development    of the five subcommittees are differentiated. Those that are more active indicate    very clearly the existence of institutional arrangements between municipalities    of the region, a tradition of participation and engagement of the population    in issues of collective interest. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These findings    strengthen our understanding that scientific research over the conditions that    foster or restrain collective practices, as well as more democratic institutional    arrangements in participatory spaces (AVRITZER, 2002) stress the importance    of deliberative democracy towards a more integrated and democratic environmental    policy. Widening these participatory opportunities improve qualitatively the    representation of interests and the quality and equity of public response to    social demands. These experiences stress out the importance of public participation    within the committees and improve its ability to play a more significant role    in the relationships between State and Civil Society in the domain of water    resources public policies. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even though the    committee's operational dynamics are far from being perfect, it is fair to say    that there is a will to cooperate. The research indicates that all representatives    are willing to reach agreements under a common shared understanding, and the    stronger these behaviors are, the stronger the institutional performance will    be. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some challenges    are yet to be overcome, especially those that deal specifically with the different    mindsets of stakeholders, what implies in hardening conflict resolution through    more deliberative means, based on negotiation on socio-technical premises, where    asymmetries lie on informational resources rather then on economic, social or    political ones. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The focal point    in this whole process is stockholder's liability. Given its inherent complexity    and the early stages where environmental citizenship still finds itself, the    logics of management among committee's members are frequently determined by    technocratic inputs, as main references of the processes control. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is worthy    mentioning is the political innovations brought by this system in the State    &#151; Society relations, since the rules of the game are now more "water use"    driven, and bring back into play a wider number of stakeholders. It also shows    that a widening of public participation and strengthening of deliberative environmental    politics grants access to information resources and improves public response    to social demands. Therefore, social control over water policy is a turning-point    within this new political context, since it forges <I>fora</I> focused on the    necessity to establish partnerships. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These observations    have important consequences. At a moment when water resources draws attention    not only from the news, but mainly in multilateral financing organizations agenda,    one should be aware to verify to what extent the social factors are being satisfactorily    met in these projects. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This allows to    conclude that underestimating the importance of the various social dimensions,    mainly the relational ones, is not an option for those who elaborate public    policies; and that continuing to disrespect the influence that social dynamics    exerts over development is condemning to failure initiatives that were initially    valuable. </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus, it is highly    recommended to those who elaborate public policies and work in the area of water    resource management to take into consideration both the social interactions,    and the roles played by the State, municipalities, and the civil society and    the social networks built by these actors. </font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Note</b> </font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a name="not1"></a><a href="#not1b">1</a>.

Abstract The paper focuses on the arguments of the Neo-roman republicanism to make clear the resemblance to liberalism that the Neo-romans themselves do not explicit recognize. For this the paper focuses in the work of Pettit. Methodologically it focuses in the textual analysis but shows too the temporal transformation of the republican theories. It is argued that the resemblance with Berlin is fixed in its recognition of human relationship that produces the need for a theory of justice contrary to autocracy with which the dialogue is established with Rawls. Next Pettit&#8217;s use of his historical sources is briefly contrasted with Pocock&#8217;s reference to the identification of the republican tradition and shows one internal inconsistency of Pettit&#8217;s theory that brings him closer to important interpretations of the liberalism. The paper concludes that it is not necessary to define Pettit&#8217;s theory as a republican one but it does not invalid it.

Abstract This text deals with the transmission of knowledge and practices between different generations of carnival artists. This activity occupies a central role in the business of entertainment as part of the social and cultural patterns of modernity as experienced in Rio de Janeiro in the late 20th century and early 21st century. This knowledge relies on baroque aesthetic effects and visual excesses and indicates the permanence of what might be called a functional differentiality. At the same time, we see how all this differentiality affects the continuity of a pattern of artistic conduct that emerges amid the continuous changes of interests and ideas in the parade of samba schools.

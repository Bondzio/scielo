Abstract: Focusing on the Commission on the Truth of Black Slavery in Brazil (Cvenb), supported by the Brazilian Bar Association (OAB), I will discuss its creation and the antiracist instruments that guide its performance. I will also present the reflection on the slavery in the context of the Truth Commission (TC) and how its proximity with other historical catastrophe is carried out. I analyse how the Commission interprets multiculturalism and how this understanding confronts the official narrative concerning the concept of the nation, which has been questioned by segments of the Black Movement. The examined material derives from direct observation of the Commission's activities, press material, videos and documents produced by the Commission itselves.

The aim of this article is to understand the evolution and current state of the home rent market in the country by connecting demographic evolution to the dynamics of the rent market. It also intends to contribute to the discussion on the importance of implementing a rent policy in Brazil. Therefore, in its first item, the article analyzes Brazilian population's demographic evolution, positing a few population projection hypotheses. In the second item, about rented housing in Brazil, it shows the evolution in the percentage of rented homes. According to our findings, choosing to rent does not decrease families' income, nor do rented homes have a poor quality; they are more centrally located, dense, and accessible. In the third item, where SÃ£o Paulo's specific case is presented, we verified that rented homes were the predominant form of housing until the 1970's, showing the profile of the city's landlords and tenants.

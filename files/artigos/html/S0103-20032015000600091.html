<p>Since 2008 Portugal began to be influenced by a financial crisis, next in line the
            public budget troubles and a consequential economic crisis. Moreover, after 2011,
            Portugal is under a bailed out program of troika (IMF, EU and ECB). The country has been
            a chronic underachiever, suffering from years of low growths, and since its rescue
            embraced salvation through austerity and structural reforms. Unit labor costs have
            fallen and exports are rising, but not enough to compensate the decrease in domestic
            consumption and investment. Consequently, the recession has been deeper than expected,
            unemployment is forecast to reach 19% in 2013, the gross domestic product (GDP)
            decreased and the debt-to-GDP increased. Credit for small and sized firms is especially
            tight.</p>
<p>In line with the new economic paradigm within the EU, in Portugal is also publicly
            acknowledged that the overcoming of this crisis should be based on the production of
            transactional goods, with the economic growth and development supported on endogenous
            resources, knowledge and innovation, where the agricultural sector deserving a special
            attention.</p>
<p>As the European Commission recognizes one of the restrictions to the European
            agricultural development is rooted in the imbalances in bargaining power between the
            contracting parties in the food supply chain, being committed to promote and facilitate
            the restructuring and consolidation of the agricultural sector by encouraging the
            creation of voluntary agricultural producer organization. To support the policy making
            process, DG Agriculture and Rural Development has launched a large study<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> "Support for Farmers' Cooperatives" that provides
            insights on successful cooperatives and producer organizations as well as on effective
            support measure (<sup><a href="#B2">BIJMAN et al., 2012</a></sup>).</p>
<p>The economic role of cooperatives and its position in the food chain needs to be
            understood in a context where today's agro-food markets are characterized by: thinner
            margins, greater price and income volatility due to reduced government involvement and
            international competition; a trend to fewer, larger and more specialized farms, fewer
            agribusiness firms; innovative products with a shorter life cycle; food consumption
            increasingly shaped by demands for variety, convenience, food safety and environment
            friendly; enormous concentration in the final market of consumers; the increasing
            importance of the role played by information and commercialization technologies (e.g.,
            e-commerce). Despite these changes in market structure and dynamics, with dominance of
            the demand over the supply, agricultural raw material markets are characterized by
            vertical coordination, in a way where players (farmers and marketing/processors) engage
            in a "coopetition", in which all cooperate in the creation of value added, while
            subsequently competing over its distribution.</p>
<p>Using the theoretical framework suggested in <sup><a href="#B2">Bijman et
               al. (2012</a></sup>), that the performance of cooperatives in agro-food chains is
            related with (a) the position in the food supply chain, (b) the internal governance and
            (c) the institutional environment, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the
            economic role of the Portuguese agricultural marketing cooperatives. To achieve this
            objective, in addition to this introduction (section 1) and the conclusion (section 5),
            the paper includes an overview of the Portuguese agricultural sector (section 2), the
            typology of Portuguese cooperatives and position in the agro food chain (section 3), the
            institutional environment, internal governance and performance of the agricultural

<p>Table 1 includes indicators that show the evolution of the Portuguese economy and
               agricultural sector during the last decade. Since 2007, the Portuguese economy
               witnesses a poor performance, with a tendency to worsen. During the 2007-2011 period,
               the GDP decreased 0.7%, the unemployment increased, reaching almost 13% in 2011; the
               private consumption and investment decreased and the public debt strongly increased,
               reaching 107.8% of the GDP in 2012, as a result of repeated annual public deficits.
               Only the exports, excluding the years of 2008 and 2009, had an opposite behavior,
               with a good performance in 2010 and 2011.</p>

            </p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2011, the primary sector (agriculture, forestry and fisheries)
               presents an erratic performance, with poor performances in 2007 and 2009 and good
               ones in the remaining years. The year of 2011 witnessed the highest performance,
               expressed through the positive GVA growth of 2.8%, while the Portuguese GDP decreased
               1.7%.</p>
<p>The agro-forestry complex represents roughly 5.5% of the Portuguese GDP and 12.1% of
               the country employment while the agricultural sector (agriculture + agro-food
               industries) represents, respectively, 3.7% and 8.1%. Furthermore, during the last
               decade (<sup><a href="#B4">GPP, 2012</a></sup>) the sector presents the
               following results: slight increase in total agricultural production, in volume;
               preponderance of vegetable production (52%) over the animal production (43%), a
               stronger difference in terms of added values (84% e 16%, respectively); high
               concentration of the production in the horticulture, fruits, wine and milk sectors;
               an agricultural labor productivity growth, at a rate higher than that registered in
               the economy as a whole, due to an abrupt reduction of small farms, technological
               improvements (catching-up effect) and a better use of the available resources
               (technical efficiency).</p>
<p>Based on the results of the Agricultural Census of 2009, <sup><a href="#B5">INE (2011</a></sup>) summarizes the main trends for the Portuguese farming
               structure and agricultural system between 1999 and 2009 as follows:</p>
<p>

            </p>
<p>
               <blockquote><p>UAA increased more than, roughly, 2.5 ha, from an average of 9.3 ha to 12 ha,

                     ones;</p></blockquote>
            </p>
<p>
               <blockquote><p>The number of holdings (as a legal entity of agricultural enterprises) grew
                     23%, and 27% of the UAA is managed by them;</p></blockquote>
            </p>
<p>
               <blockquote><p>A change in the agricultural landscape, with permanent pasture occupying almost

<a name="idp2547984"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Typology</p>
<p>The Portuguese Cooperative Movement has its roots in the 19th century, although its
               expansion and deployment was very limited until 1974 (<sup><a href="#B7">NAMORADO, 1999</a></sup>). During the Constitutional Monarchy, overthrown in 1910,
               the Portuguese Cooperative Movement was incipient and clearly rooted in the labour
               movement. During the 1st Republic, from 1910 to 1926, cooperatives were doctrinally
               oriented, but this orientation did not result in consistent public policies.</p>
<p>During the dictatorship period, between 1926 and 1974, the political power was
               generically hostile to cooperatives. However, the economic failure of the corporative
               regime concerning the agricultural sector, led government to encourage agricultural
               cooperative development in a top-down strategy, strongly supervised by the political
               power. This positioning is clearly expressed in the <em>Plano de Fomento</em>
               for wine (<sup><a href="#B16">TEIXEIRA, 2001</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B8">REBELO et al., 2002</a></sup>), milk/dairy, olive oil and
               fruit cooperatives, in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>An important consequence of the democratic revolution of April 25th in 1974 for
               agricultural cooperatives was the conquest of freedom that led, from this date on, to
               a strong cooperative expansion both in terms of the number of cooperative members and
               of the sectors in which they became involved. However, after this expansion, that
               lasted until the mid-1980s a period of significant cooperative failures occurred,
               particularly in industries characterised by intense market competition (e.g., the
               agri-food sector).</p>
<p>In 1980, the Cooperative Code (CC) was passed. The current law is the result of an
               amendment enacted in 1996 (Law n. 51/96 from September 7). Since 1998, a Cooperative
               Fiscal Statute (Law nº 95/98 from December, 16) exists establishing a specific and
               a-priori favourable tax regime for cooperatives, comparatively to private firms
               (exemption of tax on net surplus, excluding the net profits from transactions with
               third parties, and local tax exemption on real estate). In 2012, this autonomous and
               specific Cooperative Fiscal Statute became part of the Fiscal Benefits Statute, with
               a specific article on cooperatives (article 66-A), but the "fundamental matrix" of
               fiscal support was maintained.</p>
<p>In addition to primary cooperatives and secondary cooperatives, the CC contemplates
               the existence of federations and confederations of cooperatives. Presently<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> 22 federations and 2 confederations of
               cooperatives are active. Six federations are present in the agricultural sector:
               Fenadegas (wine), Fenafrutas (fruit and vegetables), Fenalac (milk), Fenazeites
               (olive oil) Fenca (production), Fenagro (supply inputs) and, at a higher level two
               large confederations: Confagri (agricultural and forestry sectors and agricultural
               credit) and Confecoop (all the other sectors where cooperatives are involved). Since
               the 1st Congress of the Portuguese Cooperatives, in 1999, these confederations are
               collaborating under an Inter-cooperative Forum.</p>
<p>In their organization and operation, the Portuguese cooperatives observe (comply
               with) the following cooperative principles, that are an integral part of the
               declaration on the cooperative identity adopted by the International Cooperative
               Alliance (ICA): voluntary and open membership; democratic member control; members'
               economic participation; autonomy and independence; education, training and
               information; cooperation among cooperatives; and concern for the community.</p>
<p>Primary cooperatives only accept as members<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>,
               individuals or firms that have transactions with the cooperative (user-owners) and,
               in its core, they follow the model that in the literature is known as "traditional
               cooperative", where equity is mainly financed through by member contributions and net
               surplus (benefits) retained by decision of the general assembly.</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the number of cooperatives, by branch, in Portugal in 2000 and 2010.
               The total number of cooperatives in 2010 is 3,108, an increase of 4.5% relatively to
               2000. By branch, agricultural cooperatives are predominant (31.6% in 2000 and 28.9%
               in 2010) followed by housing and construction and services. Comparing the
               cooperatives branches that provide public or quasi-public goods (handicraft, culture,
               education, services and social solidarity) with those that compete with IOFs in the
               market (agricultural, trade, consumption, credit, fishing and production workers), we
               observe that, in the last decade, the number of the former increased, while the
               opposite occurred in the latter case.</p>

<p>Detailed information about the quantities of agricultural products marketed through
               cooperative firms is scarce (<sup><a href="#B3">COGECA, 2010</a></sup>).
               However, we can say that, in order of importance, they play a relevant role in the
               chains of dairy (milk), wine, olive oil and fruit and vegetables. Despite this
               importance, there are few studies either on the cooperative sector as a whole or on
               particular aspects of agricultural cooperatives. The market share of cooperatives in
               the dairy, fruit and vegetables, wine, and olive oil food chains, in 2009, was 70%,
               25%, 42% and 30%, respectively (<a href="#t3">Table 3</a>).</p>

</div>
            </p>
<p>In the food chain (<sup><a href="#B13">REBELO and CALDAS, 2012</a></sup>)
               the 5 largest agricultural cooperatives belong to the dairy/milk sector. Excluding
               agricultural supply cooperatives, and in terms of processing/marketing, in descending
               order, emerge the cooperatives in the wine, fruit and vegetables and olive oil
               sectors.</p>
<p>In the dairy/milk sector, during the last 20 years, milk cooperatives won a dominant
               position (<sup><a href="#B1">ADC, 2010</a></sup>). Almost 2/3 of the raw
               milk is collected and processed by cooperatives. They also detained 2/3 of the
               domestic UHT milk market, owning well-known brands, 1/3 of the butter and also a good
               position in the high added value products (cheese and yoghurts). About 95% of the
               products processed by cooperatives are sold in the domestic market or exported to
               Portuguese speaking countries (i.e., Angola, Mozambique and Cape Verde).</p>
<p>In the wine sector, cooperatives process about 40% of domestic production, but lost
               their market share during the last 20 years to IOFs, namely to grape growers who are
               also processors and bottlers. Although there are some well-known brands of
               cooperative wines (e.g. <em>Muralhas</em> and <em>Porta da
                  Ravessa</em>), in general, they are present in the low consumer market
               segment. In terms of international trade, Port wine (<sup><a href="#B13">REBELO and CALDAS, 2013</a></sup>) has an important contribution to wine exports,
               representing, in 2008, 26% of the quantity and 53% of the value of wine exported,
               being the price of Port wine more than double of the price of still wines. However,
               in the last decade emerged a set of Portuguese wines highly rated and awarded in
               international contests, magazines and newspapers (<sup><a href="#B12">REBELO and MHUR, 2012</a></sup>), produced by small and medium enterprises, in
               addition to the classical brands of Porto wine (e.g. <em>Sandeman</em>) and
               table wine (e.g., <em>Mateus Rosé</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, in the olive oil sector, cooperatives have been losing their market share.
               This means that the increased production from the new olive tree plantations, in the
               southern part of Portugal (Alentejo), was mainly absorbed by investor owned firms
               (IOFs). The olive cooperatives sold more than 50% of their production in bulk to
               packagers/traders while bottled a large part under the brand of the buyer (BOB). The
               most famous olive oil brands (<em>Gallo</em>, <em>Olveira da
                  Serra</em> and <em>Andorinha</em>), are marketed by IOFs. In recent
               years, these firms are adopting strategies of upstream vertical integration, adding
               to marketing the production and processing of olive oil. This product is essentially
               sold in the domestic market. Brazil, followed by Angola, is the main export
               market.</p>
<p>In the fruits and vegetables sector the situation is heterogeneous. For fruits
               (mainly apples and pears) that need a long period of stocking/conservation in cold
               facilities, cooperatives hold a 30% market share of the domestic production; but in
               the processed fruits and fresh vegetables markets they are almost absent.</p>
<p>With respect to fruit cooperatives it is important to highlight that two generations
               of cooperatives presently exist: the first generation was founded in the 1950s and
               1960s by a large number of culturally/socially heterogeneous farmers, whose mission
               was mainly to solve the problems of farmers' production, without a clear marketing
               strategy; the second generation was founded during the last 20 years by homogeneous
               small groups of farmers with a well-defined marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Although the main market for fruits and vegetables continues to be the domestic
               market, exports are witnessing an increase in the last years.</p>

<a name="idp2594864"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Institutional environment</p>
<p>The development of Portuguese agricultural cooperatives is strongly related to the
               evolution of the political system during the last century, in three distinct periods:
               the "first republic" period, between 1910 and 1926, characterized by strong social
               convulsions and political instability, is responsible for the emergence of consumer
               cooperatives; the "dictatorship regime" period, between 1926 and 1974, is
               characterized by the promotion of agricultural cooperatives in a top-down process and
               public control; and since 1974 the "democratic regime" period created the conditions
               to the free foundation of cooperatives, but without high public support.</p>
<p>In their foundation, organization and governance, agricultural cooperatives are
               required to follow the legal framework presented in the CC and the specific laws
               relative to each "branch" that complete and develop the CC. In comparison to IOFs,
               agricultural cooperatives are exempt from corporate tax (IRC) and local taxes related
               to acquiring property assets. The VAT incident on deliveries made by members is also
               exempt, being chargeable only when the final price is paid.</p>
<p>Research on agricultural wine cooperatives (<sup><a href="#B16">TEIXEIRA,
                  2001</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B10">REBELO et al., 2010</a></sup>) allows us
               to conclude that Portuguese farmers became members of processing/marketing
               cooperatives, not only to obtain economic benefits (price received by the product
               delivered to the cooperative), but also according to their social characteristics
               (size of the farms, level of education, age). The results achieved by those authors
               indicate that in wine cooperatives<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> members own
               small farms (about 1.6 hectare/farm); roughly 80% of farmers have just primary
               education; and in age terms, only 12% are less than 40 years old and 45% over 60
               years old. To overcome the restrictions of the traditional cooperative model, namely
               the ill definition of property rights, with the inherent problems of free-rider and
               preference of short time horizon, during the last decade, in the fruit and vegetables
               sector, production organizations were founded, under the legal regime of private
               firms or cooperatives, by a small group of homogeneous members.</p>
<p>The agricultural sector as a whole and agricultural cooperatives in particular, are
               under the umbrella of the competition law that is applied to other sectors. However,
               according to article 2nd of the EC Regulation No 1184/2006 of April 27th, there are
               exceptions to the general rules of competition, namely: agreements, decisions and
               practices integrated in the national market organizations; agreements, decisions and
               practices that will be needed to satisfy the objectives of the CAP; some agreements
               between farmers or associations of farmers that belong to a single Member State,
               since these agreements have no influence on prices, do not affect competition and do
               not jeopardise CAP objectives.</p>
<p>Assuming that agricultural markets are becoming increasingly global and competitive,
               and that farmers are rational economic agents that try to maximize their own wealth,
               the loss of market share by cooperatives (other than milk) is an indicator that the
               structural conditions of Portuguese agriculture and the institutional environment,
               have not been enough attractive to adopt the cooperative model over the other forms
               of vertical coordination (spot market, contract farming, quasi integration or
               ownership integration).</p>
<p>Relatively to public intervention in the cooperative sector, <sup><a href="#B14">Rodrigues (2010</a></sup>, p. 840) maintains that:</p>
<p>
               <blockquote><p>"We had two periods of close relation between the cooperative sector and the
                     political power: 1980/1982 and 1995/1997. In the last 10 years it is obvious
                     that the government did not consider this sector relevant".</p></blockquote>
            </p>

<a name="idp2609104"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Internal governance</p>
<p>In their internal governance, cooperatives follow the rules established by the CC
               from 1996, a Parliament law applicable to all kinds of cooperatives. However, the
               first specific law for cooperatives was established in 1982.</p>
<p>The article 39º of the CC defines as mandatory governance bodies of cooperatives: a)
               the general assembly; b) the board of directors (BoD); c) the supervisory board. The
               statutes may still provide other bodies, as well as give power to the general
               assembly or to the BoD to create special committees, of limited duration, in order to
               perform specific tasks.</p>
<p>Consequently, Portuguese agricultural cooperatives are structured in a two
               tier-system (<sup><a href="#B14">RODRIGUES, 2010</a></sup>). The secondary
               cooperatives, federations and confederations of cooperatives (article 84º of the CC)
               adopt a one-tier system if the number of members of the General Assembly is not
               sufficient to fulfill the positions in the governance bodies. In this case, there
               will be only a collegiate body, the Assembly of Cooperatives, composed by all
               members, acting by simple majority, bearing in mind the number of votes that each
               member is assigned by the Statutes.</p>
<p>The governance bodies of agricultural cooperatives are composed only by members (BoD,
               supervisory board and president and vice-president of the general assembly). The
               members of the bodies are elected among members for a four-year term, unless a
               shorter period is specified in the bylaws. The BoD has at least three members, but
               cooperative bylaws may stipulate a higher (odd) number. By this reason, in some
               cooperatives the board of directors is composed by five members. The BoD can delegate
               some of its functions to a manager. The supervisory board is composed of three
               members (or a higher odd number). The members of these bodies can be remunerated as
               stipulated by the general assembly, if not forbidden by the bylaws. The majority of
               the cooperatives do not have professional BoD and/or managers (<sup><a href="#B10">REBELO et al., 2010</a></sup>).</p>
<p>In the decision-making process, the democratic principle of "one member, one vote"
               (article 51º of the CC) is adopted by primary cooperatives. However, there exist two
               exceptions: cooperatives whose members are exclusively other cooperatives; secondary
               cooperatives, federations and confederations. In these cases (article 83º of the CC),
               the bylaws may attribute to each cooperative member a certain number of votes, both
               as a function of the number of their members or according to other explicitly stated
               criteria that, in the context of the democratic principle, receives the approbation
               of the majority of the members. Some secondary cooperatives adopt a voting rule based
               in the number of members and in the quantity of product delivered by each associated
               cooperative.</p>
<p>The Portuguese agricultural cooperatives follow the traditional cooperative
               principles (i.e., open membership, democratic control, restricted residual claim and
               benefit to members proportional to patronage), with poorly defined property rights
               and the inherent difficulty in assuming risky investments that could add value in the
               medium and long run. Additionally, the smaller ones follow the so-called
               "Mediterranean model" of governance, characterised by the adoption of the traditional
               principles and a non-professional management (<sup><a href="#B10">REBELO
                  et al., 2010</a></sup>). To the question "Is the traditional governance cooperative
               model, imposed by the CC, a strong restriction to the competition and development of
               long run entrepreneurial strategies", the answers of cooperative leaders are not
               unanimous. For cooperatives well positioned in the agri-food chain and with low
               leverage levels, the compliance of the CC rules is not a relevant restriction, but
               other solutions/models are acceptable; the inverse position is expressed by
               cooperatives with a high leverage, bad positioned in the market and experiencing
               problems in attracting members/patrons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<a name="idp2622176"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sub-subsec">Performance</p>
<p>The choice of the appropriate indicator to measure cooperative performance depends on
               the situation of the stakeholders in the cooperative (e.g., member, manager).
               Members' perspective (<sup><a href="#B8">REBELO et al., 2002</a></sup>) on
               the cooperatives' role can be better explained by answering the following questions:
               (a) why do farmers want to vertically integrate? (b) why do farmers want/need to
               integrate jointly rather than individually? In a processing cooperative, the sources
               of benefits are: scale and scope economies and/or increasing efficiency in assembling
               and processing raw farm products; elimination of market failures; countervailing
               market power; farm risk management through pooling or contract arrangement; lower
               transaction costs in comparison with alternative forms of vertical integration.</p>
<p>A cooperative will only be efficient if its members/patrons are able to get higher
               net economic benefits (final price of the product delivered, time of receipt,
               provided runoff, risk sharing), than through other alternative forms of vertical
               integration. Since investor-members are not permitted in Portugal, members' behaviour
               relative to their own cooperative is mainly related to the final price (patronage
               refund) of the product delivered. Research on the wine cooperative sector (<sup><a href="#B16">TEIXEIRA, 2001</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B8">REBELO et al., 2002</a></sup>; <sup><a href="#B9">REBELO et al.,
                  2008</a></sup>) indicates that it is usual for members to exhibit an individualistic
               and free-riding behavior.</p>
<p>
               <sup><a href="#B15">Soboh et al. (2009</a></sup>) present a vast review of
               the theoretical and empirical economic literature on the performance of agricultural
               marketing cooperatives. They conclude that empirical studies have failed to address
               cooperative objectives as represented by the theoretical literature.</p>
<p>
               <sup><a href="#B10">Rebelo et al. (2010</a></sup>) applied an econometric
               model with the goal of checking the performance of the Portuguese Douro Wine
               cooperatives using two alternative indicators of performance, according to the
               objective pursed: if the cooperative objective is to maximize the short run financial
               benefits to members, the patronage refund rate (patronage refund divided by gross
               revenue) is an appropriate performance indicator; on the other hand, the equity/total
               asset ratio may be a more appropriate performance indicator for professional
               managers, to who is preferable a capital structure that favors equity accumulation.
               Based on the econometric model results, the authors concluded that, according to the
               theoretical framework, the governance structure has opposite effects on the
               indicators of performance: when full time directors have bargaining power,
               cooperatives transfer less revenue to members and try to decrease leverage. These
               results reinforce the belief that cooperatives structured differently have different
               and conflicting stakeholder interests. Cooperatives with non-professional management
               tend to maximize annual revenues from the raw materials delivered; cooperatives with
               professional directors/managers seek to reinforce equity, with a risk minimizing
               strategy.</p>
<p>Using as performance indicators the position in the food chain and financial
               indicators (total assets, equity, and leverage) of the top five agricultural
               cooperative per sector (<sup><a href="#B12">REBELO and CALDAS,
                  2012</a></sup>) it is possible to infer that: milk cooperatives, essentially those
               located in the Portuguese mainland, present a better and higher performance; in the
               other sectors the situation is heterogeneous and not so clear, with some cooperatives
               with high levels of leverage.</p>
<p>Since agricultural cooperatives are located in the core of the food chain, between
               production and marketing, their efficiency depends on what is occurring upstream
               (supply) and downstream (demand). The agricultural cooperatives' efficiency is
               influenced by the social and economic structure of agricultural producers located
               upstream in the <em>filière</em> that, in the case of Portugal, is
               characterized as being heterogeneous, atomized, aged, risk averse and with a low
               educational level. Thus, the most efficient cooperatives are in the sectors in which
               these weaknesses have been overcome (as is the case of milk and some fruit
               cooperatives) and also in those that assumed a business approach, with strong
               leadership, well defined business strategies and an efficient structure, both in
               human and physical resources and organization.</p>
<p>On the demand side, cooperatives face a commercial distribution that is increasingly
               strong and concentrated. As stated in <sup><a href="#B1">AdC
               (2010</a></sup>): in 2008 the nine largest retail groups, held a share of almost 85% of
               the total value of sales in food retail, holding the largest two groups,
               approximately, 45% (p. 10); four areas were identified where the bargaining
               imbalances between distributors and suppliers are clearly relevant (p. 16): (i)
               unilateral imposition of conditions (i. e., negotiation of a typical contract); (ii)
               discounts and other inducements; (iii) penalties; and (iv) payment times. Although
               these practices do not contravene the EU and Portuguese legislation on competition,
               in the absence of a clear abuse of market power, have negative repercussions on sales
               prices, which, at the end, affect the prices paid to agricultural producers.</p>

<a name="idp2651712"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="sec">Conclusion</p>
<p>Agricultural cooperatives are an upstream and/or downstream extension of agricultural
            activities and their evolution reflects, and it is a consequence, of the structural
            transformations occurred in Portuguese agriculture.</p>
<p>The Portuguese agricultural cooperative movement gained relevance in 1960s, as an answer
            to market failures. As the agricultural markets are becoming increasingly global and
            competitive, the loss of market share by cooperatives (other than milk) is an indicator
            that the structural conditions of Portuguese agriculture and the institutional
            environment, have not been enough attractive to adopt the cooperative model over the
            other forms of vertical coordination (spot market, contract farming, quasi integration,
            or ownership integration).</p>
<p>There are different factors that explain the economic performance of Portuguese
            agricultural cooperatives, namely the socio-economic characteristics of members and
            leadership. The obligation of cooperatives to follow the legal framework contemplated in
            the CC and the lack of flexibility of the governance model, are cited as barriers to the
            competitiveness of cooperatives, particularly to the oldest ones, with a large and
            heterogeneous membership (in economic, social and cultural terms).</p>
<p>Consequently the legal framework needs to be revised to allow cooperatives to evolve
            into a new generation of cooperatives<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>
            (proportional investment cooperatives, member investor cooperatives, cooperatives with
            capital-seeking entities), as pointed out by cooperative´ stakeholders. Although the
            adoption of a new cooperative model, as alternative to the traditional one, is
            important, it is not the panacea for the structural illnesses of Portuguese agriculture
            (atomized, reduced innovation, low productivity, aged farmers, low educational level and
            risk averse). The legal emergence of these new models would provide a wider range of
            options in solving some of the current problems in the sector.</p>
<p>Overall, if the policy objectives are to maintain a high number of small producers in
            the agri-food chain, especially in peripheral regions, it is important to secure the
            existence of economically strong agricultural cooperatives, able to face a global demand
            and the increasing market power of larger retailers. Hence, a specific financial
            envelope must be defined for cooperatives, including integrated support for material and
            immaterial investments for their technical conversion and size increase (scale
            economies), changes in the structure of property rights, professionalization of
            management, staff training, technical support to associates and marketing
            strategies.</p>

<a name="fn5"></a><p><sup>5</sup>The article 6 of the CC also considers as cooperatives the <em>regies</em> or
               cooperatives of public interest, characterized by government participation or other
               legal persons governed by public law, as well as, jointly or separately, cooperatives

<a name="fn6"></a><p><sup>6</sup>The qualitative information collected while preparing Rebelo and Caldas (2012),
               supports the conclusion that the situation is similar in the other traditional
               cooperative sectors, namely in olive oil and fruits and less in dairy/milk. </p>

<a name="fn7"></a><div class="fn">
<a name="fn7"></a><p><sup>7</sup>Somehow, the milk sector solved this problem by adopting a pyramid model, with the
               first degree cooperatives aggregating the producers, secondary cooperatives in the
               intermediate stage and a private commercial company (Lactogal, SA), at the top of the
               pyramid, owned in equal shares by three cooperatives (Lacticoop, Agros and Proleite).
               At the same time they were able to constitute a strong business group. This process
               was supported by a strategic vision and a strong and sustained leadership. </p>

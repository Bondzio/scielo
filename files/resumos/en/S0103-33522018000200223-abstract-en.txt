Abstract This paper presents an exploratory descriptive and inferential study about the political representation of people with disabilities in the Chamber of Deputies, based on a websurvey with 562 subjects. Statistical tests of hypotheses were performed based on the correlation between the answers obtained and chi-square tests. With regard to the represented, it was concluded that the monitoring of the activities of the parliamentarians is capable of producing difference in the evaluation of representation. In addition, variables such as schooling, income and party affiliation showed different nuances in the opinions about the scenario of political representation. Finally, participation in debates or in civil society associations and organizations has shown potential to modify the assessments of people with disabilities on political representation.

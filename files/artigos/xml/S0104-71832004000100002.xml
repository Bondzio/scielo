If so, what would it look like? I will attempt a provisional    answer here, building on a recent book about the consequences of the digital    revolution for the forms of money and exchange (Hart, 2001). People, machines    and money matter in this world, in that order. Most intellectuals know very    little about any of them, being preoccupied with their own production of cultural    ideas. Anthropologists have made some progress towards understanding people,    but they are often in denial when it comes to the other two; and their methods    for studying people have been trapped for too long in the 20<sup>th</sup> century    paradigm of fieldwork-based ethnography. I do not advocate a wholesale rejection    of the ethnographic tradition, but rather would extend its premises towards    a more inclusive anthropological project, better suited to studying world society,    of which the internet is perhaps the most striking expression. For sure, we    need to find out what real people do and think by joining them where they live.    But we also need a global perspective on humanity as a whole if we wish to understand    our moment in history. This will expose the limitations of the modern experiment    in the social sciences - their addiction to impersonal abstractions and suppression    of individual subjectivity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Even more    than before, an anthropology of the internet relies on auto-ethnography, on    fieldwork as personal experience. We each enter it through a unique trajectory.    The world constituted by this "network of networks" does not exist out there,    independently of our own individual experience of it. Nor is the internet "the    world", but rather an online world to which we all bring the particulars of    our place in society offline. In reaching for the human meaning of the internet,    we need to combine introspection and personal judgment with comparative ethnography    and world history. Each of us embarks on a journey outward into the world and    inward into the self. We are, as Durkheim (1965) said, at once collective and    individual. Society is mysterious to us because we have lived in it and it now    dwells inside us at a level that is not ordinarily visible from the perspective    of everyday life. Writing is one way we try to bring the two into some mutual    understanding that we can share with others. Ethnographic fieldwork, requiring    us to participate in local society as we observe it, adds to our range of social    experience, becomes an aspect of our socialization, brings lived society into    our sources of introspection. It is feasible for some individuals to leave different    social experiences in separate compartments; but one method for understanding    world society would be to make an ongoing practice of trying to synthesize these    varied experiences. If a person would have an identity, would be one thing,    oneself, this entails an attempt to integrate all the fragments of social experience    into a more coherent whole, a world in other words, as singular as the self    (Hart, 2003).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">So there    are as many worlds as there are individuals and their journeys; and, even if    there were only one out there, each of us changes it whenever we make a move.    This model of Kantian subjectivity, at once personal and cosmopolitan, should    be our starting point; but it will not do for the study of world society. Accordingly,    I begin with an account of the internet seen in world-historical perspective    - its origins and political economy - before turning to the dialectics of the    virtual and the real that frame our personal journey through cyberspace. Here    I will draw on Heidegger's metaphysics, before turning in conclusion to Kant's    great example as a source for the possible renewal of the intellectual discipline    he named (Kant, 1977).</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The origins    of the internet</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Communication    is a word cognate with common and community. It appears to have its root in    the ability of a group or network of people to exchange things and ideas through    interaction. This usually takes the form either of the circulation of material    objects by means of money or the exchange of signs by means of language. The    first of these is the main topic of <i>Money in an Unequal World</i> (Hart,    2001), but the second is a submerged current of the main argument there. The    two circuits are converging in the digital revolution of our day: money is becoming    information and information money. In both cases, the signs exchanged are now    increasingly virtual, meaning that they take the form of bits detached from    persons and places passing through the ether at the speed of light. This process    of digitalization lies at the core of our moment in history; but the precedents    for it go back to the origin of writing and probably further than that.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Information    is an intentional signal from the perspective of the sender, perhaps anything    that reduces the uncertainty of a receiver. The transmission of information    through machines has traditionally come in the form of waves, imperceptible    gradations of light and sound. For communications engineers, <i>analogue</i>    and <i>digital</i> computation rest on measuring and counting, respectively:    on the one hand, continuous changes in physical variables like age, height,    warmth or speed; on the other, discontinuous leaps between discrete entities,    such as days of the week, dollars and cents, letters of the alphabet, named    individuals. <i>Analogue</i> processes, such as time and distance, can be represented    digitally; but it was something of a breakthrough for early modern science to    measure continuous physical change with precision. Before that the clarity of    phenomena was generally enhanced and comparison facilitated by constructing    bounded entities that could be counted, by digitalization.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Digital    numeration is at its clearest when the only possible signals are binary: on/off,    yes/no, either/or, 0/1. And this reversion to an older system of simple enumeration    lies behind the latest revolution in communications. Digitalization greatly    increases the speed and reliability of information processing and transmission;    it also lies behind the rapid convergence of what were once discrete systems:    television, telephones, computers. The last have been digital from the beginning,    while the other two have almost completed the shift from sound waves to digital    transmission. As a result, any kind of information can be carried by all types    of equipment, which become essentially substitutable. Communications technology    in future will consist in various combinations of screen, computer and transmitter/receiver.    The manufacturing monopolists will fight over whether the resulting hybrids    resemble more a television set, a PC or a telephone. But the process common    to all is digitalization and the present moment of convergence lends our era    its specificity. We should not stress information at the expense of people.    For the relations we make with each other matter more than the content of the    messages that pass between us or the means of their transmission. In order to    place the internet within a broader context of social life, we should step back    to examine its historical antecedents.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Human communication    starts out as speech and the words exchanged are usually between people who    can see as well as hear each other. A lot of non-verbal information accompanies    the words - gestures, tone, emanations of feeling - and this helps us to interpret    what is said and how to respond. This is surely why we say that social interaction    is real. The words are abstract enough; but the exchange is face-to-face, grounding    what passes between us in the exigency of place. Writing made it possible to    detach meaning from the persons and places where it was generated and to communicate    at some distance in time and space, not only in the here and now (Goody, 1977,    1987). Even then, the signs were often highly particular, too many for all but    a select few to understand and variable from one scribe to the next. The alphabet    took the process of simplifying the signs a step further, one sound for one    unambiguous letter, thereby making it possible for writing to be adopted more    widely and reliably. It was, if you will, a cheapening of the cost of transmitting    information.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The Phoenician    city states, maritime traders of the Lebanese coast, were the main pioneers    of alphabetic writing at the beginning of the first millennium BC; and it came    into Europe through the Greeks. I like to speculate how books were received    at first. For example on Homer: "All youngsters want to do today is read at    home. You can't get them to go out or anything. They have no idea what it was    like hearing the old boy in a torch-lit barn on a Saturday night, with his voice    echoing in the rafters. It brought tears to your eyes. Well, some of it was    the smoke too." Many more people have had access to the bard over the last 3,000    years than could ever have been in the same room as him during his lifetime,    even if the experience of reading is less sensational than a live performance.    Virtual communication takes place more in the mind than in actual fact. The    only way people could escape from the restrictions of the here and now was through    exercising their imagination, usually under the stimulus of story-telling. Alphabetic    writing, ultimately the book, vastly increased the scope of the collective imagination.    It also made possible more practical exchanges at distance.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">At more    or less the same time as the alphabet (around 700 BC), coinage was invented    in Lydia, now a part of Turkey (Keynes, 1930). Alphabetic writing and this new    form of money were profoundly subversive of old ways. Until then, wealth and    power were concrete and visible, being attached to the people who had them.    They took the form of cattle, vineyards, buildings, armed men and beautiful    women. Now riches could be concealed as gold coins, allowing for a double detachment    from persons - impersonal exchange at distance and unaccountable economic power    (because hidden and private). From the beginning writing found a ready application    in palace bureaucracy. The king could send messages while remaining himself    invisible. It is one thing to be beaten up by royal thugs; but imagine the terror    of receiving a written message saying "please commit suicide before tomorrow".    We feel something of this dread whenever we receive a tax demand from the unseen    hand of a remote authority.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Plato captures    this in a story he tells in <i>The Republic</i>. Gyges was one of the Lydian    king's servants. The king had a ring which made him invisible. He took Gyges    with him one night to spy on his wife getting ready for bed. Gyges and the wife    eventually ganged up to kill the king. Gyges got the ring, the wife and the    kingdom, making him a precursor of legendary rich rulers like Midas. Marc Shell    (1978) argues that this myth expresses the contradictions widely felt at the    time between visible, personal society and invisible, impersonal society. The    Greeks were very concerned about the security of contracts between strangers.    They insisted that each contract (for which they devised the word <i>symbolon</i>)    should be marked by an object like a ring split in the presence of both parties    and a witness. They didn't quite believe in pieces of paper.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">As long    as books were handwritten, their circulation was restricted to a small literate    elite capable of copying and reading them. In my old university, Cambridge,    until the 16<sup>th</sup> century, teachers carried their own scrolls around    in the deep pockets of their gowns and read them out for payment to students    who thereby ended up with their own copies. Copying was not in itself a major    obstacle to the diffusion of texts. The ability to interpret the texts was scarce    and costly. Printing made it possible for many more people to get hold of written    material; and to an extent it eliminated some of the ambiguities of handwriting.    It took a line of business away from the hacks with gowns and shifted the emphasis    in learning to the act of interpretation and hence to understanding. When my    students complained of a "lack of structure" in my lectures, meaning that they    wanted to be told the half dozen points that, when memorized by rote, would    ensure a decent pass in the examinations, I used to ask them to consider the    success of Cambridge University Press over the last 450 years (McKitterick,    1992). This was built on putting books directly into the hands of students,    so that they could make up their own minds what they meant, with the help of    learned and hopefully inspiring teachers. Instead, today's students wanted me    to revert to the role of a reader of scrolls before the print revolution, passing    signs from one person to the next without touching the minds of either.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">My grandmother    was born before the car, the radio, film, air travel and all the other transport    and communications technologies that came to dominate 20<sup>th</sup> century    society. I used to marvel at the way she adapted to all of them. Now I am beginning    to understand what she had to put up with; for, having lived through every year    since the second world war, I realize how profoundly my world has changed in    these respects. I grew up without television in the home and with very limited    opportunities for travel; so I relied on books to get away from it all. It feels    as if my intensive training in the manipulation of words and numbers (Latin,    Greek and maths) now belongs to another age. I have managed to gain a toehold    on the digital revolution, largely through the tolerant assistance of bright    young people who have grown up with it. For them, the phase of national television    that I missed is already a bygone era. We all enter this extraordinary time    with a bundle of advantages and drawbacks. I take pride in a facility for writing    coherent e-mail messages at a pace somewhere between a letter and a phone-call.    Yet I also know that communicating through keyboards will soon be replaced by    audio-visual methods, thereby removing one more link between the book and the    screen. My academic colleagues are still fighting the war against television,    refusing to allow one into a living room designed to show off their books. It's    all relative.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">One consequence    of this revolution is a tendency for academics to consider books and computers    to be opposed rather than complementary technologies. Yet print media are expanding    almost as fast as their new electronic counterparts. Face-to-face exchanges,    instead of being displaced by telecommunications, take on an added value when    one spends the working day in front of a computer screen. Simple pursuits like    reading and conversation, which used to be taken for granted when they monopolized    our means of communication, can be approached in a more analytical and creative    frame of mind now that there are so many other ways of acquiring and transmitting    ideas. I do most of my writing in a Paris apartment, the long-distance writer's    traditional retreat into privacy; nothing new there. But I also keep up dialogues    by e-mail with friends living all over the world. And no writer was able to    do that before the 1990s. I now have a virtual office to accommodate a life    of movement; my laptop, but I was forced to recognize the value of my own memory    when it was stolen. Each of us experiences the digital revolution in our own    way; yet there are changes taking place that affect us all.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Computers    have been with us for over 50 years, television for a bit longer and telephones    for twice that long. In the1990s these technologies converged with the emergence    of a worldwide network of communications, the internet. The internet is the    most inclusive term for all the electronic networks in the world. It is the    network of networks. These are decentralized to a large extent, but they constitute    a conceptual unity in much the same way as "the world market" does. Indeed the    latter's transactions increasingly take place on the internet. The World Wide    Web is a disembodied machine, a type of software, that emerged in 1994 for use    on the internet. It allows people to display messages in a non-interactive way    through a multi-media format, employing words, pictures, sound, animation and    video. The big innovation at the time was the move from words and numbers to    visual images. All messages are transmitted between computers and television    screens (hardware) by means of telephone and radio signals. The infrastructure    for these transmissions in turn constitutes a rapidly evolving network of satellites,    cable grids and other means.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The internet    was for several decades restricted in use to a strategic complex of military,    academic and business interests, based in the United States and Europe. For    some time, the most intensive use of the internet was between physicists located    near the two main nuclear accelerators in Illinois and Geneva. These scientists    lent to the medium its definitive style and content in the early decades: highly    technical, closed and clubby. By the time that the internet went public in 1993,    there were only three million users in the world. In the next five years the    number of users increased to 100 mn. This figure is now estimated to be 600    mn or 1 in 10 people alive. No previous technology has diffused so fast through    the world's population. The internet is an American invention; certainly they    behave as if they own it. The Europeans are now trying to get a world regulatory    authority for the internet set up in Geneva. But the Americans still constitute    well over half of users and most of the practical instruments for intervening    in the network are located there. Several hundred satellites now make broadband    communications available to users worldwide. This side of the digital revolution    favours large corporations, even as it distributes the medium to an ever-widening    network of decentralized users. At present, the fastest-growing use of the internet    is for electronic commerce, something almost unknown before the 1990s. At the    same time, companies and private individuals are forming intranets, exclusive    circuits of information exchange offering higher security than the public medium.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">If ever    there was a challenge to empiricism, the habit of extrapolating from previous    experience, it is posed by trying to guess what the social impact of all this    is likely to be. Compare, for example, the adoption of iron in the lands bordering    the Eastern Mediterranean 3,000 years ago. Iron is the commonest metal ore on    earth and it is extremely robust and malleable. When the technique of smelting    it was first discovered, small quantities of iron were used principally for    prestigious ornaments worn by the ruling classes. Then it found a military use    as weapons which allowed some groups to gain a temporary advantage over their    neighbours. It took several hundred years in most cases for iron to find its    most significant application, as tools used in the production of food and manufacture    by the common people. If you had happened to be living in Assyria, say, at the    beginning of iron production, you would have guessed that its destiny was to    be a symbolic and practical means of maintaining the dominance of a military    caste. Much the same inference could have been drawn in relation to the internet    at any time during the Cold War.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">So what    is the digital revolution? It consists of rapid changes in the size, cost and    especially speed of machines capable of processing information (Naughton, 1999;    US Department of Commerce, 1998). This is now measured as millions of instructions    per second or MIPS. The world's first computer, the Electronic Numerical Integrator    and Computer (ENIAC), was built soon after the second world war; it cost millions    of dollars, was 50 metres wide and 3 metres tall, and processed 5,000 instructions    per second. Twenty-five years later, an Intel micro-processor chip, 12 mm square,    cost $200 and processed 60,000 instructions per second (0.06 MIPS). Today Pentium    4 chips have a processing capacity of 10,000 MIPS and this is expected to reach    100,000 MIPS by 2012. In 1980 copper phone wires transmitted information at    the rate of a page of print a second; today, hair-thin optical fibres can transmit    the equivalent of almost a million encyclopaedia volumes per second. Until recently    the modems (linking computers and telephones) most commonly in use took an hour    to download a five-minute video; broadband technology currently available can    perform the same operation in ten seconds.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The following    table puts this contemporary cascade of technical change in context. There are    three main stages of the machine revolution, marked by steam-power, electricity    grids and information-processing, respectively.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ha/v10n21/20618t1.gif"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The steam-engine    was invented in 1712; but it was another sixty years before James Watt's improvements    made it feasible to power factories by this means; and the industrial revolution    proper did not take off until after the Napoleonic Wars (roughly a century after    Newcomen's engine). Electricity was first identified and harnessed in 1831;    over fifty years later, Thomas Edison began generating it for public use. Again,    only in the first decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century was the efficiency    of factories transformed by the wholesale adoption of electric motors; and widespread    domestic use of electrical appliances had to wait until the middle decades of    the twentieth century. It took a hundred years from Faraday's discovery until    80% of Americans were supplied with electricity at home.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">If ENIAC    (its inventor being suitably anonymous for a bureaucratic age) is analogous    to the inventions of Newcomen and Faraday, our time bears comparison with those    moments, half a century later, when the discovery first began to have widespread    social application. It seems to us that the rate of change today is much faster    and more general than those earlier revolutions; and this may be a justifiable    impression. Certainly, the significance of this third phase is much more far-reaching    than before, if only for the internet's role in the formation of world society    as a single interactive network. But vast populations have still barely joined    the steam-power or electricity grid revolutions. In parts of Africa, iron ox-ploughs    in place of hand hoes are bringing agricultural production to a level of technology    that has been normal in the Eurasian land mass for thousands of years. In the    industrial West, human labour was replaced for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century    not by machines, but by horses; and full mechanization of food production had    to wait until the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It looks    then as if it will be another 50 years at least before we can tell how society    is being affected in the regions already open to adoption of the internet. Differences    in the rate and manner of such adoption between the world's regions, classes    and sectors of production will likewise only emerge in the course of the present    century. Steam-power allowed factories to be located away from their principal    source of energy (once water and wood, then coal) and to deploy machines replacing    manual labour. These factories were operated by a new class of industrial entrepreneurs,    individuals like Richard Arkwright who were later parodied in Dickens' novels    (Crabtree, 1923; Dickens, 1854). Electricity helped turn factory production    into a streamlined system of managerial control, powered the office complexes    of the bureaucratic revolution and eventually made domestic life more convenient.    It required a physical network for its distribution and this encouraged governments    to own or licence monopoly operators of grids as the most tangible symbols of    the national economy.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The internet    harnesses light for almost instantaneous communication between machines using    microscopic circuits to process and store information. There are profound implications    for the system of money, for the market economy and its dark twin, capitalism.    Now that the internet is no longer primarily a research tool, its use is increasingly    as a sphere of economic activity, as a link between and within businesses and    between businesses and their customers. It is becoming an electronic marketplace.    The point about electricity is that it travels at the speed of light and the    passage of information itself is essentially costless. This then is a market    with unusual time and space dimensions, where the personal and impersonal aspects    of economic life meet on new terms. It would not be surprising if it took us    a while to adjust our expectations to this situation. In the world opening up    now borderless trade is transacted at the speed of light. Very little of social    significance will be left untouched before long.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The political    economy of the internet</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Money markets    for instruments taking countless notional forms have injected a new instability    into global capitalism. The East Asian stocks bubble burst in 1998, followed    not long afterwards by the dot com crash. Billions of paper assets were wiped    out overnight. Mismanagement by the banks and pension funds has reached colossal    proportions. This apotheosis of capital, its effective detachment from what    real people do, has made many huge fortunes, often for individuals controlling    billions of dollars, 220 of whom own assets equal to the annual income of just    under half the world's people (United Nations Development Program, 1998). The    situation is comparable to that between the first and second world wars. A stock    market boom ended with the Wall Street crash of 1929. The resulting depression    lasted more than a decade and provided the stimulus for building national welfare    states. What political forces can regulate the present money madness in the    interest of people in general? The world organization of money has now reached    a social scale and technical form which make it impossible for states to control    it. This may be good news for democrats and anarchists in the long run; but    in the meantime state capitalism, the attempt to manage markets and accumulation    through national bureaucracy, has been subverted, with rampant inequality and    appalling human distress the inevitable result (Hart, 2001).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">If we are    to grasp the political potential of the current crisis, we should step back    and revisit classical political economy, the discipline that was formed to make    sense of the first machine revolution's economic consequences. Modern knowledge,    as organized by the universities, falls into three broad classes: the natural    sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. The academic division of labour    in our day is concerned with nature, society and humanity, of which the first    two are thought to be governed by objective laws, but knowledge of the last    requires the exercise of subjectivity or critical judgement. Nature and humanity    are represented conventionally through science and art respectively, but the    best way of approaching society is moot, since social science is a recent and    questionable attempt to bring the methods of the natural sciences to bear on    a task that previously had fallen to religion. If science is the commitment    to know the world objectively and art the means of expressing oneself subjectively,    religion was and is a bridge between subject and object, a way of making meaningful    connection between something inside oneself and the world outside. Now that    science has driven religion from the government of modern societies, we must    find new forms of religion capable of reconciling scientific law with personal    experience.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The onset    of the age of machines coincided with various attempts to develop a science    of society, of which British political economy (Ricardo, 1971), French sociology    (Comte, 1975) and German philosophy (Hegel, 1952) all achieved a high level    of definition in the years following the end of the Napoleonic wars. Political    economy was concerned with how the distribution of the value generated by an    expanding market economy might best be deployed in the interest of economic    growth. Smith, Ricardo and their followers identified three types of resources,    each thought to be endowed with the power of increase: the environment (land),    money (capital) and human creativity (labour). These in turn were represented    by their respective owners: landlords, capitalists and workers. Their concern    was with the distribution of specific source of income - rent, profit and wages    - which between them contained the key to the laws of political economy: The    conflict was then between landlords and capitalists; and the policy was to ensure    that the value of market sales was not diverted from the capital fund to high    rents. Only later did the main issue lie between capitalists and workers.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Political    economy held that competitive markets lowered the margins available to distributive    agents and forced capitalists to reduce their production costs through innovations    aimed at improving efficiency. This was achieved through economies of scale,    division of labour and ultimately the introduction of machines to factories    (Marx, 1970). The productivity of labour was thereby raised, allowing the resulting    profits to be ploughed back into an expanded level of activity. Society's manpower    was thereby freed up for more elaborate forms of commercial production. The    only threat to this upward spiral was if landowners raised their rents to take    advantage of these newly profitable industries, diverting value into wasteful    consumption. Worse, whereas the capital fund was inherently limitless, land    was definitely in limited supply. Economic expansion meant population growth,    thereby driving up food prices and squeezing the capital fund on the other side    through wages. The solution was to expose Britain's landowners to competition    with cheap overseas suppliers; and this made free trade the great political    issue of the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The basic    division between classes possessing the environment, money and human creativity    persists today. Indeed, writers as diverse as Locke (1960) and Marx (1970) had    visions of history in which a state of nature or society based on the land gives    way to an age of money (our own) whose contradictions should lead to a just    society based on fair reward for human creativity. So how are these broad classes    of interest manifested in the struggle for the value generated by electronic    commerce? If the owners of money and labour were first allied against the landlords    (industrial capitalism) and then landlords and capitalists united to control    the workers (state capitalism), how are the classes aligned in the present phase    of virtual capitalism?</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The landlord    class has by no means rolled over and died; but the internet offers a means    of escape from land shortage, indeed from spatial constraints of all kinds.    The territorial controls once exercised by the landed aristocracy has largely    now passed to national governments. Territorial states are able to extract taxes    and rents from all money transactions taking place inside or across the boundaries    of their jurisdiction. This has been greatly facilitated by the advances in    bureaucracy made over the last 150 years; but it becomes more difficult when    the source of value shifts from car factories and downtown shopping centres    to commodity exchange conducted at the speed of light across borders. The system    of involuntary transfers (taxation and rents on physical assets) could once    be justified in terms of economic security for all. But that principle has been    under attack by the neo-liberal consensus for over two decades now.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The capitalists    have come a long way too. Having formed an alliance with the traditional rulers    from the 1860s onwards, they absorbed and ultimately defeated the challenge    posed by the workers. The recent revival of free market liberalism provides    triumphal evidence of that victory. But the relationship of capital to the state    has become increasingly moot. Money has always had an international dimension    and the corporations that dominate world capitalism today are less obviously    tied to their nations of origin than before. There are now some three dozen    firms with an annual turnover of $30-50 bn, larger than the GDP of all but eight    countries. Moreover, half of the world's 500 largest firms are American and    a third European So the world economy is controlled today by a few firms of    western origin but with dubious national loyalties. Capital and the nation-state    have always had a relationship of conflict and co-operation. The wave of anti-trust    legislation that accompanied the rise of monopolists like John D. Rockefeller    in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century is matched today by the feebler efforts    of governments to contain the economic power of Microsoft and a few companies    like it. The idea of profit as a form of rent (income from property) has been    confirmed, even if the burden has shifted from workers to consumers. The state    competes for a share of the value of commodities in the form of taxes. But both    rent and tax depend on a system of legal coercion, on a realistic threat of    punishment, to make people pay up. This remains a shared concern of governments    and corporations alike.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">So where    does that leave the rest of us? If Marx and Engels (1968) could identify the    general interest with a growing body of factory workers tied to machines owned    by capitalists, the majority of us now enter the economic process primarily    as consumers. Economic agency is largely a matter of spending money. Despite    the collapse of traditional industries in recent decades, there are still those    who argue that workers associations, unions, remain the best hope for organized    resistance to big business. State capitalism once made people believe in society    as a place with one fixed point. But now the internet points to a more plural    version of society composed of mobile networks. The mass of its ordinary users    have a common interest, as individuals and pressure groups, in avoiding unreasonable    regulation and retaining the economic benefits of their equal exchanges. So    we may provisionally accord to the "wired" a class identity in opposition to    governments and corporations.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ha/v10n21/20618t2.gif"></p>     <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The main    players in the political economy of the internet are thus governments, corporations    and the rest of us, the people (the small minority who are wired). The landed    interest, following a class alliance between landlords and capitalists forged    in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, now takes the principal form of territorial    power, the coercive capacity of states to extract taxes and rents on threat    of punishment or by right of eminent domain. Capitalist profit is now concentrated    in a handful of huge transnational corporations whose interest is to keep up    the price of commodities and to guarantee income from property (rent) in the    face of resistance to payment. On an analogy with the workers who tended the    factory machines (themselves initially a very small minority), we could start    by looking at the wired, the ordinary people who exchange services as equals    on the internet, as representatives of the general human interest. Governments    and corporations need each other, for sure, but their interests are far from    coincident. Both may be vulnerable to self-conscious use of internet resources    by democratic movements. The main threat to us all is the jealous concentration    of state and corporate power to block our collective potential to build a just    society with shared responsibility for life on this planet. We could do worse    then than return to Ricardo's focus on how wealth is distributed in human society    and, in particular, on the contradiction between coercive demands for tax and    rent and the formation of a world market where people freely exchange services    as equals, using money instruments of their own devising (Greco, 2001).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This rather    abstract formulation can be seen at work concretely in current conflicts over    intellectual property rights. The fight is on to save the commons of human culture,    society and environment from the encroachments of corporate private property.    This is no longer mainly a question of conserving the earth's natural resources,    although it is definitely that too, nor of the deterioration of public services    left to the mercies of privatized agencies. The internet has raised the significance    of intangible commodities. Increasingly we buy and sell ideas; and their reproduction    is made infinitely easier by digital technologies. Accordingly, the large corporations    have launched a campaign to assert their exclusive ownership of what until recently    might reasonably have been considered shared culture to which all had free and    equal access. Across the board, separate battles are being fought, without any    real sense of the common cause that they embody. The "napsterization" of popular    music, harbinger of peer-to-peer exchange between individual computers, is one    such battle pitting the feudal barons of the music business against our common    right to transmit songs as we wish. The world of the moving image, of film,    television and video, is likewise a site of struggle sharpened by fast-breaking    technologies affecting their distribution and use. In numerous subtle and not-so-subtle    ways, our ability to draw freely on a common heritage of language, literature    and law is being undermined by the aggressive assertion of copyright. People    who never knew they shared a common infrastructure of culture are now being    forced to acknowledge it by aggressive policies of corporate privatization.    And these policies are being promoted at the international level by the same    American government whose armed forces now seem free to run amok in the world.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In the case    of the internet, what began as a free communications network for a scientific    minority is now the contested domain of giant corporations and governments.    The open source software movement, setting Linux and an army of hackers against    Microsoft's monopoly, has opened up fissures within corporate capitalism itself.    The shift to manufacturing food varieties has introduced a similar struggle    to agriculture, amplified by a revival of 'organic' farming in the context    of growing public concern about genetic modification. The pharmaceutical companies    try to ward off the threat posed to their lucrative monopolies by cheap generics    aimed at the Third World populations who need them most. The buzzword is "intellectual    property rights", slogan of a corporate capitalism determined to impose antiquated    "command and control" methods on world markets whose constitutive governments    have been cowed into passivity. The largest demonstrations against the neo-liberal    world order, from Seattle to Genoa, have been mobilized to a significant degree    by the need to oppose this particular version of global private property. The    events of September 11<sup>th</sup> have temporarily diminished this movement,    especially in North America, just as they have added to the powers of coercion    at the disposal of governments everywhere. In this sense, the global movement    for greater democracy and less inequality has suffered a reverse.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">It is a    widely shared and justified belief that the age of money, whose culmination    we are witnessing today, is not in the interest of most human beings, that the    American government and giant corporations are indifferent to that common interest    of humanity. The rest of the world needs Americans to join them in the struggle    for decent human standards in social life. They bring tremendous resources of    technology, education and economic power to that struggle, but above all they    bring their country's liberal political traditions. It would be a pity if the    effect of September 11<sup>th</sup> were to obscure that possibility of global    democratic solidarity, leaving the world stage to Texas oilmen and Muslim fanatics,    with their mutual conspiracy to divide and rule.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The real    and the virtual</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The digital    revolution is driven by a desire to replicate at distance or by means of computers    experiences that we normally associate with face-to-face human encounters. All    communication, whether the exchange of words or money, has a virtual aspect    in that symbols and their media of circulation stand for what people really    do for each other. It usually involves the exercise of imagination, an ability    to construct meanings across the gap between symbol and reality. The power of    the book depended for so long on sustaining that leap of faith in the possibility    of human communication. In that sense, capitalism was always virtual. Indeed    Marx's intellectual effort was devoted to revealing how the power of money was    mystified through its appearance as things (coins, products, machinery) rather    than as relations between living men (Marx, 1970, p. 71-83). Both Marx and Weber    (1981) were at pains to show how capitalists sought to detach their money-making    activities, as far as possible, from real conditions obstructing their purposes.    Money-lending, the practice of charging interest on loans without any intervening    act of production or exchange, is one of the oldest forms of capitalism. So    the idea of the money circuit becoming separated from reality is hardly new.    Yet there are changes taking place which deserve a distinctive label and, for    the time being, "virtual capitalism" will have to do.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The point    of virtualism (Carrier; Miller, 1998) is abstraction and this in turn is a function    of the shift to ever more inclusive levels of exchange, to the world market    as principal point of reference for economic activity, rather than the nation-state.    But reliance on more abstract forms of communication carries with it the potential    for real persons to be involved with each other at a distance in very concrete    ways. The idea of "virtual reality" expresses this double movement: on the one    hand machines whose complexity their users cannot possibly understand, on the    other live experiences "as good as" real. It is the same with money. Capitalism    has become virtual in two main senses: the shift from material production (agriculture    and manufacturing) to information services; and the corresponding detachment    of the circulation of money from production and trade. This in turn is an aspect    of the latest stage of the machine revolution at the millennium (Hart, 2001).    What would constitute an anthropology of all this?</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Daniel Miller    and Don Slater (2001) have good news for traditional ethnographers: the internet    does not make any difference. In <i>The Internet: an ethnographic approach</i>,    their fieldwork-based monograph on Trinidad, they rightly argue that cyberspace    should not be treated as a separate sphere of social activity; but, instead    of exploring the dialectic of virtual and real experience, they reduce the former    to the latter, claiming that what matters is the location of internet users    in everyday life, where they can be studied by ethnographers, of course. This    leads them to ignore business-to-business exchange (b2b) altogether and to approach    e-commerce solely through business-customer interaction on websites. In order    to generalize from a small sample of households, they assert the unity of "Trinidadians"    as a national group in defiance of fifty years debate about the racial and class    composition of Creole society. So the old Malinowskian recipe appears to be    alive and well in the insular Caribbean. But there has to be more to it than    that.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">If we would    make a better world, rather than just contemplate it, one prerequisite is to    learn to think creatively in terms that both reflect reality and reach out for    imagined possibilities. This in turn depends on capturing what is essential    about the world we live in, its movement and direction, not just its stable    forms. The idea of <i>virtual reality</i> goes to the heart of the matter. It    expresses the form of movement that interests me - <i>extension from the actual    to the possible.</i> "Virtual" means existing in the mind, but not in fact.    When combined with "reality", it means a product of the imagination that is    almost but not quite real. In technical terms, "virtual reality" is a computer    simulation that enables the effects of operations to be shown in real time.    The word "real" connotes something genuine, authentic, serious. In philosophy    it means existing objectively in the world; in economics it is actual purchasing    power; in law it is fixed, landed property; in optics it is an image formed    by the convergence of light rays in space; and in mathematics, real numbers    are, of course, not imaginary ones. "Reality" is present, in terms of both time    and space ("seeing is believing"); and its opposite is imagined connection at    distance, something as old as story-telling and books, but now given a new impetus    by the internet. Already the experience of near synchrony at distance, the compression    of time and space, is altering our conceptions of social relationships, of place    and movement.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">What interests    me is less the digital divide between people with and without access to the    internet, the "wired" elite versus the "unwired" masses, but how what we do    offline influences what we do on it and <i>vice versa.</i> In this, I have taken    some inspiration from Martin Heidegger's <i>The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics:    World, Finitude, Solitude</i> (2001). He says there that "world" is an abstract    metaphysical category for each of us (all that relates to or affects the life    of a person) and its dialectical counterpart is "solitude", the idea of the    isolated individual. Every human subject makes a world of his or her own whose    centre is the self.. The world opens up only to the extent that we recognize    ourselves as finite, as individual, and this should lead us to "finitude", the    concrete specifics of time and place in which we necessarily live. So "world"    is relative both to an abstract version of subjectivity and, more important,    to our particularity in the world (seen as position and movement in time and    space).</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The internet    is often represented as a self-sufficient universe with its own distinctive    characteristics, as when Castells (1996) writes of the rise of a new ideal type,    "network society". The idea that each of us lives alone (solitude) in a world    largely of our own making seems to be more real when we go online. But both    terms are imagined as well as being reciprocal; they are equally abstract and    untenable as an object of inquiry. We approach them from a relative location    in society where we actually live, as Miller and Slater say. Therefore it cannot    be satisfactory to study the social forms of the internet independently of what    people bring to it from elsewhere in their lives. This social life of people    off-line is an invisible presence when they are on it. It would be wrong, however,    to deny any autonomy at all to "virtual reality". Would we dream of reducing    literature to the circumstances of readers? And this too is Heidegger's point.    "World" and "solitude" may be artificial abstractions, but they do affect how    we behave in "finitude". The dialectical triad forms an interactive set:</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/ha/v10n21/20618d1.gif"></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>A Kantian    anthropology for the internet age</b></font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">What then    might be an anthropology for the internet age? I would start with Immanuel Kant's    <i>Perpetual Peace: a Philosophical Sketch</i> (1795). He held that Cosmopolitan    Right, the basic right of all world citizens, should rest on conditions of universal    hospitality, that is, the right of a stranger not to be treated with hostility    when he arrives on someone else's territory. In other words, we should be free    to go wherever we like in the world, since it belongs to all of us equally.    The contrast with our routine experience of international travel today could    not be more marked. He says, "The peoples of the earth have entered in varying    degree into a universal community, and it has developed to the point where a    violation of rights in <i>one</i> part of the world is felt <i>everywhere</i>.    The idea of a cosmopolitan right is not fantastic and overstrained; it is a    necessary complement to the unwritten code of political and international right,    transforming it into a universal right of humanity." This confident sense of    an emergent world order, written over 200 years ago by the man who defined "anthropology"    for modern purposes (Kant, 1977), can now be seen to be a product of the high    point of the liberal revolution, before it was overwhelmed by its twin offspring,    industrial capitalism and the nation state (Hart, 2003). We now live in a less    confident world, but it can still generate moments that touch our universal    humanity, like the first man to orbit the earth in space or a Chinese man confronting    a tank on global television.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Kant believed    that human co-operation in society required us to rely on personal judgement    moderated by common sense, in the double meaning of shared intelligence and    taste. This common sense, also the title of his contemporary Tom Paine's (1995)    revolutionary pamphlet that launched the American war of independence, was generated    in everyday life, in shared social experience (good food, good talk, good company).    Earlier he wrote an essay, "Idea for a universal history with a cosmopolitan    purpose" (Kant, 1991), which included these propositions:</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">In man (as    the only rational creature on earth) those natural faculties which aim at the    use of reason shall be fully developed in the species, not in the individual.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The means    that nature employs to accomplish the development of all faculties is the antagonism    of men in society, since this antagonism becomes, in the end, the cause of a    lawful order of this society.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The latest    problem for mankind, the solution of which nature forces us to seek, is the    achievement of a civil society which is capable of administering law universally.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">This problem    is both the most difficult and the last to be solved by mankind.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">A philosophical    attempt to write a universal world history according to a plan of nature which    aims at perfect civic association of mankind must be considered to be possible    and even as capable of furthering nature's purpose.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The world    is much more socially integrated today than two centuries ago and its economy    is palpably unjust. We have barely survived three world wars (two hot, one cold)    and brutality provokes fear everywhere. Moreover, the natural (we would say    "ecological") consequences of human actions are likely to be severely disruptive,    if left unchecked. Histories of the universe we inhabit do seem to be indispensable    to the construction of institutions capable of administering justice worldwide.    When Roy Rappaport (1999, p. 461) wrote recently that "Humanity...is that    part of the world through which the world as a whole can think about itself",    he was repeating the central idea of Kant's prescient essay. The task of building    a global civil society for the 21<sup>st</sup> century is urgent and anthropological    visions must play their part in that.</font></p>     ]]></body>
<body><![CDATA[<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">Copernicus    solved the problem of the movement of the heavenly bodies by having the spectator    revolve while they were at rest, instead of them revolve around the spectator.    Kant extended this achievement for physics into metaphysics (Cassirer, 1981,    p. 148-149). In his preface to <i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i>, he writes,    "Hitherto it has been assumed that all our knowledge must conform to objects...    (but what) if we suppose that objects must conform to our knowledge?". In order    to understand the world, we must begin not with the empirical existence of objects,    but with the reasoning embedded in our experience itself and in all the judgments    we have made. Which is to say that the world is inside each of us as much as    it is out there. This is why one definition of "world" is "all that relates    to or affects the life of a person". Our task is to bring the two poles together    as subjective individuals who share the object world in common with the rest    of humanity.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">The 19th    and 20th centuries, in identifying society with the state, constitute a counter-revolution    against Kant's Copernican revolution. This was launched by Hegel (1952), whose    <i>Philosophy of Right</i> contains the programmes of all three founding fathers    of modern social theory (Marx, Weber, Durkheim) rolled into one. This counter-revolution    was only truly consummated after the first world war. The result was a separation    of the personal from the impersonal, the subject from the object, humanism from    science. It was enshrined in the academic division of labour and it is why most    people have never heard of Kant's seminal contribution to anthropology. This    is the split that the decline of state capitalism in the face of the digital    revolution might allow us to reverse. In my book (Hart, 2001), I argued that    the cheapening of the cost of information transfers as a result of the digital    revolution makes it possible for much more information about individuals to    enter into commercial transactions at distance that were until recently largely    impersonal. This repersonalization of the economy has its counterpart in many    aspects of contemporary social life, not just in the forms of money and exchange.    It involves a new idea of the person, one that is based on digital abstractions    as much as on the emergence of more concrete forms of individuality. The customized    interactions that most academics now have with amazon.com and similar suppliers    of books reflect this trend, at the same time personal and remote.</font></p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">I do not    imagine that I am alone when I respond in this way to our moment of history.    Clearly one consequence of the use of new technologies in teaching is that learning    can now be much more individualized and ecumenical at the same time; and this    juxtaposition of self and the world in itself poses a threat to the traditions    of the academic guild. Here then is one source of a renewed emphasis on subjectivity.    It all adds up to a radical revision of conventional attitudes to subject-object    relations, grounds indeed for us to reconsider the positivist dogmas on which    so many modern university disciplines are based, including social anthropology's    paradigm of scientific ethnography (Grimshaw; Hart, 1993, 1995). It has long    been obvious to me that learning anthropology would be impossible if we were    not, each of us, human beings in the first place. Anthropologists who once could    rely on public ignorance as support for their exotic tales must now cope with    mass mobility and communications. We have to consider seriously what our expertise    can offer that is not delivered more effectively through novels and films, journalism    or tourism. We live in a time when both the rhetoric and the reality of markets    encourage individuals to choose the means of their own Enlightenment. It would    be surprising if trends in the teaching of anthropology did not reflect all    this; perhaps we are on the verge of a new paradigm for the discipline, one    that will reflect the social and technological changes of which the internet    is the most tangible symbol.</font></p>     <p>&nbsp;</p>     <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="3"><b>References</b></font></p>     <!-- ref --><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica-Normal, sans-serif" size="2">CARRIER,    J.; MILLER, D. <i>Virtualism</i>: a new political economy.

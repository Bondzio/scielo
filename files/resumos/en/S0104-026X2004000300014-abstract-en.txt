Gender and religion constitute a still little discussed and admited equation. In the field of feminist studies this relation is still referred to in a very timid way. The initiatives of studing this issue are very scarce specially by specific journals in the gender area. The two more expressive academic feminist journals in Brasil Revista Estudos Feministas and Cadernos Pagu have been an important site to discuss this theme. Another publication to be outlined in this area is Revista Mandr√°gora, a specific journal on feminist studies and religion.

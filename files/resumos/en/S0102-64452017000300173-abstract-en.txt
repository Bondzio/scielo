Abstract The article investigates what we are doing when we practice political theory today, analyzing feminist theories of politics in reference to the development of political sciences in the second half of the twentieth century. It discusses the connections between the empirical and the normative in theories that put into question the detachment between the knowledge produced, the position of who produces knowledge, and predominant values in a given social context. From a heterogeneous set of approaches, the article asserts that political theories are gender theories even when they do not address gender, discussing the frontiers between what is and what is not considered politically relevant in theoretical debate.

Abstract The article is based on an empirical research concerning homicides in Metropolitan Area of Brasília. The first step was the georeferenced localization of homicides in 2010. From this point, after detecting 565 deaths officially registered in the area, the focus was directed to the flux of the criminal justice system in three selected cities: Luziânia, Cidade Ocidental and Águas Lindas de Goiás. This article intends to focus on organizational dynamics and the social representations of the actors of the criminal justice system in the studied area.

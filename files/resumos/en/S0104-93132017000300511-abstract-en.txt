Abstract This article is about Guarani-speaking people, particularly those who live in the state of SÃ£o Paulo in villages close to urban centres and motorways. Seeking to compose a Guarani aetiology of the dispositions and indispositions of bodies, I turn to conceptualisations of what mixes and what is put into circulation among/in persons/people, with their transformational effects and fractal dimensions. More specifically, the article considers indispositions felt as illness, or as a condition of not getting used to, which may be linked to not being subjected. Its aim is to foreground Guarani modulations on pressing themes in Amerindian ethnology, such as alterity, affinity and predation, as well as on wider anthropological debates on mestijaze and its assumptions concerning differing.

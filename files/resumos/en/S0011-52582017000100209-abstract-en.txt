ABSTRACT This article analyzes the impact of updates to practices and discourses on the &#8220;removal&#8221; of favelas in Rio de Janeiro, discussing the format adopted by collective actions organized by residents in the period from 2009 to 2012. With the study seeking to understand how perceptions shared by these actors on the issue interfere with its definition as a public problem, the main line of criticism taken by the residents in such circumstances targets the &#8220;procedure&#8221;, i.e. &#8220;the way in which&#8221; removal is carried out by the public authorities. This complaint is made across two levels, with the first directed at how the interventions affect the daily lives and numerous, long-established sociability networks in the area, and the second concerning the central question of how these processes are seen by those impacted as a kind of &#8220;moral disqualification&#8221;.

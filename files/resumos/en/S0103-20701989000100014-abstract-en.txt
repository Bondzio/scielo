An excursion through the Great Sert&#227;o&#8217;s paths constitutes a labrynthine narrative through which Riobaldo Tatarana&#8217;s life passes. From being a teacher to becoming Urut&#250;-Branco, his adventures as a jagun&#231;o, his misadventures with women, his dialogues with God and the Devil, are all multifaceted expressions of the same experience. Memory becomes the recovery of the several meanings of that experience and the understanding of them all - always mediated by the transitory world of the jagun&#231;o and by women - he loved, eternal bearers of the secrets of his paths. Nhorinh&#225;, Otac&#237;lia, and, finally, Diadorim are all diverse possibilities - the various colors of topaz.

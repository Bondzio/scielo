Abstract Some themes of an economic nature have also become prominent in areas such as the social sciences, particularly political science, and economic sociology. The objective of this study is to emphasize the role of economic sociology in articulating some analytical sources for themes recurrently present in government agendas, using the phenomenon of fiscal war as the core of our study. Therefore, we aim in this work to discuss fiscal war not as an autonomous phenomenon, belonging to the economic sphere, but as a product of sociological and political interactions on the part of social actors, such as state governors. We use a secondary source bibliography, located in disciplines such as economics, economic sociology, and political science.

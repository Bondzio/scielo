Abstract The book reviewed presents an essential and very didactic panorama of studies on clientelism, including on contemporary societies. It represents a fundamental contribution to the social sciences by broadening the perspective of denunciation, emphasizing that clientelism is a concept that is difficult to dissociate from a moral intention, and, especially, inquiring to what extent the intellectual diagnoses of that pathology of politics are mobilized as criticism, delegitimization or disqualification of the practices of opponents involved in the political struggle.

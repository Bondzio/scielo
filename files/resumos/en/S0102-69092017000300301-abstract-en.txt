In the last nine months, the simultaneous implementation of neoliberal politics by the &#8220;Cambiemos&#8221; government in key areas of social life resulted in a drastic transference of the investments to concentrated sectors. This constitutes a vertiginous experience of precarization of life and loss of rights for the poorest sectors, but at the same time of formidable demonstrations of resistance and social mobilization. Based on an ethnographic study in co-labor, this presentation explores the developments and the rearrangements of political groups and popular movements, as well as the strategies, resources, ways of collective action and reconfigurations of the daily life in this context, including our insertion in this process as anthropologists.

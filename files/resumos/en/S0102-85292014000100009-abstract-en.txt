This article discusses the role of the epistemic communities in the production and diffusion of knowledge, in view of the understanding of cooperation among actors in the International System. The Internationally Shared Aquifer Resources Management, ISARM, was taken as an example of epistemic community considering the role that it has played in the diffusion of knowledge that assists the States to better manage existing groundwater resources in their territory or transboundary regions. To accomplish this goal, the methodology used was basically the document analysis. The main sources consulted were the documents and records of meetings and conferences available by ISARM - Americas on its website. The article is organized as follows: a section for a brief theoretical discussion about the concept of epistemic community and its role in the production of conditions for cooperation among states; then an explanation is made about the ISARM and its acting in Americas in the production of scientific knowledge about the aquifer, the existing normative framework in the countries of the region to manage these resources. Still, in this session, a brief presentation of the Strategic Action Plan for Guarani Aquifer is made. At the end, the conclusions of this work are presented.

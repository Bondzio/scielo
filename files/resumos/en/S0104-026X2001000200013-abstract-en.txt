This article is based on a qualitative research in an elementary school at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and discusses the academic evaluation of pupils, searching if teacher's opinions about masculinity and femininity affect her/his judgments. The text concludes that it is time to reflect upon these topics in the educational field, because gender inequalities and hierarchies are powerful interferences on the evaluation processes used in most Brazilian elementary schools.

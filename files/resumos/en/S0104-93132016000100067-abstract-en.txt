Abstract: The objective of this paper is to present the French pragmatic sociology as outlined in Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thévenot's De la justification. First, we make a general introduction of the main focal points of the French sociological field from the eighties. Then, we present De la justification, regarded as a landmark of the pragmatist turn of French sociology. Next, we present two of its key concepts: cité and proof. Finally, through an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the model, we question some of its limits and challenges, such as integrating the pragmatist intuition with issues such as the sociologist's critical engagement, and the analysis of long-term processes, problems, and dispositions.

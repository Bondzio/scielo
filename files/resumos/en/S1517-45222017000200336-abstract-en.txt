Abstract The article investigates Bourdieu&#8217;s answer to a classic problem in the epistemology of the social sciences: how is an objective knowledge of the social world possible if social scientists&#8217; points of view are conditioned by their belonging to this world? The text presents his thesis that the sociology of sociology, by revealing the social conditionings of social thought, enables a margin of freedom from these conditionings. Far from sliding into multiperspectivistic relativism, therefore, Bourdieu&#8217;s reflexive sociology is geared towards the conquest of objectivity. The paper also shows that his notion of sociological reflexivity is articulated to a conception of scientific objectivity as a &#8220;sublimated&#8221; effect of the rule-bound competition between interested agents that characterizes the field of science. Finally, although sympathetic to Bourdieu&#8217;s proposal, the article is interspersed with critical considerations about the tensions that inhere to it: a) the recognition of the &#8220;positioned&#8221; nature of his sociological interventions versus the intention of capturing the whole space of social-scientific viewpoints; b) the defense of a sociological reflexivity based on the rational dialectic of the scientific field versus the admission that social sciences do not possess enough autonomy to bring this rational dialectic about.

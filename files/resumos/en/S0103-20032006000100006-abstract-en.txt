The main objective of this article was to analyse the hybrid corn program considering competitiveness, techonology level, creation of job opportunities and income in the state of Ceará. The research was conducting in the main hybrid corn producing counties (Iguatú, Milagres e Capistrano). The data were obtained by interviewing corn producing farmers. Technology index for each technology as well as for all the tecnonologies as a group, used by corn farmers, was calculated. The rentability indicators such as gross profit, operational profit and profitability index were determined. The technologies of weed control, seed quality and thinning of crop contributed more in the formation of general technology index of hybrid corn production, where as the technology of after harvesting had the lowest participation in the construction of this index. The average income per hectare of hybrid corn was higher as compared to corn variety in all the three counties considered in this research. The indicators analysed showed that the production of hybrid corn is profitable and studied farmers are competitives.

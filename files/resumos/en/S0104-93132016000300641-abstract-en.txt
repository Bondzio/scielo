Abstract In this article I deal with the proliferation and the specificity of motivations, meanings and circuits subsumed in the experience of movement which takes places in Terceira Margem, a rural community located in the cerrado region in the state of Minas Gerais. The description of the different modes of movement is based on the practices of circulation, such as hospitality, visiting, and helping, and on the causes of the wanderings and the arrivals at the houses of kinspeople and acquaintances. Finally, I discuss the implications of the different expressions of movements on the Margeens in their meetings with strangers and relatives.

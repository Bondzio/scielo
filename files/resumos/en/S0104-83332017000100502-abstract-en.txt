Abstract This article reconstructs the connections between urban life and homosexual modes of socialization in Buenos Aires between 1950 &#8211; 1983. With the analysis of written sources, interviews, literary works and the mapping, we propose a description of this subculture. Among the objectives it highlighted: the relationship of homosexual subculture with other social groups such as workers or marginal people, modes of circulation and appropriation of space, the tactics of resistance to violence and emotional public networks launched. Processes that are contextualized in the structural changes experienced by the city to the twentieth century. The intention that prevails in this text is to build an endogenous narrative of the social group dinamic to scape to the descriptions that cataloged this world as &#8220;secret&#8221; or &#8220;invisible&#8221;. So also attempting to dissuade the concept of homosexual identity as appropriation of speeches made in other fields such as medical or state.

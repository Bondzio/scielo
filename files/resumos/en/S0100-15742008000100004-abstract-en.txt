This article presents the results of a research whose main goal was to know how imprisoned adolescents express their sexuality. The data were collected in three Brazilian northeast states that had adopted the public policy of offering 'intimate' visits to youngsters in conflict with the law. The results present the adolescents' profile, their sexual life and health care before the imprisonment, their sexual life inside the institution and, finally, the 'intimate' visits from the youngsters' point of view. This public policy was evaluated considering both the collected data and the adolescents' rights to autonomy, participation, equality, non-discrimination, corporal integrity and health. As conclusion, recommendations were made in order to make the public policy of 'intimate' visits more adequate to attend the sexual rights of imprisoned adolescents.

In this work I analyze some processes of production and conveyance of maternity representations, having the Programa Nacional Bolsa-Escola as its reference. My study is located in the field of cultural theory, mainly in the Cultural Studies and Feminist Studies perspectives, in approaches that have proposed a critical approximation to the post-structuralist analysis. In order to perform this research, I selected a set of documents related to the Program, which were produced and published from 1999 to 2003. I have explored the texts of the Program on the basis of concepts such as discourse, representation, identity, gender and power, aiming at analyzing the different ways by which maternity has been represented and signified there.

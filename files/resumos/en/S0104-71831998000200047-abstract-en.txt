Abstract Studying the process of transmission of &#8220;practical knowledge&#8221; among urban workers, it is discussed the place and meaning of narrated &#8220;cases&#8221; that are regarded as exemplar. Such &#8220;cases&#8221;, are taken as representative of events and as memory of life experiences. The record of these cases, their circulation and transmission builds up a pedagogy that works as a way of constructing identities. In this paper, are analyzed cases of &#8220;miraculous healing&#8221;, classified in two main categories: as cases of &#8220;desengano&#8221; [hopeless cases] and cases of spiritual healing. Through this empirical material, I discuss the interrelation and the confrontation between different knowledge regarding the body and the disease, within its &#8220;native&#8221; connotation of &#8220;practical and theoretical knowledge&#8221;. The analysis of these cases also allows us to think about the place of orality in societies where the literacy is a dominant mode of knowledge, at the same time that contributes to a discussion about the construction of the familiar and local memory.

Abstract The article addresses the reform of Brazil&#8217;s high school carried out in 2017 by the Ministry of Education of the Temer administration. From this perspective, it provides a critical discussion of the political and economic interests involved, the ongoing ideological disputes, the official objectives presented (as well as the unexpressed ones) and the structure of this stage of Elementary Education, with special attention given to curricular flexibilization and the notion of quality education on which it is based. The article also considers the outcomes of the reform for teachers, as well as the relations between this reform and the others promoted by the Temer administration.

This article is a critique of the theories that sustain that Marx affirms that the labor force is paid for its value. Here we try to show that a violation of the value of the labor force is a problem inscribed in Marxist theory and present in O Capital. On the other hand, it argues about the importance of the notion of dependent capitalism and its meaning to understand its particularities that separate it from the traits and objectives of capitalism developed.

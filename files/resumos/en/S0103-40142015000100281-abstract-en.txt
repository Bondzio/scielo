This paper aims to not only review the criticism of the proposals of the 1990 Orthographic Agreement, but also to provide accessible explanation for the common reader of the philosophy that guided the drafting of the text adopted by the nations where Portuguese is the official language. It also aims to remind critics that the Agreement addressed only topics showed divergence between the 1945 system in effect in Portugal and in African countries, and the 1943 system in effect in Brazil. Forms that showed no discrepancy were not on the discussion table. The treaty was an Agreement, not a Reform.

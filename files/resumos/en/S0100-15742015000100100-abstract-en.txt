This article presents the results of the national and international literature review on supervised internship and the role of the cooperating-teacher who receives and monitors the teaching training of interns in the school. The teacher, initially trained to provide basic education, receives interns in his/her class without necessarily relying on guidance on how to perform this formative function. The studies investigated revealed the learning from the performance of this function follows those of vocational schools, mainly through transmission of exemplary practices. These training practices clash with certain proposals for teacher education that are being established in the current educational context, marked by speeches on the professionalization of teaching.

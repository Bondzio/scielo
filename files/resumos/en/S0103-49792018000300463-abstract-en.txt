The article analyzes the main contributions of the political economy of dependence from the debates that the work of Ruy Mauro Marini aroused. It proposes the theoretical reformulation of the concepts of superexploitation of labor and of subimperialism with the aim of updating and enriching the Marxist theory of dependency to analyze the trends of contemporary capitalism and the historical forms it has assumed in Latin America. It is divided into three parts, the first where Marini&#8217;s thinking and his contributions to political economy are presented, the second where the main criticisms of his approach are presented, and the third one where we sustain his approach from some reformulations that are considered necessary to develop it.

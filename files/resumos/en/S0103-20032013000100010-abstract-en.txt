The quality is a complex issue that manifests significantly in Vale dos Vinhedos, the main producing area of fine wines in Brazil. Therefore, the study discusses the social construction of the quality of fine wines in Vale dos Vinhedos, microregion that was defined to begin a process of recognition of Geographical Indication. Increasingly, markets have been perceived as social constructions, in which the actors have the ability to create differentiated products. The objective of this research is to characterize and analyze Vale dos Vinhedos as an institutional and organizational environment that is socially constructed, based on elements of the coordination of agents. A study was conducted with exploratory qualitative approach through interviews with selected agents. The result showed that social construction promotes quality evolution and development, when actors aimed to reveal and assert an identity.

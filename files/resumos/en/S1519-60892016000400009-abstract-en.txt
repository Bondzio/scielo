Abstract Police institutions have been an object of growing concern for several reasons, regarding our difficulty in developing effective mechanisms to control their activity, as well as the perception that they are not efficient in crime control activities. In this paper, we present an overview of the possibilities and limits of police reform proposals, which range from punctual changes to structural shifts, such as the adoption of the complete cycle. In the end, we underline the difficulties to be overcome towards more efficient police forces in Brazil.

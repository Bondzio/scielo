In this article the authors introduce a debate about focus groups and scenarios planning with stakeholders and researchers as methodological tools for qualitative studies on risks aimed to investigate perceptions and needs, to debate proposals and solutions, as well as to promote the participation of the extended peer community in producing knowledge and dealing with risks associated to extreme events and environmental change. Considering this theoretical and methodological approach the paper focuses on two research projects undertaken in urbanizes coastal areas in Brazil (North Coast of SÃ£o Paulo) and in Australia (Nort Cost of Queensland), between 2011 and 2013. The findings highlight that both methods achieved the proposed goals and improved the dialogue and articulation between scientists and stakeholders.
